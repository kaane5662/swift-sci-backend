        "introduction": "This paper critiques the recent use of Marshall Sahlins' model, which opposes big men to chiefs to establish a contrast between Austronesian and Non-Austronesian communities in Oceania. By reviewing Sahlins' model and drawing upon Oceania-wide ethnographic work, I argue that the two opposed paradigms underlying Sahlins' model of leadership, namely achievement and ascription, are in fact entangled in practices and in ideologies. I contend that the cooccurrence of 'achievement' and 'ascription' is widely supported by ethnographies of Oceania; that these two features can simultaneously characterize a single leadership position; and that this dual aspect of leadership is conveyed in Remote Oceania by the indigenous concept of mana. This suggests that the historical analysis of leadership in Oceania should move beyond this the achievement/ascription dichotomy. Thus, instead of mapping the region in terms of their absence or presence, it is more productive to analyse how these features articulate, or to focus on other aspects of leadership in Oceania such as the relation between leaders and deities or ancestors.\nKeywords: big man, chief, typology, Mana, Marshall Sahlins, leadership.\nINTRODUCTION\nGiven the lengthy discussion and numerous criticisms of Marshall Sahlins' (1963) famous model opposing the Melanesian big man and the Polynesian chief, one could imagine that it is unnecessary to revisit this issue. However, despite existing critique, the model continues to inform contemporary historical hypotheses, for instance in the work of Pawley (2020) and Lin and Scaglion (2019).\nIn this paper, rather than relitigating the debate on Sahlins' typology of 'big man' versus 'chief, I principally aim to discuss the use of the opposition between 'ascription' or inheritance and 'achievement' in analysing leadership in Oceania, and in establishing socio-cultural differences between Austronesian (AN) and Non-Austronesian (NAN or Papuan) speaking groups in this region. (1) For instance, ancestral Austronesian language communities had hereditary chiefs, introducing this kind of leadership in Near Oceania and beyond, while already settled Papuan speakers were characterized by big men achieving leadership.\nI argue that achievement and ascription cannot be conceived as mutually exclusive aspects of leadership, and thus, that their purported absence or presence is unhelpful in establishing structural differences between political organizations. I contend that the cooccurrence of 'achievement' and 'ascription' is widely supported by ethnographies of Oceania; that these two features can simultaneously characterize a single leadership position; and that this dual aspect of leadership is contained, in Remote Oceania, in the indigenous concept of mana. Hence, it seems more productive either to analyse the ways that these features articulate rather than thinking in terms of their absence or presence, or to focus on other aspects of leadership in Oceania such as the relation between leaders and deities or ancestors. The discussion of mana shows that the leader/ancestor relation is a potential axis for differentiating Polynesian leadership from others in Oceania.\nI will start by presenting Sahlins' model and its criticisms in order to underline why using it in elaborating historical hypotheses, such as those of Pawley (2020) and Lin and Scaglion (2019), is problematic. Such uses both reify Sahlins' abstractions and ground their hypotheses in a dubious binary opposition between inheritance and achievement as way of identifying structural differences. I first show the concomitance of these two principles in Near Oceania, 'comprising New Guinea (once joined to Australia), the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons as far east as San Cristobal' (Pawley and Green 1973:4), when reviewing Sahlins' model before moving to an examination of these principles in Remote Oceania, 'comprising all other parts of Oceania' (ibid.). Showing that the ambiguous relationship between 'ascription' and 'achievement' in leadership is not restricted to Near Oceania challenges the use of this opposition by the above authors to characterize the difference between Austronesian and non-Austronesian language communities. Given that almost all the communities of Remote Oceania speak an Austronesian language and that Near Oceania is much more diverse {ibid.), if the ambiguity regarding 'achievement' and 'ascription was only characteristic of Near Oceania, one would have to agree with Pawley's or Lin and Scaglion's hypotheses. However, in examining ethnographic data from Remote Oceania, I emphasize that these two principles not only conflate in practices, but also in ideology as conveyed by the notion of mana. This suggests that historical analysis of leadership in Oceania should move beyond this dichotomy, either by focusing on how the two features articulate, or on other aspects of leadership such as the relation between leaders and deities. I hint at these alternatives at the end this paper as further steps for future analysis, before concluding by outlining a common mode of achieving power in Oceania.\nSAHLINS' MODEL: ITS CRITICISMS AND USES\nThough I will expose some limits of Sahlins' typology in this section, it is not my intent to argue that Sahlins' model is wrong, or 'that the ideal types simply did not capture real variation' (Thomas et al. 1989:28). Such variance is intrinsic to the definition of an ideal type, which is a fiction (Weber 2003:T1.I.[section]1.A. 11). (2) I rather intend to underline some limitations inherent to the methodology of the typology's construction.\nSahlins' typology and its criticisms\nSahlins' typology adopts a neo-evolutionist framework, which Sahlins developed earlier with Elmann Service (1960). Drawing upon Leslie White's (1959) work, Service and Sahlins argue that human societies could be ordered according to the quantity of energy they produce and mobilize. Demographic data are thus used as a proxy to assess the degree of energy use. They also assume a link between the social structure and the quantity of energy employed by a society. Hence, they produce classes of societies that are equivalent to evolutionary stages. Among each of these stages, specific types can be identified. These specific forms of societies are thought of as adaptations to a specific ecological and cultural environment. In this way, they realize a synthesis between the general evolution of White (ibid.) and the specific evolution of Steward (1955).\nSahlins' (1963) typology identifies stages of general evolution rather than specific forms, and opposes Melanesia to Polynesia, following a traditional mapping of Oceania (Thomas et al. 1989). The Melanesian big man and the Polynesian chief are kinds of leader, but also types of sociopolitical forms. They are based on five criteria, four of which are related to social structure. Sahlins' (1963:285) method is to construct types by determining common features through 'uncontrolled comparison'.\nThe first difference between Melanesia and Polynesia is the relative size of their polities, which are large in Polynesia and small in Melanesia. Given the homogeneity of their environment and the similarity of their production techniques, Sahlins explains the difference between their spatial and demographic scale in terms of differences in social structure. The other criteria that differentiate the big man from the chief are: the nature of power (ascribed in Polynesia, achieved in Melanesia); the configuration of social units (encompassed and ranked according to genealogical seniority in Polynesia, small and autonomous in Melanesia); the stability of the political system (more stable in Polynesia than in Melanesia); and how economic resources are mobilized in collective activities (through tributes based on the ownership of the land in Polynesia, through a system of obliging gifts in Melanesia).\nSahlins himself explicitly rejected the reduction of his model to the opposition between 'ascribed' and 'achieved' leadership. In his view, these terms 'refer to the means by which persons come to power. They do not designate the types of power as such, the determinate relations of authority, that people in one way or another accede to' (Thomas et al. 1989:36). My concern, rather, is with that strain of criticism that identifies limitations inherent to Sahlins' method, namely the definition of types by common features. (3) In reviewing the limits of Sahlins' model by focusing on method, I do not aim to diminish the interest or value of Sahlins' model. Rather, I highlight its potential heuristic value, and outline problems in how it is used to produce historical reconstructions.",
        "methodology": "Limitations of Sahlins' method\nThe first limitation inherent to Sahlins' method is that description is never exhaustive. This is a limitation both at the level of the criteria and features used to construct the types, and the cases compared in order to construct the types.\nFirst, one can produce alternative typologies of leadership in Oceania by using criteria and features other than those selected by Sahlins. Given that there may be infinite criteria available to differentiate and classify political organizations, one can expect a great diversity of models. This is reflected in the number of models of leadership briefly presented by Mark Mosko (1995) in his paper on Trobriand chieftainship. Mosko himself adds a new model to the list, presenting Trobriand chieftainship in terms of a father-child analogy.\nSecond, the validity of Sahlins' typology can be interrogated by mobilizing alternate ethnographic data. For instance, numerous publications show the presence of chiefs and chiefdom features in Melanesia (Aswani 2000; Aswani and Sheppard 2003; Hviding 1996; Monnerie 1996; Roscoe 2000; Scott 2007). This challenges Sahlins' theoretical distinction between chiefs and Polynesia, on the one hand, and big men and Melanesia, on the other. Anthropologists have thus questioned the validity of Sahlins' typology in empirical terms (Godelier 1982; Meggitt 1971; Strathern 1971). For the Enga, for instance, Meggitt (1971:191) outlines that leadership is ascribed though not inherited. Moreover, to correct the idea that inherited leaders do not exist among Papuan speakers (Pawley 2020), one must recall that there was an inherited position among the Enga, the Watenge or great war leader (Wiessner and Tumu 1998:290) or, among the Huli, the agali haguene (Ballard 1995).\nBoth these limitations of Sahlins' method are evident in Godelier's study of the Bamya. In his monograph on the Baruya, Godelier (1982) coins another type of sociopolitical system in contrast to Sahlins' 'big man': the 'great men'. Godelier entirely reframes Sahlins' typology, while keeping the word 'big man' and leaving aside the chiefs and their chiefdoms. The presence of hereditary features among the Baruya is worth noting too. Among them, privileged lineages own kwaimatnie, which are divine objects allowing their owners to play a crucial role in the initiations of young men, which are central to the making of leaders. These sacred artefacts are inherited and give their owner a control over the reproduction of social organization and the production of men and great men. Building on Godelier's work, Lemonnier (1990) departs even further from Sahlins' model by considering other cases and mobilizing alternative criteria to build types.\nNevertheless, one cannot really criticize Sahlins for not considering cases that were unknown to him when he wrote, or for not selecting criteria that appeared unnecessary to solve his problem of explaining differences in size of polities between Melanesia and Polynesia in evolutionary terms, despite their similar material culture and environment.\nAnother limitation of Sahlins' method is its reliance on the absence or presence of features to mark differences. Social characteristics thought to be opposed are often compatible in practice across different contexts. This is true for the opposition between 'achievement' and 'ascription', as I will show below, but also for other similarly constructed models. For instance, Dousset's (2018a, 2019) analysis of marriage rules among the Ngaatjatjarra of Western Australia in relation to Levi-Strauss' (1967) model illustrates this contextual flexibility. In his ethnography, Dousset shows that symmetric exchange, though enunciated as a norm, is subordinated to other rules and to context. Among the Ngaatjatjarra, a first marriage changes the consubstantial relation between in-laws, which prohibits the realization of the enunciated rule of symmetric exchange. The new context, resulting from a prescribed rule, thus collapses Levi-Strauss' neat ordering of marriage rules. If features are not exclusive, the possibility of constructing a typology based on their absence or presence becomes dubious. Rather, an approach focusing on how features articulate with each other should be preferred, as suggested below in the case of 'achievement' and 'ascription'.\nRegarding Sahlins' typology, the features that define the two sociopolitical types, in reality, appear together, as is attested by numerous ethnographies of Melanesian communities. Indeed, some studies have noted the coexistence of different types of leadership and their respective principles in one single community (Ballard 1995; Chowning 1979; Dousset 2018a; Hviding 1996; Keesing 1985, 1997; Lilley 1985; Lowman-Vayda 1971; Oliver 1955; Roscoe 2000; Ross 1973, 1978; Wiessner and Tumu 1998).\nThough Oliver's study of Siuai, specially the mumi, is often perceived as the main empirical ground for Sahlins' 'big man', a careful reading of Oliver's ethnography equally shows the non-exclusivity of Sahlins' types and the non-exclusivity of some of their features. Among the Siuai communities of the 1930s, there was a position, to which certain rights and functions were attached, and to which the eldest child of a matrilineage (noroukuru) was ideally appointed. They were called simiri ('the first-born'; ibid.:82-84). Locals also told Oliver that, in the past, a man had to be the son of a mumi (the leader of men's clubhouse) and the grandson (DS) of a mumi to be a mumi himself (ibid.:419).\nFurthermore, the Siuai were indeed structured into matrilineages (noroukuru), from which rights to land were derived, and whose members were liable for the offences committed by any others (ibid.:82-84, 111). Thus, matrilineages organized households (the smallest social unit) when there was no mumi or, when one mumi had emerged, in parallel with his men's club (ibid.:46-61, 82-85, 111, 245-246, 283; see also Oliver 1968).\nBesides, the ethnographic data are ambiguous regarding the mumi's 'personal power' and self-made factions. The mumi achieved power and created his men's society only to a certain extent. He equally depended on inherited kin relations, on the preexistence of a 'neighbourhood' and on matrilineal affiliations. The beginning of a mumi's career depended on the help of some close kin. These relatives encouraged him to become a mumi by unilaterally transferring him unbinding wealth, thus contradicting the obliging gift logic of big man systems. However, the aspiring mumi subsequently had to use this provided wealth to create obligations to mobilize people in the organization of collective events. Thus, it is possible to argue that the mumi constituted his own factions through his 'investment' activities, as much as he was made by those who transferred unbinding wealth to him (ibid.:105, 329, 388, 421-424). In other words, his power was both 'ascribed' and 'achieved' in Sahlins' terms. (4)\nFrom this examination of Oliver's study, it appears that not only ascribed and achieved leaders coexist in single communities depending on social contexts, but that these two principles may inhere in a single kind of leader, whether in Sahlins' sense or not. This calls into question whether the ascription/achievement binary opposition adequately differentiates leadership systems.\nHowever, these limitations are only problematic if we see Sahlins' model as a more or less accurate reflection of sociocultural realities as evidenced by ethnographies, rather than as an ideal type, the fictive status of which helps us to characterize the specificities of different settings. This second approach to Sahlins' typology is well illustrated by Lilley's (1985) assessment of Siassi leadership.\nIn contrast, when the model is used as a heuristic tool to formulate historical hypotheses regarding the division between Austronesian and non-Austronesian languages communities, these limitations are often overlooked even though they undermine these hypotheses. To make this point clear, I will now examine the recent papers of Pawley (2020) and Lin and Scaglion (2019) and their use of Sahlins' types.\nUsing Sahlins' model for formulating historical hypotheses\nWhen Lilley (1985) first refers to Sahlins' typology, he uses them as ideal types, which allows him to model Siassi leadership while identifying the limits of those types. However, in his discussion, he appears to accept their validity as the basis for formulating historical hypotheses. According to one of these hypotheses, which Pawley, Lin and Scaglion support, the big man type was a Papuan system prior to contact with Austronesian speaking people (3000 BP). In this approach, Sahlins' big man becomes a social form from which Melanesian communities as described in ethnographies would have evolved or, alternatively, devolved, thus explaining the cooccurrence of different kinds of leadership. A reverse hypothesis, similarly problematic, explains the concomitant leadership features as a recent devolution from chiefdoms to big man system (e.g. Keesing 1985).\nIn such arguments, the divergence between the typology and the ethnographic data is brought to light by comparison that results in the formulation of historical hypotheses, which solve the 'contradiction' between the model and empirical data by projecting the types into the past. Such hypotheses tried to explain the divergence between ethnographies and the model by avoiding questioning the latter, and further by treating the models as reflections of reality rather than as ideal types. In other words, the types are reified. They are assumed to be empirically valid, as reality of the past, even though inconsistencies exist between the types and the ethnographies from which they are abstracted.\nThis reasoning is found in Scaglion (1996) and Lin and Scaglion (2019). The authors start from the divergence between Sahlins' model and ethnographies, then explain the disparity by reifying the anthropological model, and by shifting the comparative focus of the model to another cultural opposition between Papuan and Austronesian speaking communities. It is important to recognize another erroneous aspect of the development of their argument. The authors claim that Sahlins developed the big man type almost exclusively from ethnographies of non-Austronesian linguistic groups:\nYet, according to Sahlins (1963:288) himself, he drew on no fewer than 20 cases to construct his Melanesian type. Some of his references deal with different communities like Hogbin's (1937) account of Guadalcanal. When considering the ethnographic sources and the linguistic classification on glottolog, at least 7 of the 20 references relate to Austronesian language speakers. (5) Even in Pawley (1982:38), Lin and Scaglion's assertion is contradicted. This claim is important to Scaglion and Lin because their argument focusses on the social forms of proto-societies. In their analysis, Sahlins' big man model is identified with NAN speaking Melanesia and egalitarianism, and is juxtaposed to Sand's (2002) model of chiefs and hierarchy, which they identify with AN speakers.\nSuch a usage of Sahlins' typology can also be seen in Pawley (1982, 2020), Kirch and Green (1992, 2001), and to a lesser extent in Kirch (2010). In simplifying their approach, once phylogenetic units have been established, mostly from linguistic groups, and once proto-terms have been elaborated, ethnographic comparison and anthropological models are mobilized to attribute meaning to proto-terms. Sahlins' model is thus used as a translation tool for etymons. The similarities between sociocultural traits, which are conveyed by vernacular terms for which an etymon has been constructed, are assessed and considered as homologies depending on their geographic distribution. This does not imply that every cognate shares the same meaning. In establishing similarities within the diversity of ethnographic cases, the anthropological model facilitates the identification of inherited traits.\nHowever, according to this logic, the term for 'chief is assumed to be univocal. Furthermore, the identification of vernacular terms, which are thought of as cognates and are translated by 'chief, supposedly allow inferring a similarity of features related to these terms. For example, they would reflect an inherited status, which is a characteristic of chieftainship. Thus, generalizing such a method and applying the models to former societies seem empirically grounded. However, one may wonder why some of the inferred ancestral features by the phylogenetic method are absent among some members of a phylogenetic group. Hence, a second hypothesis should be formulated, which is not based on semantic 'reconstruction'. Regarding the particular use of Sahlins' model in such an approach, if it is linguistically established that chiefs are an inherited cultural feature of Austronesian language societies, then divergences from this original state can be explained by mobilizing the opposed type (the 'big man'). The latter is associated with the residual group, namely Papuans, in relation to which the phylogenetic group has been defined, Austronesian. Thus, chieftainship is linked to Oceanic (Austronesian) societies by semantic reconstructions, and big men systems are linked to Papuans as an hypothesis. Historical features of big men systems among Austronesian speakers are thus explained by Papuan influence, and inversely, chiefly aspects among Papuans are explained by an influence from Austronesians.\nNotwithstanding the problem of reification, this would be valid if the notion of 'chief were univocal, which it is not, just as the notions of 'ascribed' and 'achievement' are not. The meanings attributed by Sahlins to 'ascription' and 'achievement', and the meanings they have for Sahlins' readers, highlight the ambiguity of the concepts. Consequently, the mere reference to 'chief to translate leadership vernacular terms does not permit us to infer the characteristics of these leaders. This is probably why Kirch and Green (2001) and Pawley (2020) undertake ethnographic comparisons themselves in their semantic 'reconstructions'. Nevertheless, while doing so, they import the limitations of Sahlins' method for building anthropological models, and more specifically the problem of relying on binary oppositions such as the dichotomy between 'ascribed' and 'achieved'. The question of whether the model or the criteria on which it is grounded are appropriate to reflect structural differences is overlooked. Hence, Pawley (1982, 2020), Kirch and Green (2001), alongside Hage (1999), Bellwood (2006), Scaglion (1996), Lin and Scaglion (2019), Lichtenberk (1986) and Hayden (1983) incorporate within their hypothesis the problems and limitations of Sahlins' method, especially the idea of exclusive social features. This purported exclusivity of leadership features is not evidenced by practices, at least for ethnographies related to Near Oceania. Furthermore, this concomitance of features pertaining to chief or big man types is also present in Remote Oceania, as I will show in the next section. This calls into question Pawley's or Lin and Scaglion's hypotheses. Drawing upon ethnographic data from this region, I claim that the two aspects of leadership are regularly intertwined, and that this entanglement is conveyed in the indigenous notion of mana.\nTHE AMBIGUITY OF LEADERSHIP IN REMOTE OCEANIA: ACHIEVEMENT, ASCRIPTION AND MANA\nAs argued above, Pawley (2020) and Lin and Scaglion (2019) use the dichotomy between ascribed (inherited) and achieved leadership as a criterion of cultural and social differentiation. In doing so, I argue that they import a limitation inherent to Sahlins' method into their historical hypotheses, namely the non-necessary exclusivity of social features.\nThese authors claim that systems of rank and hereditary leaders are an ancestral feature of Austronesian settlers, in contrast with Papuan, or non-Austronesian speakers of Oceania:\nTherefore, the weakening or the purported disappearance of those hereditary leaders among Austronesian speakers in Near Oceania is to be explained through Papuan influence. Yet, as I argue, such an argument is based on a structural distinction that is dubious.\nThese two features of leadership occur simultaneously in communities of both Austronesian and non-Austronesian language speakers across the whole of Oceania. In reality, hereditary and achieved aspects of leaders are entangled. In other words, according to ethnographic data, there is a divergence between power practices and ideology, especially one taking the form of a system of ranks according to genealogical seniority or a rule of primogeniture. However, this disparity must be and actually is locally conceived. Hence, I argue that this duality of leadership is also present in the ideology, making the latter equivocal. In Remote Oceania, the term mana reflects this ideological ambiguity between hereditary and achieved leadership principles.\nThe ambiguity of power in Oceania\nThe coexistence of ascription and achievement has been underlined by ethnographic comparative studies for Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia (Douglas 1979; Marcus 1989; Petersen 1999). Douglas (1979), while objecting to Sahlins' typology, shows that the concomitance of features could be demonstrated in ethnographic accounts of Polynesian communities as well as Melanesian communities. Her main focus was to argue that 'achievement' and 'ascription' coexisted in Melanesian and Polynesian political organizations (Siuai, Melpa, Manus, Kanak, Maori, Tonga, Samoa, and Tahiti). More specifically, using Kanak societies as an example Douglas (ibid.: 16-18) underlines a divergence between practices and a hereditary ideology. Drawing on Guiart and Leenhardt, she also mentions other principles that are involved in attributing and preserving power that are related to leaders' acts:\nNot only is there a disparity between practices and ideology of genealogical seniority, but other principles seem more important than seniority in determining power and authority (if not status). Among Kanak, 'achievement' and 'ascription' are entangled in practices and in their ideology of power.\nExamining leadership in Micronesia, Petersen (1999) also raises the issue of 'achieved' versus 'ascribed' leadership in a cultural context in which seniority is a common idiom for leadership. Petersen questions the importance of hereditary aspects of ranking systems by reversing the relationship between seniority and status. In Sahlins' or Pawley's papers, Polynesian or Austronesian leaders hold their positions and status as a result of inheritance and according to birth order. Yet, Petersen puts it the other way around. Seniority and rank result from power relations so that rank appears to be more achieved than ascribed:\nThese two aspects of power coexist not only in practices, but also in discourse across both Micronesia and Polynesia (Petersen 1999:387), recalling Goldman's (1970) stress on competition in Polynesian societies. Though Petersen acknowledges that systems of ranks may be an ancestral cultural feature of first Austronesian speaking settlers in Oceania, he simultaneously underlines that ranking results more from achievement than inheritance.\nFor Polynesia, Marcus (1989) shows that there are also ambiguities in leadership ideologies. He emphasizes the duality of Polynesian chiefs. On the one hand, the chief is a 'sacred king', but, on the other hand, he is also a 'populist king'. (6) As an ideal of person-hood (the 'populist' aspect), the chief is nothing if not the first among peers, or a 'prince among the men' to employ Sahlins' description of 'big men'. 'A chiefs personal status is socially defined in terms normally applied to common people' (Marcus 1989:190). Simultaneously however, the chief is separated from the commoners due to his sacredness.\nCoexistence of inherited and achieved leadership thus seems to prevail in Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, or according to another mapping of Oceania, both in Near and Remote Oceania. This ambiguity is not only a question of disparity between practice and ideology, since it can be found in indigenous concepts, as we will see in the notion of mana.\nMana, a concept containing dual aspects of leadership\nThe literature on mana has become extensive since the introduction of the concept by Codrington (1891), and I do not intend to deal with it exhaustively here. (7) I do not address every semantic implication of mana either, such as its relations with the terms noa and tapu (Shore 1989). Rather, I strive to determine the consequences of some meanings of mana for modes of leadership and the dichotomy between achieved and ascribed power.\nIn 'Rethinking Mana', Keesing (1984) raises the question of the original meaning of mana and polysemy in Oceania. Keesing claims that mana first refers to a quality (being efficacious, true, etc.) rather than a substance, contending that the conception of mana as a substance is due to Codrington's ethnocentrism and error. However, Keesing (ibid.:151-152) acknowledges that in Polynesia mana indeed meant a sacred substance, especially when the leaders were associated with deities. It remains the case, however, that, according to Keesing's (ibid.: 146-147,152) data, mana in Polynesian languages refers as much to a quality as to a divine substance.\nHowever, the dual meaning of mana is also reported outside of Polynesia, which calls into question the ascription of a relatively univocal meaning of the proto-oceanic term *mana. Given the language grouping, and if this ambiguity of mana was only present in Polynesian languages, its meaning as a substance could be considered a Polynesian innovation. However, mana as a noun and a substance seems to have been its principal semantic use in northern Vanuatu (Blust 2007; Francois 2013; Kolshus 2013), and its dual meaning is also present in Micronesia (Keesing 1984:144). The northern Vanuatu data, and especially the Banks islands, thus weaken Keesing's critique of Codrington. Kolshus (2013) does suggest that the concept and its usage as a substantive noun has been imported from Tikopia by migrants to the Banks archipelago. Kolshus further argues that missionaries transferred the term with this meaning and grammatical form to the south of the Solomon Islands. This hypothesis supports Keesing's claim regarding the original meaning of mana. However, a similar argument may not be applicable in Micronesia, undermining any hypothesis about what might have been the original meaning and use of mana. (8) In examining the relationship between mana and leadership features, I thus consider mana to have a double meaning: as a quality and as a divine substance.\nIf mana is a quality, it conveys the idea of an achieved power. Given that mana refers to a state of efficacy that is confirmed after the effective realization of some acts, a leader is mana to the extent that he actualizes and manifests his power by his achievements. He is mana when his acts are mana. In other words, since mana is the ex-post qualification that something is efficient, or equally that someone is favoured by the deities (gods or spirits), somebody is a leader as long as his acts are mana. His power is achieved. This is also one of Keesing's (1984:151) conclusions. We can thus assume that mana as efficacy conveys the idea of achieved power. What changes when mana is thought of as a divine substance, and in what circumstances is this the case? Keesing points to sacred Polynesian kingdoms and some secret Melanesian societies. In the former, the meaning results from a rationalization of chiefs' holiness; in the latter, it is supposedly the outcome of secret knowledge. In Polynesian kingdoms, mana could indeed be a concept that enables a conception of the consubstantiality between deities and leaders. In Melanesia, the existence of mana as a divine substance could be equally explained by this reason. In graded societies of Vanuatu, distinguished from secret societies given their hierarchical aspect (Dousset 2018a, 2018b, Forthcoming), the highest-ranked leader is closely associated with ancestral spirits: 'The one who reached the top of the hierarchy is mana because he has achieved unity between opposed worlds: he is a \"living dead'\" (Guerard 1994:168, my translation). Mana, therefore, becomes a substance when the consubstantiality of some men and deities (gods, spirits, ghosts, etc.) is at stake. (9)\nIn examining how this consubstantiality is established, especially in Hawaii, it is possible to show that mana as a substance conveys ideas of ascribed as well as achieved leadership. The embodiment of mana-substance has been used to underline the hereditary feature of Polynesian leadership, and its ancestral forms (the *qariki). Thus, according to Pawley (2020:230), '[b]y virtue of their inherited rank *qariki had mana \"supernatural efficacy, the power to make things happen\" and were tapu \"sacred, set apart by taboos'\". This idea comes from Kirch and Green (2001), who themselves draw on Shore's (1989) analysis:\nFor these authors, the hereditary characteristic of Polynesian leaders is essential, and their status is legitimized by the transmission of mana that they receive from ancestors (see also Kirch 2010:38).\nMana, rank, status and leadership positions thus appear to result from birth and seniority. Inheritance is a first way to establish consubstantiality with deities and ancestors. However, to this first mode of transmission should be added another: rituals. If among graded societies of Vanuatu, rituals and sacrifices might have been the only way to become consubstantial with deities, in Polynesia this process was dual since mana was acquired by birth and through rituals.\nInterestingly, Kirch (2010:48) also depicts mana as a quality and shows cases in which genealogical seniority is subordinated to other principles:\nMana thus becomes the result of a person's acts, rather than a divine substance transmitted patrilineally. Mana is acquired by achievement rather than inherited. Not only does this underline the flexibility of the Hawaiian political system, but also how this flexibility could be conceived. Here again, achieved and ascribed features are conflated:\nKirch depicts mana as a quality resulting from accomplishments and as a substance. To grasp the acquired aspect of mana as a substance, one must consider the ritual practices.\nThe duality of mana transmission is explicit in Valeri's (1985:99) analysis of Hawaiian rituals:\nRitual activity consists in tying mana to places (the mana house), to objects (the sculpted figure of the god), or to sacrificial food, which is consumed by the king and priests. Through this consumption of sacred food, kings, priests and the deities are made consubstantial (ibid.:56-59). (10) This aspect of mana transmission is also apparent in the transitive Hawaiian verb ho'omana, which Valeri (ibid.:103) translates as '\"to make something mana\" by transferring the god or the god's mana to it'. Consubstantiality with the deities could also be performed by occupying the place of the deity in ritual and by acts rather than inheritance (ibid.:149, 153). This seems to have been the case when Captain Cook acted as Lono and was worshiped as such (Sahlins 1989; Valeri 1985:103).\nOnly realizations and acts establish a unity between leaders and deities, something that also allows and legitimizes usurpation. More than systematic inherited positions, wars and usurpations prevailed in Hawaii. The determination of succession relied less on genealogical seniority than on a contender's acquired support, highlighting the importance of achievements in power relations. Kingdoms and kings are thus never inherited, but rather are acquired by conquest and kept through constant effort (Valeri 1985:159-60). Moreover, similar to Petersen's account of Micronesia, Valeri (ibid.:157, 187) argues that power relations determine genealogical ranks rather than the reverse. The association between the deity and the leader concludes the conquest, and is established after having acquired the highest position. This is done through the performance of rituals and sacrifices to gods. However, this also happens in the process of conquest, by sacrificing other contenders assimilated to brothers and marrying their wives who are thus sisters to the winning king. Thus, even in Hawaii, where chiefdoms are supposed to have reached their highest forms, both features of leadership are entangled. The notion of mana as a substance reflects this entanglement insofar as it is thought of as being transmitted through descent and acquired by ritual actions.\nThis section has argued that ascribed and achieved aspects of leadership coexist in practices and ideologies in Remote Oceania and especially in Polynesia. The concept of mana embodies the ways through which inherited and acquired leadership can become conflated, especially in communities that value genealogical seniority. As a consequence, if the wide distribution of ranks according to genealogical seniority leads us to assume that it is an ancestral feature of Austronesian populations in Oceania, the same could be said about the ambiguity of power and leadership. Both ascription and inheritance can characterize leaders among Autronesian and non-Austronesian language communities. While this does not mean that there is no difference between political systems in Oceania, or for instance between Hawaii and the Melpa, the idea of hereditary leaders as being proper to Austronesian communities as proposed by Pawley, Lin and Scaglion is nevertheless dubious.\nThis confirms that the absence or presence of inheritance principles is not an appropriate criterion for differentiating Austronesian cultures from Papuan ones, the heterogeneity of the latter notwithstanding. Furthermore, I would suggest that if a structural difference is to be explored, it should rather be the articulation of ascription and achievement. In some ethnographies, such as for the Siuai (Oliver 1955) or Lamap (Dousset 2018b), these principles seem to be dissociated from each other, and refer to separate kinds of leaders. However, in Siuai the situation is ambiguous regarding the mumi, which is clearly an hereditary leader in the neighbouring region, Buin. In others, for instance in Micronesia and Polynesia, they seem intertwined. The relationship between a leader and deities could also constitute a means of differentiating traditional sociopolitical organizations in Oceania. The criterion here lies in whether the leader is identified with a deity--is consubstantial with it--or whether he has just a privileged connection with supernatural beings, which seems the dominant form in some part of Near Oceania, like the Solomons (Hviding 1996; Monnerie 1996; Oliver 1955; Ross 1973; Scheffler 1965). Most often these supernatural beings are localized spirits of a place that has been settled or are ancestors whose sanctuary links the living with the place they settled, or both. Perhaps these hints of structural differences could be the product of historical divergence after a period of cultural convergence when Austronesians populations migrated and settled in Near Oceania. However, this does not mean it would be a characteristic proper to Austronesian language communities in opposition to Papuans as it has been asserted regarding the idea of hereditary leader. To support this idea, the ethnography of the Baruya in the New Guinean Highlands by Godelier (1982) is again helpful. Among the Baruya, at the top of the social hierarchy stands the hereditary owners of kwaimatnie, who belong to a same lineage and 'are intermediaries between the sun and the men' (Godelier 1980:247, my translation). The kwaimatnie is a magical object that has been given by the sun to a specific clan, and which gives the strength from the sun to the bodies of young men during initiations. Here, the relationship to the supernatural is also at the core of leadership, but in contrast with ethnographies of the Solomons, it does not include a relation to the ground. This suggests further complications for the comparison, since the relationship between leaders and supernatural beings involve a third aspect, namely a relation to a territory. This kind of comparison of how achieved and ascribed leadership articulate could be developed further to produced more grounded historical hypotheses, although doing so lies beyond the scope of this article.",

        "limitations": "CONCLUSION: A COMMON MODE OF ACHIEVEMENT\nTo conclude, I would like to emphasize a final point, which could, on the one hand, suggest a past cultural convergence or, on the other hand, point toward further similarity of political practices in Oceania.\nDrawing upon existing literature, I underlined that beyond Near Oceania, leadership was also achieved in Remote Oceania. While the ways a person can gain influence and achieve leadership are varied, one of them echoes the economic behaviour of the big man as depicted by Sahlins.\nIn Micronesia, Petersen (1999:370, 388) describes how competition for leadership is founded in food redistribution during agonistic feasts, or through gifts. In Hawaii, the conquest of a kingdom required that a contender build up his own faction. While Valeri writes that the constitution of factions is not well known, the indigenous history of 'Umi and how he conquered Hawaii, as told by Kamakau in the 19th century and reported by Kirch (2010:94-96), gives some clues. 'Umi was the son of a commoner woman, but because he is acknowledged by his father, an ali'i, as his son, 'Umi was ritually elevated to this rank. After his father's death, the leadership passed to his half-brother. Given the threatening behavior of the latter, 'Umi escaped in the mountains and lived again as a commoner. The struggle continued, until 'Umi won the fight through his superiority and his achievements. 'Being handsome and skilled, 'Umi stood out, and attracted four young women to be his wives', Kirch (ibid.:96) reports. 'Umi managed to build up a faction through his generosity and by redistributing food:\nIn other words, because of 'Umi's capacity to produce, his numerous marriages, and his redistribution, 'Umi attracted followers, raising an army through his mobilization of wealth. The story suggests some features from Marcus' populist chief, along with others from Sahlins' Melanesian big man. The tale probably conveys the norms of behaviour for a leader whose legitimacy is partly grounded in his ancestry, but more fundamentally through his achievement and his heroic stature.\nTo clarify, I do not contend that achievement is the sole determinant of leadership and power relations, but rather highlight that redistribution and gifts is a significant factor in accounts of Micronesian and Polynesian 'traditional' politics as well as in Melanesia. This blurs the lines that Sahlins had drawn, and which Pawley or Lin and Scaglion are still applying, though on a different cultural or linguistic map. I do, however, recognize that the similar paths to achieve power by redistributing wealth may hide a difference in how resources are made available to a becoming leader. However, what stands out from ethnographies is that a person attracts followers and gains support through his gifts, whether in Near or Remote Oceania.\nThis paper has presented two linked arguments. Not only is the binary juxtaposition of 'ascription' or 'achievement' inappropriate as a basis for drawing cultural or social borders or formulating historical hypotheses related to them, it is also inappropriate as a basis for proposing structural contrasts in the mode of achieving power. The use of such binary oppositions in historical hypotheses regarding ancestral societies must be put aside, not only because there is a gap between practice and ideology, but also because there is ambiguity in ideology itself, as is the case with the term mana. This argument against the use of Sahlins' model by Pawley, Lin and Scaglion is a first step in going beyond this opposition between achievement and ascription, which I hope to pursue by developing the alternatives I have hinted to at the end of the last section.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI wish to profusely thank those whose discussion, comments or suggestions helped me in the process of writing this paper: the two anonymous reviewers and the editors of Oceania, Jocelyn Aznar, Christopher Ballard, Laurent Dousset, Aurelien Esgonniere du Thibeuf and David Glory. This work has benefited from financial support from the CNRS through the 80 Prime program.\nENDNOTES\n(1.) In this paper, although the division between Near and Remote Oceania seems more appropriate, with the latter distinguishing Melanesia east of the Solomons. I follow the mapping used by the authors discussed in this article when considering their work. Thus, reference to the division of Oceania in Melanesia. Micronesia and Polynesia will occur in parallel to the division between Near and Remote Oceania.\n(2.) Whether Sahlins himself viewed his typology as ideal types or as a representation of broad patterns is unclear.\n(3.) This method is widely used in anthropology. This is how Kirch (2010) considers Hawaii at the end of the eighteenth century to have been an 'archaic state'. Godelier's (1982) monograph and Lemonnier's (1990) study of leadership in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea, which employ types such as 'great men' and 'socie'te a leader', or Ploeg's (2020) detailed examination of Western Papuan ethnographies, rely on the same approach as well. On another note, Descola's (2005) model of how 'collectives' relate to their environment is constructed in a similar fashion.\n(4.) Similar divergences can also be identified when comparing Sahlins' types with other ethnographies of Melanesian communities (Keesing 1965; Ross 1973; Scheffler 1965). and lead to similar conclusions. Regarding the Baegu and the Kwaio, these differences were noted by Ross (1978) and Keesing (1985) respectively.\n(5.) https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/orok1269; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/guad1241; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/manu 1262; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/tang1355; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/long1395; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/huon1245; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/arap1279; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/adze1240; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/kuma1280; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/nots1237; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/siwa1245; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/toab1237; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/ekar1243; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/sout2857; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/nduu1242 https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/west2573: https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/sout2949; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/gahu1246; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/kyak1244; https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/enga1252;\nAccessed 8 June 2023.\n(6.) Marcus' (1989:193) conclusion is worth quoting regarding the recent uses of Sahlins' model: 'the kingly/populist continuum developed in this paper effectively collapses the chief/big man distinction used by Sahlins, in his now classic 1963 paper contrasting Polynesia and Melanesia emblematically by type of political leadership and organization. It suggests not only that chiefs who share much in common with Melanesian big men are to be found in Polynesia, but that big men who share much in common with chiefs, and in fact are chiefs, are to be found in Melanesia'.\n(7.) A great review of this literature can be found in present in a Tomlinson and Kawika Tengan's (2016) edited collection, which renews the interest in mana.\n(8.) Other hypotheses regarding the 'original' meaning of mana have been offered by Blust (2007) and Blevins (2008). I do not have the space to discuss them here.\n(9.) Dousset (forthcoming) suggests that there may be a Polynesian influence on the origin of graded societies in Vanuatu. One could therefore wonder whether the identification of a leader with a deity in Oceania might be a Polynesian cultural trait.\n(10.) The link between mana and acts of binding, wrapping, tying, and containing has been noted by others (Mondragon 2004; Shore 1989). This act of binding to make things tapu is also present in Near Oceania, for instance in the Solomons.",

        "introduction": "Background\nThe anxiety and their related disorders (AD) are the most common of all mental health conditions, and affect approximately 20% of pregnant and postpartum people. They are associated with significant distress and life interference for sufferers, as well as negative consequences for fetal and infant development. At present, little if any routine screening for prenatal AD is being conducted and data regarding the most effective tools to screen for these disorders is lacking. The majority of screening studies suffer from methodological difficulties which undermine the confidence needed to recommend measures for population distribution. The primary purpose of this research is to identify the most accurate self-report tool(s) to screen for perinatal AD.\nIntroduction\nFor many health conditions, screening is the first step in a pathway to effective, and in some cases lifesaving, interventions [1-3]. It allows for population level early disease detection thereby identifying those in need of further assessment and ultimately treatment. Further, screening provides significant cost savings [4-8] by ensuring that only those who require more time and labour-intensive diagnostic assessments are offered them [4, 8-10]. Although screening for mental health conditions has been shown to lead to improved mental health even in the absence of a clear pathway to treatment [11, 12], there are still several gaps in screening for mental health conditions in Canada, particularly in the perinatal period [13].\nThe current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [14] includes ten anxiety disorders and several anxiety-related disorders (AD). For the purposes of this research, we have defined AD to include all DSM-5 anxiety disorders as well as two anxiety-related disorders: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [14]. The AD affect one in five pregnant and postpartum people [15], and are of high importance for perinatal people both due to the fact that they are highly prevalent, but also because they are associated with a range of negative reproductive health outcomes [15-17]. These include: obstetrical (e.g., miscarriage, low birth weight, preterm delivery) [16, 18-21]; fetal and infant (e.g., impaired self-regulation and motor development, and an increased risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) [16, 22-28]; and the birthing parent (e.g., postpartum depression, reduced employment capacity, unemployment, and decreased social, emotional and physical functioning) [16, 17, 29-35]. The AD are also associated with significant health care costs and increased health care service utilization [36-39].\nRoutine screening for perinatal depression is employed in many parts of the world [40-42]. This has been made possible through the availability of screening tools for perinatal depression of high and well-established accuracy [43, 44]. Despite the fact that, among perinatal people, AD are significantly more common that perinatal depression (21% for perinatal AD, and approximately 6% for perinatal depression) [15, 45] screening for these conditions is almost non-existent [4]. This is largely the result of a lack of identifiable screening tools with established and high accuracy [46]. Numerous self-report screening tools for perinatal AD have been developed and to some extent evaluated [47]. More than one may, in fact, prove to be highly accurate. However, assessments of their accuracy have been burdened by methodological weaknesses of sufficient magnitude such that, at present, no screening tool for perinatal AD can be recommended with confidence [48].\nWhat makes the establishment of broadly disseminated screening for perinatal AD so appealing is the following. First, perinatal people are highly accepting of screening programs, but tend not to discuss their mental health difficulties unless asked about them [4, 49]. Consequently, without screening, perinatal AD will often go undetected [50]. Second is the recent increase in the availability and acceptability of highly effective, evidence-based treatments for perinatal AD. Specifically, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), a form of talk therapy, is the treatment of choice for many anxiety-related conditions. Randomized controlled trials comparing CBT with medication approaches have found that CBT is safe and equal or superior to medication [51-53], and a recent systematic review found CBT to effective for perinatal populations [54]. Historically, access to CBT has been limited and not broadly publicly funded due to the fact that it is time-consuming and expensive [55-57]. More recently, however, CBT has become increasingly available in self-administered and online formats, greatly improving accessibility [58, 59], without any loss in effectiveness [60, 61]. Accordingly, when screening leads to appropriate treatment, positive outcomes are highly likely.\nThe need for accurate, evidence-based screening tools is now more critical in light of recent urgent calls by various healthcare agencies for perinatal AD screening, and guidance regarding screening tool selection. These include the Perinatal Services BC [62], the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [63], MGH Centre for Women's Mental Health [64].\nAs population-wide administration of screening programs is a large, expensive undertaking, and the primary determinant of who will receive more costly diagnostic assessments, ensuring that resources are well spent is critical and can only be achieved when valid screening tools are employed. To be valid, screening tools must demonstrate a high level of accuracy when compared with gold standard diagnostic assessments. For this to occur, very specific research methodology is required. The Cochrane Screening & Diagnostic Tests Methods Group recommends the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) [48, 65] as the criteria of choice for assessing studies of diagnostic accuracy [65-67]. QUADAS-2 criteria were also formally accepted by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Councils [4]. The QUADAS-2 criteria are outlined below, with some language adjusted to reflect requirements when screening for mental health difficulties among perinatal people. Specifically, assessments of perinatal AD screening tools should:\n1. employ a representative or unselected general sample of pregnant and/or postpartum people;\n2. assess screening tool(s) against gold standard diagnostic assessments (for mental health conditions, semi-structured diagnostic interview);\n3. assess, minimally, the core AD with or without OCD and PTSD;\n4. ensure diagnostic assessments are conducted blind to screening test(s) results;\n5. ensure appropriate timing between screening and diagnostic assessment; and\n6. power to adequately detect the above metrics.\nBeyond the above methodological criteria needed to correctly assess screening tool accuracy, studies assessing screening tool accuracy must also report screening tool metrics sufficient to allow an assessment of accuracy. Specifically, studies should measure diagnostic accuracy, reporting minimally, area under the curve (AUC), and sensitivity and specificity at specified cut-offs (both with 95% Confidence Limits). The AUC, sensitivity and specificity should also be reported independently of other disorders (e.g., depression). To merit broad dissemination, screening tool metrics should meet a certain threshold of accuracy. In our opinion, the empirical literature supports the following minimum criteria be met for a screening tool to be deemed \"sufficiently accurate\" as to merit implementation [68-70]:\n1. An AUC of [greater than or equal to] 0.8 ([greater than or equal to] 0.8 is generally considered excellent) [71].\n2. A Youden's \"J \" index (Youden 1950) of [greater than or equal to] 0.5 (i.e., when sensitivity = 0.75, specificity [greater than or equal to] 0.75).\n3. A negative predictive value (NPV) [greater than or equal to] 0.8.\n4. A positive likelihood ratio (LR +) of [greater than or equal to] 4.0. A LR + of 4.0 means that with a positive test result, the probability the person has the disease increases 25% over pre-test probability [72].\nThe overwhelming consensus from the perinatal AD screening literature, and experts in the field, is that the evidence meets neither: (a) the necessary methodological criteria described above, nor (b) the threshold of \"sufficiently accurate\" outcome metrics. Consequently, the evidence base remains inadequate to enable clear recommendations regarding optimal screening practice [4, 6]. Although a large number of potential AD screening tools have been evaluated within perinatal populations and several reviews of this literature have been published [4, 6, 40, 73, 74], all published studies are hampered by one or more important methodological weakness. These include: failing to assess the full composite of the AD; reporting insufficient metrics [75-78]; reporting accuracy for depression and AD combined [75, 77, 78]; employing selected rather than representative or unselected samples (e.g., specific groups of perinatal people are excluded such as those with depression or medical risk in pregnancy) and administering diagnostic interviews prior to the administration of screening tools, influencing screening tool completion [79-84].\nTo our knowledge, only two studies of perinatal AD screening tool accuracy have been conducted using full gold standard methodology [5, 46, 85]. Data from one (reported across two publications) provides support for the Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale - Anxiety Items (EPDS-3A) and the Matthey Generic Mood Question (MGMQ) [5, 85]. However, insufficient information regarding screening tool accuracy was reported. Consequently, while this study can be used to support the inclusion of the EPDS-3-A and the MGMQ in future evaluations, it cannot be used to draw firm conclusions regarding their accuracy. Further, our own study of postpartum people, some, albeit weak, support for the EPDS-3-A and the General Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7) was found [46].\nAlthough existing studies' findings do help to select tools deserving of further investigation, they fall far short of identifying an accurate and reliable, much less an optimal, screening tool for perinatal AD. Despite an urgent public health need, to date, no accurate perinatal AD screening tools have been identified. The proposed research aims to fill this gap.\nObjectives\nThe core objective of this research is to identify one or more accurate screening tools to detect perinatal AD. To this end, we will:\n1. Assess the accuracy of a range of screening tools for perinatal AD as a whole and individually. Specifically, we will report the full composite of screening tool metrics for each evaluated measure: 2. at each assessment point (prenatal and postpartum);3. for the core DSM-5 anxiety disorders alone, and including OCD and PTSD;4. for each of the individual AD; and\n1. across parity (parity = 0, parity [greater than or equal to] 1) and major ethnic groups.\n2. Based on the above, we will report the most accurate screening tool for the AD as a group, and for each individual AD.\nSecondary and exploratory study objectives:\n1. Document the prevalence of perinatal AD in pregnancy and the postpartum. As this study requires an unselected/representative sample of perinatal people from within a specified geographical region, it provides the opportunity for us to document prevalence.\n2. Explore relationships between participant demographic characteristics (e.g., age, relationship status, race/ethnicity, household income, income needs, education, employment status, geographical area of residence), identity (gender, sexual orientation), experiences with discrimination (e.g., race, social class, religion, weight/body size, chronic illness, history of substance use), and sleep with AD.\n3. Assess perinatal people's experience with mental health assessment and treatment seeking and utilization. Among participants who reported symptoms meeting criteria for one or more AD, we will assess assessment and treatment seeking as well as any barriers experienced (e.g., cost, location, race or culture, time, etc.). Among those who received an assessment or treatment, we will ask about the nature, duration, and costs associated with any assessments or treatment received, as well as diagnoses obtained, and practitioner type.\n4. Assess the relationship between unpaid domestic labour (i.e., household chores and childcare responsibilities) and mental health and relationship satisfaction. Specifically, we will assess the overall burden (i.e., quantity), perceptions of fairness, and gender distribution of unpaid domestic labour with respect to mental health and relationship satisfaction prenatally and postpartum.",
        "methodology": "Methods\nA large, prospective cohort of pregnant people (N = 1,000) is being recruited proportionally across health service delivery regions in British Columbia (BC). The screening accuracy of a broad range of perinatal AD self-report measures are being assessed using gold standard methodology. Consenting individuals are administered online questionnaires followed by a semi-structured diagnostic interview between 16- and 36-weeks' gestation, and again between 6 and 20 weeks postpartum. Questionnaires include all screening measures, measures of sleep and unpaid family work, and questions pertaining to demographic and reproductive history, COVID-19, gender role burden, and mental health treatment utilization. Interviews assess all current anxiety disorders, as well as obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThe current study employs a prospective cohort design.\nInclusion criteria\nAll pregnant individuals, living in the province of British Columbia (BC), over the age of 18 and able to speak and read English at a level sufficient to complete the study questionnaires and interviews are eligible to participate in this research.\nRecruitment\nWe are employing a range of recruitment approaches with an emphasis on internet-based strategies, specifically, paid social media advertisements utilized for general population recruitment throughout the province. This method is supplemented with unpaid internet-based community recruitment to target rural, diverse, and marginalized communities. This entails the posting of study advertisements and posters on our lab social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) and other online settings frequented by pregnant people in BC (e.g., pregnancy-related blogs, Facebook or Instagram pages, and websites).\nDiverse sample recruitment is being carried out via partnerships with midwifery clinics, family physicians' and obstetricians' offices, and community centres and other community organizations. This recruitment consists of an introductory phone call or email to the agency, followed by an email including study information, study pamphlet, and posters to print or share with clients and the community. This form of recruitment is used to focus efforts on collecting a diverse, proportionally representative sample of the birthing population in the province and allows us to target additional populations that would otherwise not be reached through social media.\nSample representativeness\nTo achieve a sampling frame that is 80-90% representative of the population of English-speaking birthing people in BC, participants are being recruited proportionately across BC's five Health Authorities. To further enhance sample representativeness, sample characteristics (e.g., age, parity, education, geographical area) are tracked and compared to the BC perinatal database population data for the timeframe of recruitment. As needed, enhanced recruitment and sample weighting will be used to adjust for differences. All recruitment materials are inclusive of minorities and gender-diverse people.\nSample size estimation\nApproximately 44,000 residents of BC give birth each year [86]. We are seeking a sample of 1,000 participants for each of the two study time points. This will provide 80% power to detect AUC for ROC curves [greater than or equal to] 0.56 as significantly different from 0.5, at a significance level = 0.05; 88% power to detect sensitivity [greater than or equal to] 0.60 as > than 0.5; and > 99% power to detect specificity [greater than or equal to] 0.60 as > 0.5. We will be able to estimate the prevalence of low prevalence conditions (e.g., 3%) with 1.5% margin of error and 95% confidence. Of note, we will have 80% power to detect AUC [greater than or equal to] 0.65; 80% power to detect sensitivity [greater than or equal to] 0.72; and 99% power to detect specificity [greater than or equal to] 0.72. Allowing for an anticipated attrition of 15%, we are seeking to recruit 1,200 participants. To have 80% power to detect sensitivity [greater than or equal to] 0.7; and 99% power to detect specificity [greater than or equal to] 0.6 for the individual AD, we will need [greater than or equal to] 30 participants per AD in this sample.\nEthics\nEthics approvals\nApproval for this study has been granted by the University of British Columbia's Behavioural Research Ethics Board (#H20-01277).\nEthical and safety considerations\nAt the start and end of each questionnaire, all participants are provided with a list of pregnancy and postpartum-related resources in their community. During study interviews, any participant who reports clinically significant symptoms, or symptoms meeting diagnostic criteria for one or more AD, are provided a list of treatment services in their community, as well as individualized referral suggestions from the study interviewer.\nIf it is determined that a participant is suffering from suicidal ideation, additional steps are taken to ensure participant safety. If a participant endorses suicidal ideation during the completion of the online questionnaire (i.e., answers 'Yes, quite often,' or 'Sometimes,' to: \"The thought of harming myself has occurred to me.\") on the measure administered to assess depressed mood (i.e., the Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale) [43], an additional risk assessment questionnaire then probes for suicidal behaviour. If a participant is deemed to have elevated risk for suicidal behaviour, the study team is alerted, and the participant is contacted via phone by a trained team member within 24 hours. If no contact is made, a follow up email is sent to maximize earliest participant contact. If suicidal ideation is identified during a study interview, the interviewer takes the necessary steps to ensure the participant's safety. Management of suicidal ideation is based on the study safety and emergency mental health protocol.\nIn the event of a perinatal loss, participants are contacted by a member of the study team to express support, and perinatal loss specific resources are provided if desired with the option for additional support or resources at a later time, if needed. Only data provided prior to a perinatal loss will be retained in the data set (e.g., in the event that a loss occurs following the completion of the prenatal questionnaires and interview, data will be retained).\nData collection and storage\nStudy questionnaires are completed online via REDCap [87, 88], and study interviews are administered by telephone or Zoom video conferencing [89].\nConsent\nConsent for this project is provided electronically at the time of enrollment. Interested individuals are able to access the study intake form from advertisements and are able to follow links to the consent form and eligibility questionnaire. Upon providing consent, participants are then able to download and save a PDF copy of the consent form for their personal records. By consenting to participate, participants are also consenting to complete the study interviews. Participants are informed of limits to confidentiality (i.e., urgent risk of harm to oneself, or harm coming to a child) in the consent form and at the beginning of each interview.\nConsent for recording the interviews (for the purpose of assessing inter-rater reliability) is requested verbally at the beginning of each interview.\nParticipant communication\nPersonal, identifying information (e.g., name, first three digits of postal code, telephone) is acquired via the study intake form and stored in REDCap. For the duration of participation in the study, first name and email address of the participants remained connected in REDCap along with a unique ID code in order to send participants questionnaire links, reminders, and other communication throughout participation in the study.\nProtection of participant information\nOnce data collection is complete, all data will be downloaded and stored on a secure, password-protected University of Victoria computer server, and subsequently deleted from the REDCap server. At that time, all identifying participant information will be removed from the study data files, and data will be identified only by a unique ID code only. Participant contact information, along with ID codes, will be stored on a separate, password protected file to retain participant information for future contact and potential follow up surveys.\nProcedures\nFollowing study enrollment, participants are administered questionnaires and an interview at two time points: once prenatally and once postpartum. Each assessment consists of online questionnaires and a semi-structured diagnostic interview. Participants are emailed a link to the questionnaires which they complete online. Prenatal questionnaires are completed between 16- and 32-weeks' gestation. Postpartum questionnaires are completed between 6 and 16 weeks postpartum. All interviews are conducted over the phone or by video conference, 2-6 weeks after the completion of the questionnaires. See Fig. 1 for diagram of participant flow through the study.\nFig. 1:\nParticipant flow\nAssessment tools\nSee Table 1 for a summary of study measures.\nTable 1:\nSummary of study measures\nDiagnostic interviews\nDiagnostic Assessment Research Tool (DART) [90]\nThe DART is a psychometrically sound, semi-structured diagnostic interview designed to assess of a wide range of mental health conditions within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th edition - Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) mental health conditions, including all the anxiety and anxiety-related disorders [90]. The DART includes mandatory, criterion-based questions and optional questions that may be necessary for clarification in order to make a diagnosis. Psychometric testing of the DART demonstrates excellent construct validity and good convergent and discriminant validity, and high interrater reliability [91]. The DART is used in this study to assess: (a) all DSM-5-TR anxiety disorders, (b) OCD, (c) PTSD, as well as (d) disorder age of onset and relation to reproduction. To assess perinatal AD specifically, the DART interview has been tailored to include perinatal specific examples (e.g., fear of childbirth, perinatal-related obsessions, birth trauma).\nInterview training\nOur team has extensive experience training students to administer diagnostic interviews to perinatal research participants. All study interviewers are trained to a strict criterion. Specifically, they are required to match the supervising interviewer: (a) on the primary diagnosis, and (b) to within [+ or -] 0.5 severity point, on two successive interviews to be permitted to interview independently. Study interviewers are also trained in special considerations in the assessment of perinatal AD, and the assessment of perinatal specific symptoms of the AD (e.g., worries about the baby, fear of childbirth). Study interviewers are closely supervised throughout the study.\nQuestionnaires\nAnxiety disorder screening measures\nScreening tools were selected based on two key criteria:\n1. Evidence of accuracy: Measures which have been found in prior research, of reasonable methodological quality, to demonstrate some evidence of diagnostic accuracy (i.e., minimally an AUC [greater than or equal to] . 70, and a Youden's index of [greater than or equal to] 0.4), have been included.\n2. Conceptually relevant: Screening tools for which evidence of accuracy is not available but where the content is highly relevant have also been included.\nTo have the potential to be included based on screening accuracy, we required that the screening tool had been evaluated using sufficient quality methodology that the screening metrics could be deemed meaningful. Specifically, we required that the research assessed diagnostic accuracy in a perinatal population; employed some form of diagnostic assessment without knowledge of screening tool scores; assessed a minimum of three AD; and reported minimally AUC, and sensitivity and specificity for AD independently of other disorders. This represents a \"softer\" set of criteria than the full gold standard criteria, allowing us to determine which perinatal AD screening tools hold promise and should be further evaluated. Further, reported AUC values and J -Indices were required to meet or exceed 0.75, and 0.40, respectively.\nBased on these criteria, we identified eight measures for inclusion in the current study: the STAI [92], the EPDS-3A [93], the GAD-7 [94], the K-10/K-6 [95], the MGMQ [5], the Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale (PASS) [96], and the ANRQ-2A [97, 98]. Additional measures were assessed but performed too poorly to merit further evaluation: the KMMS [82] the EPDS [43], the GAD-2 [94], the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Anxiety (HADS-A) [99], the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire - Revised (PRAQ-R/R2) [100], and the Whooley [101]. Additional information about each measure is provided below.\nState Trait Anxiety Inventory--Trait (STAI-T) [102]\nThe STAI-T is a 20-item self-report measure. Participants are asked to indicate how they feel in general on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much so), in response to a variety of statement (e.g., \"I have been nervous\"). Scores less than 25 represent little to no anxiety, scores ranging from 26-40 represent moderate anxiety, scores over 40 represent high anxiety. The STAI-T has been used to assess clinical anxiety across many patient populations with a high Cronbach's alpha of 0.90 [102]. The STAI has shown acceptable test-retest across samples (0.73-0.86) [102].\nWe elected to include the STAI-T was based on the single study of N = 100 pregnant people [79]. In this study, 5 of 8 AD were assessed, and both the AUC value (0.89) and the J -index (0.61) were above the threshold for a \"good enough\" screening tool.\nEdinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale - 3 Anxiety Items (EPDS-3A) [43]\nThe EPDS is a 10-item self-report measure screening tool, and is the most widely used screening tool for postpartum depression [43]. Items are rated from 0-3 and assess symptom severity over the last week, with 0 indicating no symptoms, and 3 indicating more severe symptoms of depression. All 10 items are scored to provide a sum score, with higher scores indicative of more severe depressive symptoms. The EPDS has been included in the current study for two reasons: (a) to screen for depressed mood, and (b) to be evaluated as a screening tool for perinatal AD.\nScreening for depression\nA cut-off score of 13 identifies pregnant and postpartum people with severe depressive symptoms that should be assessed further by healthcare practitioners for a depression diagnosis (42). A review paper of the EPDS reported sensitivity estimates ranging from 64 to 100% for identifying depression, and specificity range from 73 to 97% across included studies (n = 11) [103]. Although the EPDS has presented with variable levels of sensitivity and specificity in the literature, it is a widely used tool in English-studies [104], and has also been highly acceptable across different cultures [103]. The EPDS has acceptable reliability and internal consistency (Cronbach alphas from 0.82--0.84) [105], and is a common screening tool for depression during both pregnancy and the postpartum [103, 105].\nScreening for perinatal AD\nThree items have been frequently found to cluster on an anxiety factor leading to the creation of an anxiety subscale, the EPDS-3A, which can be used to screen for perinatal anxiety [93, 106]. Studies have found the optimal cut-off score for anxiety to be 4 or above [107], or 6 or above [108]. When a cut-off of 4 has been used, the EPDS-3A has resulted in a sensitivity of 63%, and specificity of 70% for detecting any anxiety disorder [107]. Importantly, it has been found that women who score high on the anxiety subscale tend to score relatively low on the total EPDS, indicating that their anxiety may have gone undetected had the EPDS-3A was not specifically used [108].\nTo our knowledge, a total of five studies have assessed the accuracy of the EPDS-3A as a screening tool for perinatal AD [5, 46, 77, 80, 109]. Of these, the measure demonstrated sufficient accuracy as to provide support for inclusion in the current research [5, 46, 98]. In two of these studies, the EPDS-3A was assessed among pregnant people [5, 98]. In the first of these three (5), the screening accuracy of the EPDS-3A was assessed for six AD among N = 214 pregnant participants. In the second study [98], four AD were assessed in a sample of N = 954 pregnant people at approximately 34-weeks' gestation. The third study [46] to provide evidence of the screening accuracy of the EPDS-3A included assessments of all the AD, and involved N = 310 postpartum participants. All three studies employed DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. The two studies involving pregnant people resulted in AUCs of 0.82 and 0.81, and J -indices 0.42 and 0.54, respectively [5, 100]. The study involving postpartum people [46] resulted in an AUC of 0.76, and a J -index of 0.42. Neither of the remaining two studies to evaluate the EPDS-3A as a screening tool for perinatal AD [80, 109] resulted in screening metrics meeting required thresholds.\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7) [110]\nThe GAD-7 is a 7-item self-report measure designed to assess symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) [110]. Items are rated on a Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 (not at all), to 3 (nearly every day). The GAD-7 has been found to demonstrate good reliability as well as convergent, criterion, construct, factorial and procedural validity [110, 111]. The GAD-7 is sensitive to change over time [111], and has been validated for use in the perinatal period [77]. Prior research has found a Cronbach's alpha of 0.92 for the GAD-7 [110]. The GAD-2 is a shortened version of the GAD-7 comprised of the first two items, with these items selected to capture the core diagnostic features of GAD [94].\nInclusion of this measure was based on two studies: one previously conducted by our team (N = 310) [46], and a second more recent publication (N = 954) [98]. In the first of these [46], we assessed the screening accuracy of the GAD-7 for all AD as a group, against DSM-IV criteria, among postpartum people. This resulted in an AUC of 0.78 and a J -index of 0.41, exceeding our threshold for inclusion. The second study's [98] assessment of the screening accuracy of the GAD-7 was conducted in relation to five DSM-V AD (i.e., GAD, PD, AG, SAD and OCD) criteria. This resulted in an AUC of 0.82 and a J -Index of 0.51, also exceeding our threshold for inclusion. In the same study [98], the GAD-2 was also assessed for these disorders and resulted in even stronger screening metrics (i.e., an AUC of 0.83 and a J -Index of 0.52).\nKessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6/K10) [95]\nThe K10 is a self-report measure of psychological distress which can be administered as the full 10-item version (the K10) or the briefer, 6-item version (the K-6) [95]. The K6 is comprised of 6 items from the K10. Items are measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (none of the time), to 4, (all of the time). Total scores range from 0-24 for the K6, and 0-40 for the K10. Optimal cut-scores for the detection of DMS-IV mental health conditions have been suggested as 14 for the K6, and 24 for the K10 [112]. The K10/K6 has demonstrated consistently strong psychometric properties across a variety of sociodemographic samples [95], and the K6 has been found to have result in a sensitivity of 0.36 and a specificity of 0.96 in predicting serious mental illness in the general population [113].\nThe K10/K6 as a screening tool for perinatal AD has been evaluated in two studies [80, 81]. This resulted in two assessments of the K10 [80, 81], and one of the K6 [80]. The first assessment of the K10 as a screening tool for perinatal AD employed a representative sample of pregnant people (N = 129), and assessed 3 AD [81]. This evaluation resulted in AUC values of 0.71 and 0.76, and J -Indices of 0.48 and 0.75 (depending on the cut-score employed) [81]. The second study to evaluate the K10 as a screening tool for perinatal AD also employed a representative sample of pregnant people (N = 376), and included an assessment of all of the AD, resulting in an AUC of 0.77 and a J -Index of 0.46 [80]. This second study also included an assessment of the K6 which resulted in an AUC of 0.77 and a J -Index of 0.45.\nMatthey Generic Mood Question (MGMQ) [5]\nThe MGMQ screens for a range of negative emotional states including depression and anxiety [5]. It consists of three questions pertaining to how the individual has been feeling over the past two weeks [5]. The first question (distress question) is related to feeling stressed, anxious, or unhappy (response options of 'yes', 'possibly' or 'no'). If this initial question is endorsed, the individual is asked the two remaining questions: how bothered (bother question) they have been by these feelings (response options of 'not at all', 'a little bit', 'moderately', 'a lot'), and what they think has caused their distress. Although the MGMQ appears to demonstrate a good-excellent level of accuracy in screening for perinatal anxiety disorders [114] publications related to this measure have not included metrics necessary to draw this conclusion with confidence [5], nor have they consistently differentiated screening accuracy for depression from screening accuracy for anxiety [85].\nPerinatal Anxiety Screening Scale (PASS) [96]\nThe PASS [96] is a 31-item self-report measure designed to screen for perinatal anxiety. Participants are asked to indicate how often they have experienced a variety of emotions/sensations (e.g., worry about the future) over the last two weeks. Items are scored via a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all), to 4 (almost always). Scores in the 0-20 range represent little to no anxiety, scores ranging from 21-41 represent mild-moderate anxiety, and scores ranging from 42-91 represent severe anxiety.\nThe inclusion of the PASS in the current study was based on a study in which the PASS, when administered to pregnant participants (N = 312), demonstrated very high accuracy against both DSM-IV and the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria (i.e., AUC values of 0.93 and 0.94, and J -indices of 0.76 and 0.79, respectively) [83]. However, the strong screening metrics obtained in this study may be attributable to the fact that study interviews were administered prior to questionnaire completion. Administration of the study interview prior to questionnaire completion may have resulted in participants providing responses more similar to those provided in the interview than would have been the case had the questionnaire been completed first.\nAntenatal Risk Questionnaire - 2 Anxiety Items (ANRQ-2A) [97]\nThe ANRQ is a 12-item questionnaire that assesses a range of content domains (e.g., emotional support from respondent's own mother in childhood, history of mood disorder and treatment received, life stress) [97]. The ANRQ-2A is comprised of the two anxiety items from this measure, with higher scores indicating risk for perinatal mental health problems [95]. ANRQ scores have been shown to correlate with EPDS scores [115].\nThe ANRQ-2A was included based on a recent study of N = 954 people assessed in late pregnancy [98]. In this study, the accuracy of ANRQ-2A was assessed against DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. A cut-off of 6.0 on the ANRQ-2A resulted in an AUC of 0.84, and yielded a J -Index of 0.54 (in this case both sensitivity and specificity = 0.77), providing support for these items in routine screening [98].\nAnxiety Disorder--22 (AD-22) [116]\nThe AD-22 is a 22-item, self-report anxiety screening measure created for the current project [116]. Instructions, items, and scoring was adapted from a previous proof of principle screening accuracy assessment of 13 items (1-3 per disorder) taken from a variety of other self-report measure of specific anxiety conditions. The AD-22 measure includes items reflective of each of the core AD (i.e., PD, SAD, SP, GAD, AG, separation anxiety) as well as OCD and PTSD. Items were developed by our team of investigators. There are three items for each disorder with the exception of SP and AG for which there are two, respectively. Respondents are asked how bothered they have been by each of the 22 included symptoms/experiences of anxiety (e.g., difficulty controlling worry, feeling afraid of crowded spaces) over the previous two weeks. Items are rated on a Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely).\nThis measure has been included in the current study as the 13-item version exceeded the required accuracy of a \"good enough\" screening tool [46]. Specifically, data from this study of N = 310 postpartum people resulted in an AUC of 0.86 and a J -index of 0.54.\nPerinatal Anxiety Screening Questionnaire (PASQ) [117]\nThe PASQ is a newly constructed screening tool, created by our study team specifically for perinatal AD screening [117]. The PASQ screens for all core AD (PD, SAD, SP, GAD, AG, separation anxiety), as well as OCD and PTSD. The tool includes 8 primary \"yes/no\" questions to probe for the core feature of each AD (e.g., \"Do you worry a lot about many different things [e.g., your pregnancy or baby, parenting ability, family finances, work or school, or world events]?\"). For each AD, if the participant selects \"yes\" to the primary question, the next question for that AD section is asked. However, if the participant selects \"no\" to the primary question, they will move to the next AD section and will be asked a new \"yes/no\" primary question for a new AD. The PASQ has a total of 36 possible questions, and the number of questions for each AD section varies depending on the number needed to effectively address the core DSM-5 diagnostic criteria of each AD. There are 3 possible questions for SP, 6 for PTSD, 7 for OCD and the remaining AD sections (SAD, PD, AG, GAD, separation anxiety) all have 4 possible questions each. This tool was created for the current project to include examples and descriptions catered to new and expectant parents.\nAdditional measures\nInsomnia Severity Index (ISI)\nThe ISI is a 7-item, self-report measure of sleep difficulties experienced over the previous two weeks [118]. Items are rated on 0-4, Likert-type scales with 0 representing an absence of symptoms, and 4 representing severe symptoms. Items are summed to yield a total score, with higher scores representing more severe sleep difficulties. Scores between 15-21 indicate moderate insomnia, while scores over 22 indicate severe insomnia. In clinical samples, a cut-off of 15 has yielded a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 1.00 for detecting cases of insomnia [119]. Evidence of ISI validity has been demonstrated by moderate but significant correlations between ISI scores and both subjective (sleep diary) and objective (polysomnography) measures of sleep [119]. Similarly, the ISI has shown sustained sensitivity to changes in sleep difficulties over time, with total scores being paralleled by sleep diary data, polysomnography and clinician evaluation [118]. This measure has shown excellent internal consistency in clinical and community samples (Cronbach alphas from 0.73--0.91), and has been deemed a reliable tool to measure insomnia severity [118, 119].\nFamily Work Quality Questionnaire (FWQQ)\nThe FWQQ, developed by Janzen and Hellsten [120] is a 28-item self-report measure of unpaid family work. This measure assesses five subscales of unpaid work quality: demands (time pressure and differing demands); equity (fairness in the division of unpaid work); autonomy (freedom over types of work conducted and decision); social resources (assistance from family and friends); caregiving reward (gratification received from responsibilities). Items within each subscale are rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree), to 4 (strongly agree). The scale has shown adequate internal consistency, with Cronbach alphas ranging from 0.75-0.88 [120].\nLab based measures\nQuestions pertaining to participant demographic information, identity, experiences, reproductive history, current pregnancy and birth, childcare distribution, relationship and sexual satisfaction, postpartum mental health service utilization and covid-19 were developed by our research team and included in the study questionnaires. Much of this content has been used before in previous studies [46, 121, 122].\nDemographic information\nOur team has well-established questions pertaining to participant demographic information which we have used in multiple studies [46, 121, 122]. Demographic characteristics assessed include age, relationship status, race/ethnicity, household income, income needs, education, employment status, geographical area of residence.\nIdentity\nQuestions to better understand participants' identity, including sex assigned at birth, gender, pronouns, sexual orientation, belonging to a minority community have been included. Additionally, participants are asked if they have experienced discrimination during their medical care due to their identity or an experience (e.g., race, social class, religion, weight/body size, chronic illness, history of substance use).\nReproductive, pregnancy and birthing information\nOur team has well-established questions pertaining to participant reproductive history, current/most recent pregnancy, and birth [46, 121, 122]. Information collected includes parity, delivery, number of children (biological, non-biological), reproductive loss, conception, birth plan, mode and location of delivery, birth weight, neonatal health, infant feeding, infant sleep arrangement.\nDomestic labour\nWe are also collecting information pertaining to domestic labour. Questions ask about the participant's parenting/living situation, parental leave, childcare, share of care of children and share of domestic responsibilities.\nSatisfaction\nRelationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and irritation and/or anger with the division of childcare and domestic chores were each asked about via a single question. Relationship satisfaction was rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from \"Very dissatisfied\" to \"Very satisfied.\" For sexual satisfaction, participants are asked to select a response ranging from \"Dissatisfied\" to \"Satisfied,\" with an additional option to select \"I choose not to answer.\" The irritation and/or anger with the division of childcare and domestic chores was rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \"Not at all\" to \"Extremely.\"\nPostpartum mental health\nIn the postpartum questionnaire, participants are asked to provide information regarding their engagement with mental health services. Specifically, they are asked if they have sought any mental health assessment(s) since their prenatal interview with us. If an assessment for mental health difficulties was sought, they are then asked if they experienced any barriers (e.g., cost, location, race or culture, time, etc.). If they received an assessment, they are asked additional questions about diagnosis and treatment (e.g., which, if any diagnoses were assigned, what, if any, treatment(s) they are receiving, how this treatment is funded and what practitioner provides this treatment if applicable).\nCOVID-19\nNine questions created by our research team regarding COVID-19 are included to assess the impact of the pandemic on participants' experience of anxiety. Participants are asked questions relating to their experience and concerns related to COVID-19 (e.g., \"How concerned are you about the potential impact of COVID-19 on your childbirth experience?\"; \"How much of an impact is COVID-19 currently having on your ability to receive support care for your children?\"). Participants are asked to select a response ranging from \"Not at all\" to \"Extremely.\"\nCurrent status\nRecruitment, data collection and study interviews are currently underway and are set to finish in January 2025. To date, we have recruited approximately 60% of our sample, with 783 participants enrolled. Of the 727 enrolled, 316 of these have fully completed their participation in the study.",
        "analysis": "Data analysis plan\nDescriptive statistics\nDescriptive information will be presented as means, standard deviations, percentages, and 95% confidence intervals. The diagnostic accuracy of screening tools will be assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses within the prevalence sample. AUC values, derived from the ROC curves, represent overall diagnostic accuracy, and will be reported with 95% confidence intervals. Optimal cut-off values for each measure will be determined from ROC analyses and based on maximizing Youden's J index value (see screening tool metrics above). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, LR [+ or -] , and percent correct classification will also be reported. We will also determine the cut-point associated with 0.75 sensitivity and calculate the corresponding J index and specificity (prevalence sample). We will estimate sensitivity and specificity of each of the screening tools for the individual AD.\nResearch objectives\nAUC will be compared among all pairwise combinations of tools using DeLong's method for paired ROC curves [123] and using a false-discovery-rate correction (FDR, with family-wise alpha = 0.05) for p -values [124] to account for multiple testing. Sensitivity and specificity will be compared across all tools using McNemar's test for paired categorical data, with FDR correction for multiple testing [124].\nWe will report the full composite of the screening tool metrics (i.e., AUC, J index, PPV, NPV, LR + , and LR-) for each of the measures assessed. Screening metrics will be reported for the core AD with and without PTSD and OCD, as well as separately for major ethnic and parity groups (i.e., parity = 0, and parity [greater than or equal to] 1). We will recommend screening tools based on their accuracy (i.e., scores on the above metrics) and implementation feasibility (i.e., length, administration time, scoring time and complexity, and cost, if any). To ensure the screening tools are not missing any individual AD by analyzing them together, we will also estimate sensitivity and specificity for each AD by comparing those who report symptoms meeting criteria for one specific AD with those whose symptoms fail to meet criteria for any AD.\nAdditional analysis\nWe will use log-binomial models to evaluate the relative risk of AD with respect to important demographic and reproductive variables (e.g., age, and parity), COVID-19 related concerns, and gender role burden (e.g., time spent in childcare and domestic tasks). We will evaluate these variables as risk factors for AD development and exacerbation. In the unlikely event that none of the assessed screening tools meets the standard of a sufficiently accurate measure, data from the first assessment will be used to empirically derive a new measure. This would involve exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, followed by logistic regression and prediction modelling, using the screening tool items from the first assessment as training, and the second assessment as testing and validation.\nSoftware\nData management and analyses described above will be conducted using R [125] and Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) (Version 25) [126].",

        "discussion": "Discussion\nThis research is in response to an urgent demand for accurate perinatal AD screening tools based on high quality evidence. AD among perinatal people often go unidentified and untreated, resulting in continued suffering and life impairment. Findings from this research will inform healthcare providers, policymakers, and scientists, about the most effective approach to screening for anxiety and related disorders in pregnancy in the postpartum period.\nKeywords: Anxiety disorders, Perinatal anxiety, Screening, Assessment, Pregnancy, Postpartum\nAuthor(s): Nichole Fairbrother1 , Bryn Stagg2 , Olivia Scoten3 , Cora Keeney1 and Claudia Cargnelli2\nDiscussion\nIt is now evident that perinatal AD are highly prevalent (1 in 5 perinatal people), impairing, distressing with potential negative effects for the developing fetus and infant [15-17]. Detection, prevention, and treatment are highly important to mitigating these consequences. Accurate and reliable screening is a critical first step to identifying those at risk of, or currently suffering from, these disorders. Despite calls for implementation [62, 64], perinatal AD screening is rarely conducted. This is in large part because the current published literature fails to provide sufficient empirical support for any instrument. Although much research evaluating perinatal AD screening tools has been conducted, it has been hampered by methodological shortcomings of such magnitude that no available screening tool can justifiably be recommended for widespread implementation.\nFor these reasons we have undertaken a large-scale study of the accuracy of a broad range of potential perinatal AD screening tools. Our objective is to identify, employing gold standard methodology, one or more accurate and reliable measures. We have sought to overcome the methodological shortcomings of previous research so that our findings can be justifiably used to make practice and policy decisions. Population-based administration of screening tools is expensive to implement and is unlikely to be undertaken without strong evidence that the screening tool(s) employed will in fact correctly identify those experiencing the disorders being screened for.\nTo our knowledge, this will be the first study in which all gold standard methodology has been employed. Specifically, in this research:\n1. all of the core anxiety disorders and additional anxiety-related disorders are assessed;\n2. gold standard, diagnostic interviews are administered;\n3. diagnostic assessments are conducted blind to screening tool results;\n4. DSM-5 diagnostic criteria are employed;\n5. an unselected/representative sample of pregnant and postpartum people is being sought;\n6. screening accuracy is assessed in both pregnancy and the postpartum; and\n7. diagnostic interviews are administered within two to six weeks of completion of screening tools.\nThe study includes a number of additional methodological strengths. Specifically, the study is powered to ensure we can assess the accuracy of included screening tools both for the AD as a whole, but also for each individual AD. Our approach to recruitment is designed to result in data for 1,000 pregnant and 1,000 postpartum people. We are over-sampling, where needed, perinatal people with specific AD so that we are able to report on screening accuracy for each of the individual AD.\nBeyond the core goal of this research (i.e., to assess the accuracy of various self-report measures when used as screening tools for perinatal AD), we have the opportunity to explore a number of additional research questions. For example, because this research is based on DSM-5 anxiety and related disorders, we are also able to explore screening for separation anxiety disorder. To our knowledge, no findings related to screening for adult separation anxiety among perinatal people have been published. In addition to providing information about screening accuracy for adult separation anxiety disorder, we will also be able to provide the first estimate of the prevalence and incidence of this condition among perinatal people. Further, we will document the point prevalence and postpartum incidence of perinatal AD in pregnancy and the postpartum. To our knowledge, perinatal AD prevalence, based on DSM-5 criteria has yet to be reported. Further, we will be able to assess the extent to which participants who report symptoms meeting criteria for one or more AD go on to receive an assessment and treatment for these conditions. We will also assess various predictors (e.g., demographic, reproductive, identity, experience of discrimination) of perinatal AD symptoms and diagnosis, as well as assessment and treatment access and utilization. Finally, we will assess the relationship between the burden and gender distribution of unpaid domestic labour (i.e., household chores and childcare responsibilities) and mental health.\nFindings from this research will provide rich data to answer not only our core research questions but additional, important questions pertaining to perinatal AD.\nAbbreviations: AD: Anxiety and anxiety-related disorders; AG: Agoraphobia; AUC: Area under the curve; BC: British Columbia; COPE: Australian clinical practice; DSM-5: Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders; LR: Likelihood ratio; NPV: Negative predictive value; OCD: Obsessive-compulsive disorder; PPV: Positive predictive value; PTSD: Posttraumatic stress disorder; PD: Panic disorder; ROC: Receiver operating characteristic; SP: Specific phobia; SAD: Social anxiety disorder; GAD: Generalized anxiety disorder\nAcknowledgements: We would like to express our immense gratitude to our study participants who generously contributed their time to this research.

        "introduction": "Stimulus equivalence is a behavioral phenomenon that has been related to complex human behavior (e.g., remembering, cognitive functioning, and symbolic behavior). As a rule, people diagnosed with severe mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) that exhibit delusional and hallucinatory behavior, and disorganized speech have shown cognitive impairment (e.g., processing speed, reasoning/problem solving). Not enough research has analyzed the stimulus equivalence performance in this population. This study aims to investigate the stimulus equivalence performance in adults diagnosed with severe mental disorders. In particular, this study analyzes the many-to-one (MTO) and one-to-many (OTM) training structures effects, and the simultaneous (SIM) and the simple-to-complex (STC) training and testing protocol effects on equivalence class formation in this population. To achieve it, we analyzed the behavior of 18 participants diagnosed with severe mental disorders in three different conditions (Condition 1 OTM/SIM; 2 MTO/SIM; and 3 MTO/STC). Behavior consistent with stimulus equivalence was found in 11 out of 13 participants who had finished the study (5 participants decided to leave before completing the tasks). STC yielded better results than the SIM protocol. No differences were found between MTO and OTM training structures. Implications and suggestions for further research have been discussed.\nKeywords Stimulus equivalence ? Training structures * Training protocols * Severe mental disorders * Severe behavioral problems\nSchizophrenia, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and some types of dementia are diagnostic labels under the umbrella of severe mental disorders. People diagnosed with this type of psychological problem usually exhibit delusional and hallucinatory behavior, disorganized speech, and cognitive impairment (e.g., verbal memory, processing speed, reasoning/ problem solving, symbol coding; Bedi et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2013; Mota et al., 2012; Zaninotto et al., 2015). These behaviors typically affect multiple areas of adaptive functioning (e.g., daily life activities, self-care behaviors, job performance; Marcus & Cather, 2016; Strassnig & Harvey, 2019). Diagnostic labels are developed from a biomedical model of psychological problems that imply that these behaviors are symptoms of an underlying biological problem (Deacon & McKay, 2015). However, these biological theories of psychological problems failed to elucidate the biological basis of these diagnostic labels (Frances & Nardo, 2013), people diagnosed with the same problem engage in different behavioral problems (Deacon, 2013), and the diagnostic does not allow for planning a successful intervention (Wilder, 2009). A behavioral analytic account of severe behavioral problems (1) related to these diagnostics does not imply a common underlying biological or mental problem, and is centered on analyzing environmental variables of which these behaviors are function. Also, this type of analysis suggests, among other characteristics (seeFerreira et al., 2021; Madden et al., 2016); an idiographic study of these problematic behaviors, a functional-analysis based intervention, and the use of experimental behavior analytic findings to understand and develop behavioral programs for these serious behavioral problems (Cautilli, 2018; Iwata & Dozier, 2008). Our study may contribute to this discussion by examining how experimental parameters affect complex behaviors in people with schizophrenia and other severe mental disorders.\nWithin behavior analysis, complex human behaviors such as remembering, cognitive functioning, and symbolic behaviors have been related to stimulus equivalence phenomenon (Palmer, 1991; Wilkinson & Mcllvane, 2001) and have been studied by using conditional discrimination procedures (Brogard-Antonsen & Arntzen, 2020; Steingrimsdottir & Arntzen, 2014). Stimulus equivalence is a behavioral phenomenon defined by the emergence of untrained (i.e., novel) behaviors after a specific baseline training (Sidman, 2009; Sidman & Tailby, 1982). As a rule, conditional discrimination techniques are used during training to teach a set of interrelated baseline relations (e.g., AB, BC, and CD). After that baseline training, participants are tested to respond to untrained relations (e.g., A = A, known as reflexivity; B = A, symmetry; and A = D, transitivity). Stated in more precise language, a set of N stimuli arranged in N-l baseline trained relations can produce the emergence of N2-N +1 untrained relations (Fields et al., 2020). If an individual performs according to reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity during the testing trials, it is said that they have formed classes of equivalent stimuli and, therefore, they have performed in accordance with stimulus equivalence (Sidman & Tailby, 1982).\nThis type of research paradigm has been useful to study complex human behavior performance. For example, stimulus equivalence has been analyzed in children diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities; adults without mental diagnostics; patients with dementia and Alzheimer's; and elderly people (Arntzen, 2012). Data yielded by these experiments are useful for expanding the basic knowledge about conditions that allow individuals to show performance characterized as stimulus equivalence (e.g., participant characteristics, training structures, testing protocols) and thus for the elfective arrangement of stimulus equivalence procedures in behavioral programs (e.g.,Bolanos et al., 2020; Giannakakos et al., 2021; Mullen et al., 2017; Steingrimsdottir & Arntzen, 2015). Adults diagnosed with serious mental illness can benefit from this experimental and applied behavior analysis. However, to our knowledge, only one study (Gonzalez Pando et al., 2016) has analyzed the stimulus equivalence class formation in patients diagnosed with severe mental illness.\nGonzalez Pando et al. (2016) conducted a preliminary experimental study to analyze the equivalence class performance in adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. In this experiment, they arranged a training for the emergence of two 3-member equivalence classes of abstract stimuli. They trained four baseline relations (AIB 1, A2B2, B1C1, and B2c2) to eight inpatients from a public mental health hospital using matching to sample procedures. The training structure used was a linear series structure (e.g., training AB baseline relations first and BC baseline relations then), and they used a simple-to-complex protocol (STC), to test for the emergence of novel relations (e.g., Fienup et al., 2015). In the STC, training of AB relations is followed by the test for the symmetrical relations (BA); the second baseline relation (BC) is then trained, followed by the test for the emergence of symmetrical relations (CB), transitive relations (AC), and equivalence relations (CA). After the baseline training, half of the participants showed a performance according to stimulus equivalence during testing probes. This study represents one of the first attempts to experimentally study the equivalence class performance in adults diagnosed with schizophrenia; however, it has some experimental flaws. They used a mastery criterion of > 70% correct responding during training and testing. This mastery criterion is not rigorous enough and it does not allow experimenters to confirm that the equivalence classes were formed. Another flaw of this experiment is the number of participants and the high rate of experimental withdrawal; they started the experiment with eight participants and just four of them finished the experimental tasks. These flaws severely limit the interpretation of the results. But, despite the flaws of this experimental study Gonzalez Pando et al. have proved the capability of some members of this population to show the emergence of untrained relations and have opened the way for further experimental analysis and the possibility to add equivalence-based instructions to the clinician treatment tools of this population.\nMoreover, the study of other derived relations with this clinical population is also scarce (Hendriks et al., 2020). There are pilot experiments dedicated to assessing the already established deictic relational responding in adults diagnosed with schizophrenia (Villatte et al., 2010) and adults who present psychosis-related problems (McEnteggart et al., 2017), and to study the differences between hearing-voices individuals and a control group using the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP; McKenna et al., 2007).\nThe study of stimulus equivalence and derived relations in people diagnosed with severe mental illness is a promising area of research that needs further investigation. Studying the performance of this population on stimulus matching tasks and analyzing the variables that could improve their performance could help us to improve behavioral interventions for these specific problems. In both basic and applied research on stimulus equivalence formation, an extensive literature is available regarding different procedural variables (e.g., training structures, training protocols, number of classes and/or members, simultaneous and delayed matching to sample) that could enhance the stimulus class formation (cf., Arntzen, 2012). For instance, three training structures have traditionally been used to train the baseline relations: linear series (LS; e.g., training AB and BC baseline relations), many-to-one (MTO; e.g., training BA and CA baseline relations), and one-to-many (OTM; e.g., training AB and AC baseline relations). Several empirical studies have been conducted to grasp how the training structures affect the results of equivalence (e.g.,Ayres-Pereira & Arntzen, 2021; Fields & Moss, 2007; Smeets & Barnes-Holmes, 2005). In general, the LS training structure is considered the least effective in establishing equivalence classes; although there is still an ongoing debate about the main differential effects of MTO and OTM to improve the performance of equivalence class formation (Arntzen, 2012). Another procedural variable that interacts with the effects of different training structures is the training protocol (i.e., how the training and testing trials are sequenced; Fields et al., 1997; Imam, 2006). Two of the most studied training protocols are the simultaneous protocol (SIM) and the simple-to-complex protocol (STC; e.g., Fienup et al., 2015). Both protocols have proved their efficacy in establishing equivalence classes among different populations. However, as previously stated, there is a lack of experimental evidence on stimulus equivalence in people diagnosed with severe mental illness. Therefore, experiments devoted to analyzing how these procedural variables affect performance in equivalence classes could expand this experimental literature and stimulate further research.\nThe general purpose of this study was to assess the equivalence class performance of adults diagnosed with severe behavioral problems and variables that could improve their performance. In particular, the main purpose of this article was to analyze the MTO and OTM effects and the SIM and STC effects on equivalence class formation in individuals diagnosed with severe mental illness. To achieve it, we analyzed equivalence class formation in this population (i.e., people diagnosed with severe mental disorders who present severe behavioral problems such as delusions, hallucinations, and impairments in cognitive functioning) by comparing (1) the effects of OTM and many-toone (MTO) in equivalence performance and (2) comparing the effects of simultaneous training protocol (SIM) and simple-tocomplex testing protocol (STC). This experiment would replicate the results and solve some experimental flaws of Gonzalez Pando et al. (2016) study by using a stricter learning criterion and using three stimulus comparisons rather than two (Arntzen, 2012). Also, it would be useful to know more about the effect of different training structures, and training and testing protocols on the performance of people with severe behavioral problems.",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants\nEighteen adults diagnosed with severe mental disorders accepted to participate in this study. Once they were accepted, they were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions. The age, sex, diagnostic label, and education level of each participant were registered (we have labeled as \"high educational level\" the participants who have received a university degree, \"middle educational level\" for high school graduate or other professional certifications, and \"low educational level\" for elementary school; see Table 1). All participants were recruited from the same public-funded work rehabilitation center (WRC) based in Spain; in this center, they receive psychological treatment, occupational therapy, and pharmacological treatment under the supervision of a mental health system. The first contact with participants was made by the center's psychologist or clinical director. Once they agreed to participate, the first author explained and read with them the consent form. They were informed of their rights to withdraw at any time without penalty; none of them presented problems understanding the consent form's details, and no participant needed nor had a legally authorized representative or similar legal figures. None of the participants reported having experience in this type of experimental procedure. At the end of the experiment, the first author debriefed the experimental task with the participants. Two ethics committees (i.e., WRC and UAM's ethics committees) have approved this experiment's procedures. All current COVID-19 restrictions were followed.\nEquipment and Setting\nThe experiment was carried out in a quiet and small room (5 m * 2.5 m) inside the work rehabilitation center. The room was equipped with a table (2 m x 1 m), two chairs, and a laptop in which the tasks were conducted. Also, according to the COVID-19 measures, a pump bottle dispenser of hand sanitizer gel was available for the participant at any time. The windows were partially open, and the keyboard was cleaned after and before each participant.\nThe stimuli, behavioral recording, and instructions were presented using PsychoPyl, an open-source software package (Peirce et al., 2019). The participants were asked to use the keyboard to advance during the experiment and select the stimuli during the MTS procedures. We scheduled one session per participant, each session lasted no more than 180 min, and participants were instructed to ask for a break whenever they wanted it. No participant asked for a break and sessions lasted no longer than 85 min, but some participants decided to withdraw (see Results section for further details).\nStimuli\nStimuli consisted of nine abstract shapes (see Fig. 1). These stimuli had no meaning for the Spanish verbal community of our participants. The classes of equivalent stimuli to form were randomly made before the experiment, so there was no preexperimental relation between the stimuli; nevertheless, it was measured during the pretest phase of the procedure.\nDesign\nWe used a single-subject pretest/posttest design (Sidman, 1971) with three different conditions, each replicated with six participants. In all conditions, participants trained six baseline relations using a simultaneous matching-to-sample (SMTS) procedure and were tested for the emergence of six symmetry relations and six transitivity relations (i.e., we expected 12 relations to emerge to confirm the equivalence class formation). Moreover, we manipulated three procedural variables to produce each experimental condition (see Table 2). In Condition 1, participants trained the baseline relations BA and CA, using an MTO training structure, and were tested for the emergence of symmetry and equivalence relations (i.e., AB, AC, BC, and CB) using a SIM testing protocol. In Condition 2, participants trained the baseline relations AB and AC, using an OTM training structure, and were tested for the emergence of symmetry and equivalence (i.e., BA, CA, AB, CB) using a SIM testing protocol. Finally, in Condition 3, we used the MTO training structure with a simple-to-complex (STC) protocol. Conditions 1 and 2 served to compare training structures (MTO and OTM) effects under a SIM protocol. Conditions 2 and 3 served to compare testing protocols (SIM and STC) effects under an MTO training structure.\nProcedure\nTrial Structure\nEach trial consisted of a matching-to-sample procedure in which an observing response to the sample was required. The sample stimuli appeared in the upper part of the screen. The participants were asked to press the up key of the keyboard when the sample was on the screen (i.e., observing response). This was followed by the presentation of three comparisons in the right, center, and left part of the screen. The participants selected these stimuli using the keyboard's right, low, and left keys. During the baseline training, a correct selection by the participant was followed by the presentation of the written words \"Yes\" and \"Perfect\" colored in green. If participants made a wrong selection during the training, the word \"No\" appeared on the screen colored in red. These words were in the center of the screen for 1.5 s and followed by a blank screen for 500 ms.\nPretest\nThe pretest evaluated if participants would respond according to equivalence before training. In this phase, first, participants read the following instruction printed on the screen (translated from Spanish): \"When you see a figure at the top of the screen, please, press the up key. After three figures appear on the screen, please, select one of them with the correspondent right, low, and left keys.\" Then, participants were exposed to a block of 54 trials without any differential consequences after each selection. During this phase of the procedure, all relations between stimuli were presented randomly. If one participant scored more than 18 correct trials (approximately 33% of correct responses), they would be removed from the experiment.\nBaseline Training\nIn this phase, the following instruction was presented on the screen (translated from Spanish): \"Now you have to learn how to respond correctly to the symbols. We are going to deliver you feedback after each choice.\" This phase consisted in establishing the baseline relations on each condition (see Table 3). For example, during this phase, participants in Condition 1 were trained to establish six stimulus relations: AB relations (e.g., A1B1, A2B2, and A3B3) were established using matching-to-sample trials (i.e., A1/BTB2B3, A2/B1B2B3, and A3/B1B2B3: the line under the stimulus indicates experimenter-defined comparisons) and AC relations (i.e., A1C1, A2C2, and A3C3) were established using matching to sample trials (i.e., A1/C1C2C3, A2/C1C2C3, and C3/C1C2C2). The baseline training followed the same logic on all the training phases shown in Table 3. The OTM training structure was used in Condition 1; and MTO training structure in Conditions 2 and 3. The mastery criteria in this phase for all conditions was 12 consecutive correct responses.\nBaseline and Emergent Relations Tests\nAfter mastering the baseline relations, participants were tested for the emergence of three 3-member equivalence classes. Before starting this phase, the following instruction was presented on the screen (translated from Spanish): \"Now, please, choose accordingly to what you previously learned.\" This phase consisted of testing (i.e., without consequences) emergent relations between stimuli.\nFor example, six trained baseline relations (i.e., A1B1, A2B2, A3B3, A1C1, A2C2, and A3C3); six untrained symmetry relations (i.e., B1A1, B2A2, B3A3, C1A1, C2A2, and C3A3); and 6 untrained equivalence relations (i.e., B1C1, B2C2, B3C3, C1B1, C2B2, and C3B3) were tested during the mixed testing of the Condition 1 (see Table 3). The simultaneous testing protocol was used with Conditions 1 and 2; a simple-to-complex (STC) testing protocol was used with the participants of Condition 3 (see Table 3). The mastery criteria for these tests were > 90% of correct responses. If a participant did not meet the mastery criteria in one of the test blocks, the task ran until all trials were presented (e.g., 54 trials during the mixed testing), and they were exposed to another training phase. Condition 3 participants that did not meet the mastery criteria during the mixed testing (i.e., (SYM) AB, AC) were exposed again to the mixed training phase (i.e., B1A1, B2A2, B3A3, C1A1, C2A2, C3A3). Also, if a participant did not meet the mastery criteria after three training-testing cycles, the experimental session ended.",
        "analysis": "Response Measurement and Data Analysis\nWe registered the number of correct responses and incorrect responses (according to the stimulus classes presented in Fig. 1) during training phases; the number of trials to meet the required criteria per participant in each phase; and response speed (i.e., 1/reaction time; Whelan, 2008). Pretest and testing phase performances of each participant were categorized as \"Passed\" or \"Failed\" based on the mastery criteria required for each phase (see Table 3).",
        "results": "Results\nOverall, 61,11% of participants have formed equivalence classes (i.e., 11/18; Condition 1 = 3/6, Condition 2 = 3/6, and Condition 3 = 5/6); 27,7% of participants have withdrawn during the experiment (i.e., 5/18; Condition 1 =3/6, Condition 2= 1/6, and Condition 3 = 1/6); and 11% of participants have not formed equivalence classes (i.e., 2/18; Condition 1 =0/6, Condition 2 = 2/6, and Condition 3 = 0/6; see Fig. 2). Moreover, no participant met the exclusion criterion in the pretest phase.\nPerformance during Training Trials\nTables 4, 5, and 6 show each participant's performance per condition. Table 4 displays the performance of Condition 1 (OTM-SIM) participants and the time that they spent during the experimental tasks. This condition generated more withdrawals than all other conditions, 50% compared to the 16,6% in the other conditions. On average, participants in this condition needed more time to finish the experiment (Condition 1 M = 57.8, M = 13.2; Condition 2 M = 42.5, SD= 18.09; Condition 3 M = 34.6; SD= 10.27). Also, Condition 1 participants needed more trials to learn baseline relations, but that difference could be explained by the performance of P1004 (see Fig. 3).\nHigh variability can be found in Condition 1 (OTM-SIM) and Condition 2 (MTO-SIM) participants' performance. In general, Condition 3 (MTO-STC) participants' performance is more stable than in the other conditions (see Fig. 3). For example, Conditions 1 and 2 have shown more differences between participants and more differences between trials needed to learn the first and second baseline relations. On the other hand, Condition 3 participants have shown a similar number of trials to learn baseline relations, and they needed an equal number of trials to learn each baseline relation.\nPerformance during Tests\nIn general, Condition 3 (MTO-STC) has had higher yields in emergence probes than the other experimental conditions (see Fig. 4). Moreover, Conditions 1 and 2 had more incorrect responses than Condition 3.\nDifferences between the number of correct and incorrect responses during probe trials between conditions could be explained by the static nature of the SIM testing protocol. Using this protocol, participants of Conditions 1 and 2 have been exposed to the same number of probes (BSL, SYM, and EQ; 18 trials each per testing phase). However, the simple-to-complex testing protocol yields a different number of probes because they were presented according to the performance of each individual (see Fig. 5).\nMoreover, Fig. 3 shows that most participants who finished the procedure and passed the equivalence test (8/11) tended to learn the second set of baseline relations in fewer trials or with as many trials as the first set. On the other hand, most participants who failed the test or withdrew (4/7) tended to require more trials to learn the second set of baseline relations. These results suggest that the difficulty in acquiring the baseline may have been the cause of failure and dropout. Conditions 1 and 2 generated the same number of withdrawals and/or failures. Therefore, the training structure does not seem to have been a factor in the negative results. Condition 3 generated fewer withdrawals and/or failures. Therefore, the results indicate that the SIM protocol may be a factor for failure in the test and withdrawal.\nResponse Speed\nIn general, there is no difference in response speed between conditions. However, we found a faster response in the correct responses (see Fig. 6). Although the response speed mean during the first trained baseline for Condition 1 (OTM-SIM) is superior to the other conditions, this difference could be explained by participant PI004 performance during that phase. P1004 response speed mean was 3.4 s and the mean of the rest of the participants was 0.61 (SD=0.175; see supplementary material for detailed plots of individual performances).\nParticipant Variables\nFigure 7 displays the performance of our participants regarding two participant variables that have not been manipulated during the study. High and middle educational levels showed better performance than low educational level participants. Those participants showed more percentage of withdrawal than the other educational level. Finally, we have found no differences in the performance of our participants regarding diagnostic labels.",
        "limitations": "Limitations and Further Research\nThis study would be strengthened using a different sampling method. Here we included all participants who wanted to participate from a labor rehabilitation center. Future research could use more elaborated sampling methods to control possible biased results. Another limitation of this study was the lack of experimental control of individuals' pharmacological treatment; they all continued their treatment as usual. This lack of experimental control prevents us from knowing more about pharmacological treatments' interaction with stimulus equivalence phenomena. Future studies could be conducted to measure this potential interaction. Another limitation is the lack of additional measurements of potential motivational variables that could affect the performance of our participants. Gathering more information about the participants' status would be useful for further research. For instance, our results could be interpreted as an empirical demonstration that this population did not show any deficits in verbal fluency and symbol coding, which could affect equivalence class formation. We encourage to avoid such interpretations because we did not have control and we didn't have any additional measure. Thus, further studies could increase the number of participants, expand the analysis of stimulus equivalence behavioral phenomena with more classes and members, perform longitudinal studies to analyze this behavior unfolding in time, control the educational level of participants, add aditional measures and analyze the usefulness EBI to teach this clinical population new skills.\nSummary\nWe have analyzed the stimulus equivalence performance of 18 participants diagnosed with severe mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and major depression). Responses according to stimulus equivalence were found in 11 out of 13 participants who had finished the study (5 participants decided to leave before completing the tasks). STC testing protocol yielded better results than the SIM protocol. No differences were found between training structures. Further research focused on the differential effect of these testing protocols could expand the knowledge about stimulus equivalence research in this clinical population. Also, novel studies could study the effect of pharmacological treatment on stimulus equivalence performance and develop EBI in adults with severe behavioral problems.\nFunding Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.

        "discussion": "Discussion\nThis study aimed to analyze the stimulus equivalence class formation performance in adults with severe behavioral problems. We wanted to know if this population could perform according to stimulus equivalence with more strict mastery criteria and increase the number of participants in comparison with previous research (e.g., Gonzalez Pando et al., 2016). Also, we wanted to explore the effects of different training structures and testing protocols in this clinical population.\nGeneral Performance\nThis experiment adds more evidence about the capability of people diagnosed with severe mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder) to behave according with stimulus equivalence: 11 out of 13 participants who finished the experiment formed stimulus equivalence classes. In other words, in general participants responded successfully to untrained conditions based on what they had learned during the baseline training. These results are congruent with previous research in stimulus equivalence (e.g., Gonzalez Pando et al., 2016) and research in derived relations (e.g., O'Neill & Weil, 2014). The work by O'Neill and Weil entails similarities to the protocols used to establish conditional discrimination and the formation of equivalence classes. They wanted to generate deictic relational responding in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. After a baseline training of I-You, Here-There, and Now-Then (as in Weil et al., 2011), all participants (i.e., three adults diagnosed with schizophrenia) increased their performance during trained deictic relational responding, and all participants showed generalization of these responses in novel perspective-taking tasks.\nAlso, as in previous experiments, we found a high rate of experimental withdrawal; 5 out of 18 participants decided to leave the experiment before finishing the experimental tasks. We found higher withdrawal rates among participants with a lower level of education, and there was no distinction between different diagnostic labels. This could mean that higher levels of education could establish a learning history that could improve the performance during this type of task. However, this conclusion needs to be addressed in further experimental studies.\nOTM and MTO Conditions (Condition 1 vs. Condition 2)\nExperimental Conditions 1 and 2 were trained using different training structures (one-to-many and many-to-one, respectively). There is little difference between the performance yielded from both conditions (as in Arntzen & Hansen, 2011; Smeets & Barnes-Holmes, 2005); three participants out of six have responded according to stimulus equivalence in both conditions. OTM condition has indeed yielded a higher rate of participant withdrawal. Still, this difference is not conclusive given the low number of participants in each condition. We can not claim that the OTM training structure yields more withdrawal than MTO in this clinical population. The same is true for the number of trials required to learn baseline relations and the response speed results. The main differences were found in the behavior of just one participant (i.e., P1004); therefore, we cannot claim any essential difference between these two conditions.\nSIM and STC Conditions (Condition 2 vs. Condition 3)\nExperimental Conditions 2 and 3 have involved the use of SIM and STC testing protocols, respectively. It is important to note that both conditions were trained with the same MTO structure. STC testing protocol yielded more responses according to stimulus equivalence than the SIM protocol. Also, participants in the STC condition needed fewer trials to learn baseline relations. Also, the STC testing protocol produced fewer incorrect responses than the SIM protocol. This could explain differences in the withdrawal/failure rates between conditions. SCT training protocol (Condition 3) yielded less withdrawal/failure rate than the other conditions with SIM testing protocol (Conditions 1 and 2). These results are in line with previous research found in other populations (e.g., Fienup et al., 2015) and suggest that effective teaching involves the mastery of simple prerequisite behaviors before developing larger repertoires (Skinner, 1968).\nImplications for Applied Research\nThe present study contributes to the knowledge about individuals diagnosed with severe mental disorders. This study replicates previous research and confirms that people diagnosed with these types of problems can establish novel stimulus equivalence. Also, this study may have opened the door to the use of EBI with people with severe behavioral disorders by providing new experimental data of the training structures and protocols in this population. Although more research is needed to confirm that the STC testing protocol is more efficient than the SIM protocol, the STC testing protocol could be of use when working with this clinical population. These results align with previous research that has indicated that STC protocol stabilized individual differences, yielded better results, and was more efficient (e.g., Fienup et al., 2015). In addition, this paradigm of research can be useful to measure this clinical population's cognitive functioning (e.g., remembering tasks using experimentally established classes). It could be interesting analyzing how this performance varies with, for example, more training or under novel circumstances (e.g., under new pharmacological treatment). Finally, we would like to highlight that we did not find any difference between severe mental disorders' diagnostics: stimulus equivalence performance was a function of procedure variables (i.e., testing protocols), and previous individual learning history (i.e., educational level). This emphasizes the future significance of an idiographic approach to the assessment and treatment of this clinical population.",

        "introduction": "A straightforward approach to establishing that a stimulus functions as a punisher is to superimpose a single-alternative punishment schedule on a concurrent schedule of reinforcement with equal scheduled reinforcement on the two alternatives. If the stimulus acts as a punisher, there should be a shift in preference away from the punished alternative and toward the unpunished alternative. We replicated this experiment with the Procedure for Rapidly Establishing Steady-State Behavior (PRESS-B) using point-loss as the punisher. Twenty-four participants worked on sets of three concurrent random-interval random-interval (cone RI RI) schedules of reinforcement: one with no punishment (\"baseline\" condition) and two with punishment where an RI schedule of punishment was superimposed on one of the alternatives. Compared to their respective baseline conditions, all punished conditions showed a decreased median proportion of time allocated to the punished alternative. This successful replication supports the use of point-loss punishment in PRESS-B, which means that researchers can use the procedure to further study the effects of punishment on human operant behavior.\nKeywords Operant behavior * Random-interval schedules ? Punishment\nThe Procedure for Rapidly Establishing Steady-State Behavior (PRESS-B; Klapes et al., 2020) is a rapid-acquisition operant procedure for human continuous choice in the laboratory. In PRESS-B, participants are exposed to a range of concurrent random-interval random-interval (cone RI RI) schedules of reinforcement using a Findley (1958) switching-key arrangement. Presses on a standard keyboard's spacebar (i.e., responses) result in the accumulation of points (i.e., reinforcers). PRESS-B utilizes aspects of previous human-operant continuous choice laboratory procedures, such as very rich reinforcement schedules (Popa, 2013) and a specific discriminative stimulus for each schedule (e.g., Bradshaw et al., 1976; Horne & Lowe, 1993), to produce high-quality continuous choice data in a short period of time. In particular, Klapes et al. (2020) were able to expose participants to nine cone RI RI schedules in under 35 min, whereas traditional human operant laboratory procedures (e.g., those based on Madden & Perone's, 1999, procedure) necessitate weeks of participant burden to acquire the same amount of viable data. An experimental aspect of interest that is still missing from PRESS-B, however, is the implementation of punishment.\nPunishment can be incorporated into PRESS-B by making point loss contingent on pressing the spacebar, superimposed on the reinforcement schedules maintaining the same response. To test this implementation, we replicated a common concurrent experimental design to show that a stimulus can be appropriately defined as a punisher (e.g., Critchfield et al., 2003; Kuroda et al., 2019; McDowell & Klapes, 2019). First, the participants were exposed to a cone RI RI reinforcement schedule holding equal RI values across the two alternatives (i.e., a \"baseline\" condition). Then, a RI punishment schedule was superimposed on only one of the alternatives (i.e., a \"punished\" condition). If the stimulus is a punisher, then--by definition (Azrin & Holz, 1966; Skinner, 1953/2005)--responses to the punished alternative should decrease during the punished condition; thus, in a concurrent experiment, preference for the punished alternative should decrease in the punished condition. The density of punishment (i.e., more or fewer punishers) should moderate this effect (Critchfield et al., 2003; McDowell & Klapes, 2019). The current experiment attempted to replicate these findings.",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants\nWe recruited Emory University undergraduate students via the same online recruitment system that was used by Popa (2013), Klapes et al. (2020), and Klapes et al. (2021). Participants self-reported their age, gender, race/ethnicity, and parental/guardian educational attainment (a proxy measure for socioeconomic status) prior to participating in the experiment. These studies were an option to satisfy an introductory psychology course requirement.\nWe enrolled 24 participants in the study. Participants were 50% female and 50% male. They had a median age of 19 years. The distribution of the participants' race was 21% Asian, 17% Black, 8% Latino/a/x, 46% White, and 8% other. The participants' parental/guardian educational attainment was slightly above a bachelor's degree (median parent/ guardian's years of education was 17 years).\nInformed Consent\nParticipants were informed of the general principles, risks, benefits, and methods of the study before participation. In addition, they were informed that they could retract consent at any time. We then asked participants to sign a consentto-participate form.\nMaterials\nExperimental sessions were conducted in two identical rooms. Both rooms were lit with fluorescent bulbs and the doors were closed for the duration of the experiment. Each room had an off-the-shelf Windows-based computer that was dedicated to running the experimental software. Operant behaviors were recorded via the computers' keyboards.\nWe used the same experimental software as was used by Klapes et al. (2021), with modifications for the delivery of punishers. The display had response and change-over buttons in the center, visual reinforcement and punishment stimuli on the sides, and an odometer-style counter for the accumulated point total. The color of the central button functioned as discriminative stimuli for the active alternative of the schedule. The delivery of a reinforcer simultaneously produced a point accrual on the odometer-style counter, the visual reinforcement stimulus (a flash of the green box to the left of the response button), and an auditory stimulus (a \"ding\" sound). The delivery of a punisher simultaneously produced a point deduction on the odometer-style counter, the visual punishment stimulus (a flash of the red box to the right of the response button), and a different auditory stimulus (a \"womp\" sound). The concomitant delivery of reinforcement and punishment (i.e., a reinforcer and punisher were both baited for the participant's spacebar press) produced both visual stimuli, but no change to the odometerstyle counter and no auditory stimulus.\nProcedure\nParticipants attended a single session. At the end of the session, there was a debriefing period during which the participant was told about the study's purpose and given an opportunity to ask questions. At the start of the session, the researcher read aloud instructions to the participant; these instructions were the same as those used by Klapes et al. (2021), with three additions related to the implementation of punishment (viz., \"you can earn or lose points by pressing the space bar on the keyboard,\" \"the rate at which you gain or lose points is different depending on whether the button is blue or yellow,\" and \"every time that you lose a point, the red light to the right of the center button will flash and a 'womp' will sound.\").\nDuring the experiment, participants worked on nine sets of concurrent reinforcement schedules with equal RI values in the two components (see Table 1). Each concurrent schedule was presented for 200 s. We used a 0.5-s changeover delay, based on Klapes et al.'s (2021) results for optimal PRESS-B data retention and quality. Brief blackout periods between the schedules were implemented by forcing the participants to take a 5-s break after each schedule presentation. The nine cone RIRI schedules were presented as three distinct blocks of varying reinforcement density, namely, cone RI 1-s RI 1-s, cone RI 4-s RI 4-s, and cone RI 7-s RI 7-s. Thus, the reinforcement density blocks represented three separate replications for each participant.\nThe first schedule of each reinforcement density block always served as a baseline condition (i.e., no superimposed punishment). For the second schedule in each set, a RI punishment that scheduled either half as many (P50; i.e., fewer scheduled punishers) or 80% as many (P80; i.e., more scheduled punishers) punishers than scheduled reinforcers was randomly assigned to and superimposed on one of the alternatives. The other punishment schedule was then presented on the same alternative for the third schedule in the block. The order of reinforcement density block presentation was randomized across participants. In addition, punishment was superimposed on the first alternative for the first- and last-presented blocks and the second alternative for the middle-presented block (i.e., alternating the \"punished alternative\" between reinforcement density blocks) for half of the participants, whereas punishment was superimposed on the second alternative for the first- and last-presented blocks and the first alternative for the middle-presented block for the other half of participants.",
        "analysis": "",
        "results": "Results\nAs reported by Klapes et al. (2022), there was a coding error in the procedure's program that resulted in the program reporting response rates that were approximately double that of the \"true\" response rate emitted by the participants. However, there was no issue in recording and reporting the timing of changeovers between the two alternatives. Thus, following Klapes et al.'s recommendation, we only focused our analysis on time spent on each alternative. The order of experimental schedule presentations, the time spent on each alternative, and obtained reinforcement and obtained punishment rates per min for each participant on each schedule can be found in the associated supplemental material.\nOur primary outcome variable was the proportion of time allocated to the punished alternative,\np([T.sub.punished] = ([T.sub.punished])/([T.sub.punished] + [T.sub.unpunished]),\nwhere [T.sub.punished] was the time spent on the punished alternative and [T.sub.unpunished] was the time spent on the unpunished alternative. p([T.sub.punished]) values less than 0.5 indicated a shift away from the punished alternative, whereas values greater than 0.5 indicated a shift toward the punished alternative. The median p([T.sub.punished]) across participants is plotted for each experimental schedule in Fig. 1. Under each reinforcement density block in the figure, we included the percentage of participants that exhibited a decreased p([T.sub.punished]) in the P50 and P80 conditions compared to the respective baseline condition. Participant 422 exhibited exclusive preference for the subsequently unpunished alternative during the baseline condition of the cone RI 1-s RI 1-s reinforcement density block, making a decrease in p([T.sub.punished]) during the punishment conditions compared to baseline impossible. Thus, this participant was excluded from the percentage calculation for the RI 1-s RI 1-s reinforcement density block. All punishment conditions had lower p([T.sub.punished]) medians compared to indifference (i.e., 0.50; dashed line in Fig. 1) and compared to their respective baseline conditions. Further, all P80 conditions had lower p([T.sub.punished]) medians compared to the P50 condition for the same reinforcement density block.\nWe used Wilcoxon (1945) signed-rank tests to assess differences in median p([T.sub.punished]) values between the experimental conditions for each reinforcement density block. For the cone RI 1-s RI 1-s reinforcement density block, there was a significantly lower p([T.sub.punished]) median for the P50, T = 276, p < .001, r = -0.85, and P80, T = 276, p < .001, r = -0.85, punishment conditions compared to baseline. Further, 17 (70.8%) of the 24 participants exhibited a lower p([T.sub.punished]) *n P80 condition than the P50 condition; this reduction was significant, 7=218, p = .023, r = -0.50. The cone RI 4-s RI 4-s reinforcement density block also showed a significantly lower p([T.sub.punished]) median for the P50, T = 284, p < .001, r = -0.78, and P80, T = 295, p < .001, r = -0.85, punishment conditions compared to baseline. Only 14 (58.3%) of the 24 participants exhibited a lower p([T.sub.punished]) in P80 condition than the P50 condition, with no significant difference between the two conditions, T - 176, p = .302, r = -0.15. Similar to the other two reinforcement density blocks, the RI 7-s RI 7-s reinforcement density block also showed a significantly lower p([T.sub.punished]) median for the P50, T = 289, p < .001, r = -0.81, and P80, T = 276, p < .001, r = -0.73, punishment conditions compared to baseline. Fifteen (54.2%) of the 24 participants exhibited a lower p([T.sub.punished]) in P80 condition than the P50 condition, with no significant difference between the two conditions, T = 159, p = .386, r = -0.05.",

        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe current study represents a successful main result generated by single-alternative RI punishment superimposed on equivalent cone RI RI reinforcement schedules. In particular, point-loss as a punisher in PRESS-B resulted in the expected shift away from the punished alternative and toward the unpunished alternative for most participants across the three reinforcement density block replications. Every punishment condition had a significantly lower median p([T.sub.punished]) compared to the respective baseline condition.\nAll participants exhibited decreased p([T.sub.punished]) in both punishment conditions compared to baseline during the cone RI 1-s RI 1-s reinforcement density block, but not in the other two reinforcement density blocks. Further, the cone RI 1-s RI 1-s reinforcement density block was the only block to display the expected modulating effect of punishment density (i.e., more punishers resulted in a greater shift away from the punished alternative). These results suggest that point-loss punishment in PRESS-B works best when implemented with very rich reinforcement schedules, like those seen in previous PRESS-B studies (Klapes et al., 2020; Klapes et al., 2021). Visual inspection of Figure 1 supports this hypothesis; the cone RI 1-s RI 1-s reinforcement density block displays a much greater suppressive punishment effect than the other blocks. It should be noted that reinforcement and punishment densities were inherently confounded (i.e., the strongest punishment schedule was superimposed on the richest reinforcement schedules whereas the weakest punishment schedule was superimposed on the leanest reinforcement schedules). That is, the richer punishment rate may be the true cause of the consistently larger decrease in p([T.sub.punished]) compared to baseline and substantially lower median p([T.sub.punished])for the conc RI 1-s RI 1-s reinforcement density block relative to the other reinforcement density blocks.\nThe results of this experiment indicate that the point-loss implementation of punishment allows for the PRESS-B to effectively produce continuous choice under superimposed punishing contingencies. Regarding future directions, PRESS-B should be considered a viable tool for researchers interested in furthering the study of punishment's effect on human operant behavior (Fontes & Shahan, 2021). Future studies that could utilize PRESS-B towards this end include, but are not limited to, the implementation of conc RI RI reinforcement schedules with superimposed conc RI RI schedules of punishment to enable the testing of new quantitative punishment models for continuous choice (Klapes et al., 2018) and the development of quantitative models for resurgence under both reinforcing and punishing contingencies (Fontes et al., 2018).\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1007/s40732-023-00541-5.\nData Availability All data generated and analyzed during this study are included in this manuscript and its supplementary information file.\nDeclarations\nEthical Approval Study approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Emory University.

        "introduction": "Background\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications have been associated with mental health services utilization and medication consumption, there is no longitudinal study on the long-term impact on ADHD medication use trends.\nBackground\nA steady growth in the use of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications has been reported for the decades prior to the COVID-19 pandemic [5, 16, 23]. This was associated with an increase in the general awareness of ADHD among the public, practitioners, and psychotherapists alike. An important contributing factor was the broadening of the diagnostic criteria, e.g., the elimination of exclusion criteria such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the DSM-5 released in 2013 [1]. Also, DSM-5 reduced the symptoms threshold for adults and the necessity of a childhood onset for an adult-ADHD diagnosis has become a matter of debate [4, 18]. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a break in this steady growth: We showed in a previous study that, globally, ADHD medicine consumption in 2020 was on average per country 6% lower than predicted based on pre-pandemic data [12]. However, several studies reported adverse effects of the pandemic on patients with ADHD in form of increased ADHD symptoms [6, 24, 25]. In fact, towards the end of 2021, the actual consumption slightly exceeded the predicted consumption without the occurrence of the pandemic [12]. Recent studies reported that the pandemic led to greater stress in children with ADHD in general [11], as well as medium-term impacts on children with ADHD of pandemic-related stress specifically [26]. Pre-pandemic studies found prolonged effects of stress exposure in form of worsened and persistent ADHD symptoms from childhood into young adulthood [14, 15]. Because no studies to date have investigated ADHD medication consumption in Europe after COVID-19, this study aimed to assess the long-term impact of the pandemic in the European ADHD medication market, particulary answering the question if the post-pandemic surge is only a catch-up effect or if the pandemic has indeed accelerated consumption growth in the long run. We examined changes in ADHD medicine consumption trends from pre-pandemic (2014 to 2019) to post-pandemic (2021 to 2022) in 28 European countries. We also measured the deviation of the actual consumption in 2022 from the prediction under non-pandemic conditions.",
        "methodology": "Methods\nThis study examines the European ADHD medication consumption in 2020 to 2022 compared to the predicted consumption assuming the persistence of pre-pandemic trends. Predictions are calculated using Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models.\nMethods\nData sources\nWe used quarterly data obtained from IQVIA Multinational Integrated Data Analysis System (IQVIA MIDAS[R]). IQVIA MIDAS data combine country-level data, healthcare expertise and therapeutic knowledge in 90 + countries to deliver data in globally standardized forms to facilitate multi-country analyses.\nThe database includes the sales of generic and brand products and does not contain individual-level data. Thus, institutional review board approval was not required. This study is based on sales volume data of ADHD medications from Quarter 1, 2014 to Quarter 4, 2022 of 28 European countries including information about the number of sold standard units, the strength, the active substances, and the sales value of each drug. Some of the substances included in the data set are also approved for other indications than ADHD treatment. However, in this study only sales data of medications specifically indicated for the treatment of ADHD (ATC class N06B) were evaluated.\nPopulation estimates of each country were obtained from the UN World Population Prospects 2022 report [28]. Definitions of the defined daily dose (DDD), which is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults [29] were obtained by the World Health Organization (WHO) for each substance.",
        "analysis": "Data analysis\nAs we do not observe the quantity of interest, consumption, directly, we use the sales data as proxy. It is plausible to assume that the error margin of medicine that is sold, but not consumed, remains fairly stable across regions and time, and does not distort the spatial and temporal analysis. We chose DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day as the main quantity of interest. Although individual doses vary, this number strongly correlates with the prevalence of diagnosed patients. Using the country-level sales volume data, the measure 'DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day' was calculated as following: [formula omitted]where standard.units are the number of sold standard units of each medication, strength is the dose of its active substance, DDD is the defined daily dose depending on the substance, population is the population estimate of the country at the time of sales and #days is the number of days in the time period. This measure is useful for comparison as it is standardized not only by time but also by population size.\nWe analyzed the European ADHD medicine consumption usage before and after the pandemic (2014 to 2022), per country and in total. Pre- and post-pandemic time trend coefficients were estimated by linear regression models using consumption data in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day from 2014 to 2019 (pre-pandemic) and from 2021 to 2022 (post-pandemic) including an intercept, time of sales (linear trend) and quarters as regressors. The year 2020 was left out in the regression analyses to avoid distortions. We tested, for Europe in total and for each country, the one-sided hypothesis that the post-pandemic trend coefficient is not larger than the pre-pandemic trend coefficient. Rejection of this one-sided hypothesis provides evidence for a post-pandemic increase of the trend. Details on the test are given in the Supplement.\nAdditionally, we analyzed the differences in active substances of ADHD medication. They can be divided into stimulants (amfetamine, dexmethylphenidate, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate), which are recommended as first-line pharmacological treatment, and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and guanfacine), which are recommended for patients who cannot tolerate stimulants, do not benefit from them or who suffer from substance use disorders [9, 19]. The effects can last 3-5 h (short-acting) or 8-12 h (long-acting).\nTo further quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ADHD medicine consumption, we forecasted the sales volume of the years 2020 to 2022 based on the national consumption trends until 2019. The impact was assessed by fitting a SARIMA model [10] and comparing its predictions to the actual sales volume. We used R [22], version 4.1.3, for data analysis.",
        "results": "Results\nWhile European ADHD medication sales recorded a drop in 2020, they returned to the predicted level in 2021, even slightly exceeding it. In 2022, we found a clear exceedance of the predicted level by 16.4% on average at country level. Furthermore, the increase in consumption growth in the post-pandemic period (2021-2022) compared to the pre-pandemic period (2014-2019) was significant in 26 of the 28 European countries under consideration.\nResults\nIncreased growth of European ADHD medicine consumption after the pandemic\nBefore the pandemic, the annual ADHD medicine consumption growth in Europe was consistently around 5 to 6% (Table 1). However, from 2018 to 2019, we observed a higher increase of 9.7%, which decreased from 2019 to the pandemic affected year 2020 to 4.7%. In the following years, we observed remarkably higher growth rates of 12.7% in 2021 and 15.2% in 2022.\nTable 1:\nAnnual ADHD medicine consumption and percentage change in Europe, 2014-22. DDD = defined daily dose\nComparing ADHD medication consumption by active substances (Table 2), we found increasing trends in all substances. Stimulants (methylphenidate, amfetamine, lisdexamfetamine or dexamfetamine) are by far the most frequently prescribed medications, followed by non-stimulants (atomoxetine or guanfacine). Methylphenidate has the highest share of the European consumption, however, due to rapid growth of lisdexamfetamine medications, its share decreases steadily (Fig. 1). We also found that consumption of long-acting medications increased stronger than prescriptions of short-acting medications, which accounted for 21% of total European consumption in 2014, but for only 15% in 2022 (Table 3).\nTable 2:\nAnnual ADHD medicine consumption by substance in Europe, in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day. DDD = defined daily dose\nFig. 1:\nShare of substances on European ADHD medication consumption. DDD = defined daily dose\nTable 3:\nAnnual ADHD medicine consumption by duration of action in Europe, in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day. DDD = defined daily dose\nIn line with previous studies, we found substantial differences in national ADHD medication use levels in 2019, ranging from 0.009 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in Bulgaria to 16.49 in Sweden. In general, the highest levels of medicine consumption were recorded in Scandinavian countries (Sweden, Norway, and Denmark), followed by the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Finland (Figure S2 in the Supplement). Eastern European countries generally showed the lowest consumption levels. However, time trends were comparable across most European countries. In the pre-pandemic years up to 2019, time trend estimates were significant at the 5% level in all countries except Romania and Luxembourg. In the post-pandemic period (2021 to 2022), regression slope estimates were significantly positive in all 28 countries. Moreover, post-pandemic time trend estimates were larger than pre-pandemic in all countries (Table 4; see also Figure S3 in the Supplement). In Luxembourg, and Romania, the consumption trend even switched from declining into increasing during the pandemic. In 26 of the 28 countries, the regression slopes after the pandemic (2021 to 2022) were significantly larger than before the pandemic (2014 to 2019). Non-significant increases were observed in Belgium and Croatia (Table 4). Throughout Europe (Fig. 2), the pre-pandemic regression slope was estimated as 0.03 (p < 0.001), increasing to 0.11 (p < 0.001) in the post-pandemic period. The latter is significantly larger than the former (p < 0.001). The individual-country analogues of Fig. 2 can be found the Supplement (Figure S2).\nTable 4:\nEstimated parameters by linear regressions, and t-test p -values testing post-pandemic < = pre-pandemic\nFig. 2:\nQuarterly ADHD consumption in Europe. Regression line in pre COVID years (2014-2019) is marked as red line, in post COVID years (2021-2022) as green line. DDD = defined daily dose\nConsumption of ADHD medicines exceeds predictions after COVID\nFor each country and for Europe in total, we calculated the difference between the actual ADHD medication consumption for the period from 2020 to 2022 and the predicted consumption under non-pandemic conditions. Towards this end, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models of order [1])x [1])4 were fitted using the maximum-likelihood method to the quarterly consumption during 2014 Q1 to 2019 Q4. Based on the thus fitted models, quarterly forecasts for the consumption levels in 2020, 2021, and 2022 were obtained. Hence, the pre-pandemic trends in national ADHD medicine consumption were extrapolated under the assumption of unchanged conditions, i.e., without the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, see Fig. 3.\nFig. 3:\nPredicted and actual global quarterly consumption of ADHD medication. DDD = defined daily dose\nIn the first year of the pandemic, we found lower consumption than predicted in most of the European countries. Twenty of the 28 European countries recorded a drop of ADHD medication consumption in 2020 (Table 5; Fig. 4). The highest losses were in Romania, Portugal, and Italy. Only in three countries (Latvia, Greece, and the Netherlands) did consumption substantially exceed the predictions. In Europe, ADHD medicine consumption amounted to 2.64 instead of the predicted 2.71 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, which corresponds to a relative loss of 2.34%. On country average, the national ADHD consumption in 2020 was 4.8% lower than predicted.\nTable 5:\nActual and predicted annual ADHD medicine consumption and relative difference per country in Europe\nFig. 4:\nPercentage difference of actual and predicted ADHD medication consumption in 28 European countries in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in 2020, 2021 and 2022. DDD = defined daily dose\nIn 2021, ADHD medication consumption in European countries on average returned back to the predicted level (Table 5; Fig. 4). While ten countries still recorded lower actual sales than forecasted, the remaining 18 countries met or even exceeded predictions. On average, the actual national ADHD medicine sales in 2021 were 0.98% above their predictions. Highest losses were recorded in Romania, Slovakia, and Italy, whereas Latvia, Greece, and the Netherlands again surpassed predictions the most. Throughout Europe, the actual consumption in 2021 (2.98 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day) was 2.65% higher than predicted (2.90 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day).\nIn 2022 however, medication usage levels were not only close to pre-pandemic predictions, but clearly exceeded them (Table 5; Fig. 4). In 23 of the 28 countries, the actual ADHD medication consumption was higher than predicted; in ten countries consumption surpassed predictions by more than 20%. The average relative deviation revealed a mean exceedance of national consumption forecasts by 16.4% in 2022. Only in five countries ADHD medicine sales were below the predictions. Belgium (-9%), Slovakia (-6%), the Czech Republic (-4%), Romania (-16%), and Italy (-6%). These countries were also among those most negatively impacted in 2020 and 2021.\nThroughout Europe, the consumption in 2022 was predicted as 3.08 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day without the emergence of COVID-19, whereas the actual consumption amounted to 3.43 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, which corresponds to an increase of 11.5%.\nComparing the mean national (unweighted averages) relative differences per quarter (Fig. 5), we found remarkably high exceedances of the predictions in the last three quarters of 2022. While in the first quarter of 2022, the actual consumption levels were on average 7% above forecast, which is about the same extent as the last quarter in 2021, consumption in the second and the third quarters surpasses the pre-pandemic trends by 18.7% and 17.3%, respectively. In Quarter 4 of 2022, the actual consumptions were on average even 23.3% higher than predicted, which contradicts the assumption of the increased ADHD medication use being only a catch-up effect of 2020.\nFig. 5:\nMean relative difference between actual and predicted ADHD medicine consumption (in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day) per quarter, 2020-2022.

        "limitations": "Conclusion\nThere is strong evidence of a trend change in the ADHD medicine consumption growth throughout Europe after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nKeywords: ADHD, COVID19, Pandemic, Pharmacoepidemiology, Time series forecasting\nAuthor(s): Sophie Gimbach1,2 , Daniel Vogel1 , Roland Fried2 , Stephen V. Faraone3 , Tobias Banaschewski4 , Jan Buitelaar5,6 , Manfred D\u00f6pfner7 and Richard Ammer1,8\nConclusion\nThis study examined the medium-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ADHD medication use by analyzing sales data of 28 European countries from 2014 to 2022. Consistent with previous research [5, 23], we observed a wide variation in ADHD medication use, with the highest usage levels in Northern countries and lower levels in Eastern Europe. However, all countries except Luxembourg and Romania recorded an increasing trend in linear regression models significant at the 5% level in the pre-pandemic period from 2014 to 2019. After a drop in 2020, especially in the second quarter, when social mitigation measures were taken to prevent the spread of the at the time novel Coronavirus, medication consumption returned to the predicted level by 2021 in most countries. Towards the end of 2021, usage levels even tended to exceed predictions. Throughout Europe, the actual consumption was 2.3% below predictions in 2020. In contrast, in 2021, consumption surpassed pre-pandemic predictions by 2.6%. While these exceedances in 2021 might be a catch-up effect due to reduced consumption in previous quarters, the noticeably increased growth observed in all four quarters of 2022 argues in favour of the pandemic having a catalyzing effect on ADHD medication consumption growth in the long run. Throughout Europe, the annual ADHD medicine consumption, predicted as 3.08 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, achieved an actual value of 3.43 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, corresponding to a relative rise of 11.5%. At country-level, 23 of the 28 European countries recorded higher ADHD medication sales volumes than predicted, ten of them even surpassed expectations by more than 20%. On average, national annual consumption was 16.4% higher than predicted. Quarterly comparisons of predictions and actual values revealed relatively small deviations in Quarter 1 of 2022 but increasing positive deviations in the following quarters with Quarter 4 showing the highest mean national exceedance of forecasts by more than 23%.\nIn all European countries examined, the estimated regression time trend parameter in the post-pandemic period (2021 to 2022) was higher than in the pre-pandemic period (2014 to 2019). Decreasing trends in Romania and Luxembourg were reversed after the pandemic. In 26 of the 28 countries, the post-pandemic time trend was significantly larger than before the pandemic. In the European total, the slope estimator rose significantly (p < 0.001) from 0.03 in the pre-pandemic period to 0.11 in the post-pandemic period.\nFurther research is needed to investigate the long-term impact of the pandemic on ADHD prevalence and prescribing patterns as well as medication trends beyond the study period. Moreover, analyses of this study should also be carried out for countries in other continents, to examine if this is a European trend only or if similar effects can be observed globally.

        "discussion": "Discussion\nIn this study, we found an increased consumption growth of ADHD medications in Europe after the pandemic. A possible cause is the general increase of mental health issues caused by anti-pandemic mitigation measures, including the worsening of ADHD symptoms [6, 21]. Recent research showed a medium-term impact of pandemic-related stress on children with ADHD [26]. Social withdrawal is also associated with a decreased likelihood of symptom remission in patients with major psychiatric disorders [20], which potentially led to greater ADHD medication demand in the long run. However, other factors unrelated to the pandemic might have also been contributing to the rise in ADHD medication sales. Changing diagnosis criteria as well as increasing awareness of ADHD in media and social media, indicated, e.g., by a steadily increasing popularity of the Google search term \"ADHD\" [13], led to a significantly increased prevalence in recent years, especially in individuals of colour and females [1]. Although the role of social media and \"ADHD influencer\" are a relatively new phenomenon, the number of views on TikTok of the hashtag #ADHD was frequently reported as 11 billion as of May 2022 [17] and has reached 33 billion now [27]. Also, access to an ADHD diagnosis has become easier. In several countries, the initial referral to a diagnosis can now be carried out be a GP rather than a psychotherapist [2, 3]. This is a response to the high demand of psychiatric support in comparison to the limited resource, resulting in long waiting times to diagnoses and therapies. Both of these effects, social media and easier access, potentially have been amplified by the pandemic, where access to healthcare resources was limited, but the psychological burden of social isolation and the time spent on social media largely increased.\nIn line with our results, other studies analyzing the impact of the pandemic on medication use found a significant increase in the consumption of psychotropic drugs in the French population after March 2020 [7] and an increase in rates of psychotropic medication use and psychiatric disorder diagnoses for Danish youths from March 2020 to June 22 [8]. We have also carried out analogous analysis for 17 other countries in different regions of the world. With four notable exceptions (e.g. China, Indonesia), a very similar picture emerges throughout the world. However, as we do not have complete data coverage of the world, most notably, not of North America, which is by far the biggest market of ADHD medicine, this study focused on Europe. Although Europe comprises different cultural areas with quite diverse histories and perceptions of ADHD and strong differences in the diagnosis prevalence, the increase in the consumption trend was observed throughout all considered European countries. This provides evidence that this is not a localized effect that can be attributed to cultural or healthcare-system-specific reasons.\nIn this study, the use of international pharmaceutical sales data enabled an analysis and quantification of the medium- and long-term effect of the COVID-19 pandemic response measures on ADHD medication consumption in Europe. However, the prevalence of ADHD was not examined as this study only evaluates sales data of ADHD medications. Furthermore, the data do not contain individual-level treatment data necessary to measure trends by age, gender, or appropriateness of prescribing. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions regarding overuse, underuse, or misuse.",

        "introduction": "The appropriate selection of passive and active defensive behaviors in threatening situations is essential for survival. Previous studies have shown that passive defensive responses depend on activity of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), whereas active ones primarily rely on the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the mechanisms underlying flexible switching between these two types of responses remain unknown. Here we show in mice that the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) mediates the selection of defensive behaviors through its interaction with the CeA and the NAc. We show that the PVT-CeA pathway drives conditioned freezing responses, whereas the PVT-NAc pathway is inhibited during freezing and, instead, signals active avoidance events. Optogenetic manipulations revealed that activity in the PVT-CeA or PVT-NAc pathway biases behavior toward the selection of passive or active defensive responses, respectively. These findings provide evidence that the PVT mediates flexible switching between opposing defensive behaviors.\nMa et al. show that the PVT biases the selection of passive and active defensive behaviors via mostly segregated projections to the CeA and the NAc. Their results update current views on the role of the midline thalamus in fear-related behaviors.\nAuthor(s): Jun Ma 1 , Johann du Hoffmann 2 3 , Morgan Kindel 1 , B.

In contrast, the mechanisms controlling instrumental defensive responses, such as active avoidance and those that guide the selection of passive and active defensive behaviors, are far less studied5-8 . This is surprising considering that, in nature, animals readily engage and switch between both types of defensive strategies depending on threat imminence8-10 .\nAlthough studies on the neurobiology of defensive behaviors have pointed to the contributions of both cortical and subcortical networks to the expression of specific defensive behaviors8,10 , it is generally recognized that Pavlovian reactions, such as freezing and conditioned flight, are driven by genetically defined neuronal subpopulations of the CeA4,11,12 and that active defensive behaviors largely depend on the NAc13-15 . Interestingly, reports from the last decade suggest that these two regions of the brain likely compete for the control of defensive behaviors13,16 . Specifically, these studies demonstrated that, although lesions and pharmacological manipulations of the CeA attenuate freezing and promote active avoidance behavior16,17 , inactivation of the NAc decreases avoidance but enhances freezing13,14 . Despite these seminal observations, the mechanisms dictating the balance of the competition between these two regions and behavioral outcomes remain unknown.\nA potential candidate for mediating the selection of these two types of defensive behaviors is the basolateral amygdala (BLA), because it sends projections to both the NAc and the CeA18 . Indeed, BLA projections to the CeA are known to mediate conditioned freezing responses19 , whereas BLA projections to the NAc have been shown to support active avoidance behavior14 . However, the necessity of the BLA for the expression of conditioned freezing and avoidance behaviors decreases with the passage of time20-22 , suggesting that other brain regions likely contribute to arbitrating between these two defensive strategies. We predicted that the posterior portion of the PVT (pPVT) could be implicated in this process, considering its strong innervation of the CeA and the NAc23,24 as well as its documented role in mediating conditioned freezing responses, particularly at remote time points12,22 . Consistent with this prediction, here we show that the pPVT drives active avoidance through its projections to the NAc. Moreover, we demonstrate that divergent projections from the pPVT to the NAc and CeA mediate the selection of active avoidance and freezing behavior, respectively. These findings highlight the existence of a previously unrecognized switch for the selection of passive and active defensive behaviors in the midline thalamus.",
        "methodology": "Methods\nMice\nAll procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice used in this study were group housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle (6:00-18:00 light), at temperature of 70-74 \u00b0F and 40-65% humidity, with food and water available ad libitum. After surgery, mice were singly housed. Drd2-Cre mice were obtained from GENSAT (founder line ER44). In addition, we used C57BL/6NJ strain mice (The Jackson Laboratory). Both male and female mice 8-20 weeks of age were used for all experiments. Animals were randomly allocated to the different experimental conditions reported in this study.\nViral vectors\nAAV9-hSyn-Flex-GCaMP6s-WPRE-SV40 was produced by the Vector Core of the University of Pennsylvania. AAV9-EF1[alpha]-DIO-eNpHR3.0-mCherry, AAV2-CaMKII2[alpha]-eNpHR3.0-mCherry, AAV2-CaMKII2[alpha]-mCherry, AAV2-EF1[alpha]-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-YFP-WPRE and AAV2-EF1[alpha]-DIO-mCherry were produced by the Vector Core of the University of North Carolina. AAV5-hSyn-FLEX-ChrimsonR-tdTomato (Addgene, plasmid no. 62723), AAV9-CAG-FLEX-tdTomato (Addgene, plasmid no. 28306) and AAV9-Syn-Flex-jGCaMP7s-WPRE (Addgene, plasmid no. 104491) were purchased from Addgene. AAV2(retro)-CAG-iCre (Addgene, plasmid no. 81070) was produced by Vector Biolabs. AAV9-EF1a-FLEX-TVA-mCherry (Addgene, plasmid no. 38044) and AAV9-CAG-FLEX-RG (Addgene, plasmid no. 38043) were produced by Vigene Biosciences. EnvA-SAD-[DELTA]G-eGFP (Addgene, plasmid no. 32635) was produced by the Viral Vector Core of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. All viral vectors were stored in aliquots at -80 \u00b0C until use.\nStereotaxic surgery\nAll viral injections were performed using previously described procedures12 and an AngleTwo stereotaxic device (Leica Biosystems) at the following stereotaxic coordinates: pPVT, -1.60 mm from bregma, 0.06 mm lateral from midline and -3.30 mm vertical from cortical surface, 6.12\u00b0 angle for both fiber photometry and optogenetics; NAc, 1.70 mm from bregma, 0.60 mm lateral from midline and -4.60 mm vertical from cortical surface, 9.99\u00b0 angle for optogenetics; CeA, -1.42 mm from bregma, 2.90 mm lateral from midline and -4.80 mm vertical from cortical surface. For fiber photometry and optogenetic experiments, an optical fiber (400 [mu]m for photometry, Doric Lenses; 200 [mu]m for optogenetics, ThorLabs) was implanted over the target immediately after viral injections and cemented using Metabond Cement System (Parkell) and Jet Brand dental acrylic (Lang Dental Manufacturing). For retrograde tracing of NAc-projecting and CeA-projecting pPVT cells, CTB-647 and CTB-555 (1.0% in PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were injected into the NAc (0.5 [mu]l) and CeA (0.3 [mu]l), respectively, and allowed 4 d for retrograde transport. After all surgical procedures, animals were returned to their home cages and placed on a heating pad for 24 h for post-surgical recovery and monitoring. Animals received subcutaneous injections with Metacam (meloxicam, 1-2 mg kg-1 ) for analgesia and anti-inflammatory purposes. Mice without correct targeting of optical fibers, tracers or vectors were excluded from this study.\nFiber photometry\nFiber photometry was performed as previously described28,29 . Briefly, mice were allowed to habituate to the fiber patch cord in their home cage for approximately 5 min before each behavior test. GCaMP fluorescence and isosbestic autofluorescence signals were excited by the fiber photometry system (Doric Lenses) using two sinusoidally modulated 473 nm (211 Hz) and 405 nm (531 Hz) LEDs (DC4100, ThorLabs). Both LEDs were combined via a commercial Mini Cube fiber photometry apparatus (Doric Lenses) into a fiber patch cord (400-[mu]m core, 0.48 NA) connected to the brain implant in each mouse. The light intensity at the interface between the fiber tip and the animal was adjusted from 10 [mu]W to 20 [mu]W (but was constant throughout each test session for each mouse). An RZ5P fiber photometry acquisition system with Synapse software (Tucker-Davis Technologies) collected and saved real-time demodulated emission signals and behavior-relevant TTL inputs. For each trial, GCaMP signals (F 473 nm ) were compared with autofluorescence signals (F 405 nm ) to control for movement and bleaching artifacts. Signal data were de-trended by first applying a least-squares linear fit to produce F fitted 405 nm , and dF /F was calculated as (F 473 nm - F fitted 405 nm )/F fitted 405 nm . All GCaMP signal data are presented as the z-score of the dF /F from baseline (pre-CS) segments.\nFear conditioning\nBefore training, mice were handled and habituated to the fiber patch cord in the conditioning context. Mice were fear conditioned in a Mouse Test Cage (18 cm \u00d7 18 cm \u00d7 30 cm) equipped with an electrifiable floor connected to a shock generator (H13-15, Coulbourn Instruments) and placed inside a sound attenuated cabinet (H10-24A, Coulbourn Instruments). The auditory fear conditioning procedure was carried in two different contexts: a Context A (habituation and conditioning) and a Context B (retrieval). The cabinet was illuminated at all times, and the subject's behavior was captured with a USB camera (ACT-VP-02, Coulbourn Instruments) at 3.7 Hz during each session. FreezeFrame software (Actimetrics) was used to control the delivery of both 4-kHz, 75-dB tones (30 s; CS) and 0.6-mA footshocks (2 s; US).\nFor habituation, a 120-s pre-stimulus interval (PSI) was followed by four trials of CS presentations with pseudorandom 30-60-s ITI in Context A. Fear conditioning was conducted in Context A. The same PSI was followed by five trials of CS presentations that co-terminated with the US, with pseudorandom 30-60-s ITI. A fear memory retrieval session was conducted in Context B. The same PSI was followed by eight trials of unreinforced CS presentations with pseudorandom 30-120-s ITI. Freezing behavior was recorded and analyzed with FreezeFrame. For the retrieval session, the freezing data of all the trials were linearly aligned from maximus to minimum (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Based on the distribution, all trials were divided into three groups: low freezing (L; Freezing <40%; n = 20 trials), moderate freezing (M; 40%[less than or equal to] Freezing [less than or equal to]60%; n = 16 trials) and high freezing (H; Freezing >60%; n = 12 trials).\n2AA\nMice were trained on the 2AA as previously described16 . Briefly, the behavioral apparatus consisted of a custom-built shuttle box (18 cm \u00d7 36 cm \u00d7 30 cm) that contained two identical chambers separated by a hurdle (17.5 cm \u00d7 6 cm). The hurdle projected 3 cm above the floor and allowed mice easy access to both chambers. The floor consisted of electrifiable metal rods (H10-11M-TC-SF, Coulbourn Instruments) and was connected to a shock generator (H13-15, Coulbourn Instruments). Before each subject was trained/tested, the shuttle box was wiped clean with 70% ethanol. The mouse's behavior was captured with a USB camera during each session. A speaker located on the top of the shuttle box (50 cm high) was used to deliver the CS. Subjects' movement and TTLs of CS, US and optogenetic stimulation were recorded by ANY-maze version 5 (Stoelting).\nAfter a 5-min habituation period, mice were trained with daily sessions of 2AA, each consisting of 30 presentations of the CS (lasting up to 15 s each). Trials in which subjects failed to shuttle to the adjacent chamber before the termination of the CS resulted in the presentation of the US (lasting up to 15 s each) until subjects escaped to the opposite chamber (failure trials). For trials in which subjects shuttled to the opposite chamber during the CS, the CS was abruptly terminated, and the US was also prevented (avoidance trials). Avoidance rate was calculated as the percentage of the number of avoidance trials over the total number of trials.\nIn Fig. 2a-h, mice were subjected to five 2AA sessions (one session per day), and the GCaMP signal was collected on Days 4-5 as described above. In Fig. 2i-l, mice were initially trained for 5 d. If a subject did not reach 30% of avoidance rate by Day 5, it was not used in further test sessions. Test sessions consisted of CS presentations (no US). In the second test session, subjects received light stimulation with a yellow light source (Ce:YAG + LED Driver, Doric Lenses) during each CS presentation (light onset was 5 s before the onset of the CS and culminated 5 s after the offset of the CS). The light intensity at the interface between the fiber tip and the mouse was ~10 mW. In Figs. 3, 4 and 6, mice were initially trained for 3 d. GCaMP signal was collected across Days 4-5. In Fig. 5, mice were initially trained for 3 d. If a subject did not reach 70% of avoidance rate by Day 3, it was not used in further testing sessions. As described above, these test sessions involved CS presentations (no US), and the subjects received light stimulation paired to CS presentations during the second test session. In Fig. 7, we selectively screened for poor avoiders as follows: mice with [less than or equal to]30% of avoidance rate by Training Day 3 were poor avoiders used for further test. As these are essentially mice that failed to learn active avoidance, subsequent test sessions involved presentations of both the CS and the US while subjects received light stimulation paired to the CS from the second to the sixth test sessions. In Extended Data Figs. 5-8, mice were initially trained for 3 d and tested with another 3 d subsequently. These test sessions involved both CS and US presentations, and the subjects received light stimulation paired to CS presentations during the second test session. For experiments in which we optogenetically manipulated pPVT or its circuits during ITIs (Extended Data Figs. 4-6), mice were initially trained for 3 d and tested with another 3 d subsequently. These test sessions involved both CS and US presentations, and the subjects received light stimulation paired to ITIs during the second test session. In Fig. 8 and Extended Data Fig. 9, mice were initially trained for 3 d and tested with another 4 d subsequently. These test sessions involved both CS and US presentations, and the subjects received light stimulation paired to CS presentations through NAc-implanted opto fibers during the second test session and CeA-implanted opto fibers during the third test session.",
        "analysis": "Data analysis for 2AA\nWe performed post hoc position tracking of the animal's nose and body center from video in the software TopScan (CleverSys). CS and US times from ANY-maze and raw video tracking position values from TopScan were exported, and analysis was performed with custom routines in the R statistical computing environment (R Core Team 2019, R Foundation).\nMissing positions up to ten successive frames were linearly interpolated with custom routines in R. For imaging sessions, video tracking and ANY-maze TTL pulse timestamps were zero corrected to align behavioral and calcium signal timestamps. Next, calcium signals and/or position frames during US and CS were flagged by matching the relevant timestamps to TTL pulse times from ANY-maze, and the frame-by-frame distance traveled for the nose and body center was calculated for the tracking data. To minimize the effects of noise in the tracking data, we calculated the 40% quantile of the frame-by-frame distance traveled by the animal's nose and body center for each session; in all cases, this yielded a distance value of 0 or 1 mm. This quantile value served as a movement threshold--that is, an inter-frame distance traveled less than or equal to the quantile value was considered non-movement. We then created a binary vector, and frames with coincident immobility of the nose and center body were set to 1. Changepoint analysis55 (R package version 2.2.2 (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=changepoint)), with a minimum segment length of 30 video frames, was then applied to this vector. This approach allowed us to statistically determine when transitions to (and from) coincident periods of non-movement of nose and body occurred, which were used as a proxy for freezing behavior. Next, each sustained bout of non-movement was isolated, and we probed whether there was any movement that lasted for [greater than or equal to]5 consecutive video frames. If such movement did occur, we truncated the bout of immobility at the start of movement. Finally, immobility bouts with a duration [greater than or equal to]1 s were considered freezing. To ensure robustness of our method, we compared statistically derived event flags against manually scored videos in a subset of behavioral sessions.\nWe isolated freezing events (see freeze detection section above) that occurred during the CS as CS freezing and those that occurred during ITI as ITI freezing. For each trial, we calculated the time interval between the moment of animal crossing the hurdle and the CS onset, named latency to avoid. CS, ITI freezing or latency to avoid were average within session and then within each group and plotted as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m.\nFor fiber photometry, GCaMP data were normalized as dF /F . Next, we used the behavioral flags calculated from the video tracking to create average peri-event time histograms (PETHs) time-locked to the onset of the behavior events of interest, including CS onset (CS), highest movement velocity during the CS (Max. Velocity), escape or avoidance movement onset (Escape Initiate), escape or avoidance moment (Escape) and freezing onset during the CS (Freezing). All trials in each session were separated into avoidance and failure trials as described above. For each trial type, the z-score from 10 s before to 30 s after CS onset was plotted in heat maps for all trials in test sessions. The mean of all recorded activity for each trial type was plotted below the corresponding heat map. We isolated the calcium signal from 2 s before to 2 s after the onset of each behavior event from avoidance and failure trials separately. Using the 2 s before the onset as a baseline for each event, we calculated z-scores and area under the curve (AUC) of the z-score from 2 s after the onset of each behavior event. Lastly, we plotted the mean of signal transitions and AUC for each event type from each trial type. All 2AA photometric signals and behavioral performance were analyzed blinded.\nOptogenetic inhibition of pPVT neurons and projections in an open field arena\nAfter habituating to the fiber patch cord in the home cage for 10 min, mice were placed in a square enclosure (50 cm \u00d7 50 cm) to roam freely for 6 min. Mice received 2 min of light stimulation 2 min after the beginning of the test (min 2-4). The light intensity at the interface between the fiber tip and the mouse was ~10 mW. The cumulative distance traveled in the open field apparatus was tracked, recorded and quantified using ANY-maze behavioral tracking software.\nMonosynaptic tracing of inputs to NAc-projecting or CeA-projecting neurons of the PVT\nTo limit monosynaptic rabies tracing to NAc-projecting or CeA-projecting neurons of the PVT, AAV2(retro)-CAG-iCre was bilaterally injected into the NAc (0.5 [mu]l per injection) or CeA (0.3 [mu]l per injection) of C57BL/6NJ mice. Within the same surgical procedure, a virus mixture of AAV9-EF1a-FLEX-TVA-mCherry and AAV9-CAG-FLEX-RG at a 1:1 ratio was injected into the pPVT (1.5 [mu]l), followed by an injection of the pseudotyped rabies virus EnvA-SAD-[DELTA]G-eGFP (1.5 [mu]l) in the same location of pPVT 2 weeks later. Mouse brain tissues were collected and subjected to analysis 1 week later. Brain sections were scanned by an AxioScan (Carl Zeiss) with a \u00d75 objective. Cells were detected and quantified on NeuroInfo (MBF Bioscience). Starter cell count was generated by quantifying number of mCherry and GFP double-positive pPVT cells. We generated a connectivity index by normalizing the fraction of retrogradely labeled (GFP+ ) cells for a given brain region to the number of starter cells. Connectivity indices for each region were average within groups (CeA-projecting and NAc-projecting). Regions neighboring the pPVT (midline and medial thalamic nuclei) were excluded from our analyses due to the possibility of artifacts related to the injection site. All monosynaptic rabies tracing data were analyzed by a blinded experimenter.\nHistology and immunofluorescence\nAnimals were deeply anesthetized with euthanasia solution (Vet One) and transcardially perfused with PBS (pH 7.4, 4 \u00b0C), followed by paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution (4% in PBS, 4 \u00b0C). After extraction, brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C for a minimum of 2 h and subsequently cryoprotected by transferring to a 30% PBS-buffered sucrose solution until brains were saturated (for over 24 h). Coronal brain sections (50 [mu]m) were cut using a freezing microtome (SM 2010R, Leica). For immunofluorescence staining, brain sections were incubated in PBS (pH 7.4) with 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h and then incubated using the following antibody (overnight, at 4 \u00b0C): anti-D2R (1:300, rabbit, Frontier Institute, D2R-Rb-Af960). After washing, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, goat anti-mouse, Molecular Probes A-11001). Finally, sections were subsequently mounted onto glass slides for imaging (LSM 780 laser scanning confocal microscope, Carl Zeiss). Image analysis and cell counting were performed using ImageJ software (Fiji, version 1.52p). Optical fiber placements for all mice included in this study are presented in Figs 2a, 3c, 4b, 5c, 6b and 7c and Extended Data Figs. 1a, 4b,l, 5b, 6b, 8b,m and 9a.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nAll data were plotted and analyzed with OriginPro version 2016 and version 2018 (OriginLab) and GraphPad Prism (version 8.0.1, GraphPad Software). All data are presented as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m. There were no assumptions or corrections made before data analysis. Differences between two groups were tested with a two-tailed Student's t -test; differences among multiple groups were examined with analysis of variance (ANOVA, one-way and two-way repeated-measures) followed by two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli; P < 0.05 was considered significant. The sample sizes used in our study, such as the numbers of animals, are typically the same or exceed those estimated by power analysis (power = 0.80, [alpha] = 0.05). For tracing experiments, the sample size is 2-5 mice. For fiber photometry experiments, the sample size is 4-6 mice. For optogenetic experiments, the sample size is 4-13 mice. All experiments were replicated at least once, and similar results were obtained. All experiments were randomized, and investigators were blinded to allocation during experiments. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested\nReporting Summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nOnline content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00912-7.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank former NIMH postbac N.

        "results": "Results\npPVTD2R neurons are inhibited during freezing\nThe pPVT is a stress-sensitive region of the thalamus that sends robust, largely non-overlapping projections to the CeA and the NAc (Fig. 1a-d)25 . Unlike primates and carnivores, the rodent thalamus is largely devoid of GABAergic neurons26 . Thus, projection neurons of the PVT are predominantly glutamatergic27 . Although activation of CeA-projecting pPVT neurons is thought to be necessary for the retrieval of conditioned fear memory and its accompanying of freezing behavior12,22 , the NAc is the main target of most pPVT neurons (Fig. 1e-j)25 . Surprisingly, the contribution of pPVT-NAc neurons to fear-related behaviors is currently unknown. To investigate this, we first monitored the activity of dopamine D2 receptor expressing neurons of the pPVT (pPVTD2R )--a marker of stress-sensitive PVT neurons, most of which project to the NAc (Fig. 1g-j)28-30 --during fear conditioning (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). Toward this goal, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6s in pPVTD2R neurons of Drd2 -Cre mice (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Next, after a habituation session (Day 0), on Day 1 mice were fear conditioned to an auditory cue (conditioned stimulus (CS)) that co-terminated with a footshock (unconditioned stimulus (US)), and on Day 2 a fear memory retrieval test was performed (Extended Data Fig. 1b-e). On both days, bulk changes in GCaMP6s fluorescence in pPVTD2R neurons were monitored using fiber photometry. We reasoned that, because most pPVTD2R neurons project to the NAc, bulk GCaMP6s fluorescence gathered from this neuronal population with fiber photometry would likely be dominated by the activity of PVT-NAc neurons. Consistent with previous reports, pPVTD2R neurons were readily activated by the US during the conditioning session on Day 1 (refs. 28,29 ) (Extended Data Fig. 1g,j,n,o). Notably, we also observed the emergence of small but consistent CS-evoked GCaMP6s responses in late conditioning trials, suggesting that the activity of these neurons is modulated by learning22 (Extended Data Fig. 1l,m). On Day 2, fear memory retrieval was associated with an average decrease in GCaMP6s fluorescence upon CS presentation (Extended Data Fig. 1h,k). These inhibitory GCaMP6s responses were variable and apparent in many, but not all, CS presentations (Extended Data Fig. 2a), suggesting that they could be tied to behavior. To explore this possibility, we classified all retrieval trials into three groups based on the percentage of freezing displayed and quantified the average CS-evoked response for each trial category (Extended Data Fig. 2a-d and Methods). As predicted, the average change in GCaMP6s fluorescence for each trial category varied as a function of freezing behavior, with the highest freezing scores being associated with the most robust inhibitory responses (Extended Data Fig. 2a-g). Notably, we did not observe any effect of retrieval trial number on the GCaMP6s signal (Extended Data Fig. 2h-j). These results indicate the existence of an inverse relationship between freezing behavior and pPVTD2R neuron activity. Consistent with this, pairwise comparisons of CS-evoked movement and GCaMP6s fluorescence uncovered a modest but positive correlation between these two parameters (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Notably, no such correlation was observed on imaging data gathered during habituation, before fear conditioning (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). As such, our collective results demonstrate that conditioned freezing is associated with decreased activity among pPVTD2R neurons.\nFig. 1\npPVTD2R projections to NAc and CeA are partially segregated.\na , Schematic of the viral vector strategy for anterograde tracing pPVT projections. b , Representative images showing Halo-mCherry expression in neurons of the pPVT (left) and axon terminals within the NAc (middle) and the CeA (right). c , Schematic of the viral vector strategy for anterograde tracing pPVTD2R projections. d , Representative images showing ChR2-YFP expression in pPVTD2R neurons (left) and axon terminals within the NAc (middle) and the CeA (right). e , Schematic of the retrograde tracing strategy used for labeling CeA- and NAc-projecting pPVT neurons. f , Representative images showing the targets for dual-color CTB injections, green into the NAc (left) and red into the CeA (right). g , Representative images showing that the retrograde labeled NAc-projecting cells (green) and CeA-projecting cells (red) are predominantly present in the D2R-labeled (gray) pPVT region. h , Quantification of the density of CeA- and NAc-projecting neurons in the pPVT.

To formally assess this possibility, after expressing GCaMP6s in pPVTD2R neurons of Drd2 -Cre mice (Fig. 2a), we trained mice in a two-way signaled active avoidance (2AA) task where performing a specific action--moving to the neighboring compartment of a shuttle box--upon presentation of the CS, enables mice to avoid a footshock (US) (Fig. 2b). Mice that are well-trained on this task typically forgo passive (freezing) responses to CS presentation in favor of active (avoidance) responses (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3)6 . Nevertheless, on a trial-by-trial basis, they do engage in both freezing and avoidance behavior upon CS presentation (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). As such, this task provides an opportunity for assessing neuronal activity while animals transition between passive and instrumental fear-related behavioral responses within single test sessions. Consistent with previous reports, mice displayed prominent freezing behavior to the CS in early sessions of the 2AA task6 (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3a). However, additional training led to progressive decreases in CS-evoked freezing and a concomitant increase in active avoidance responses (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3a). After three sessions of 2AA training (Days 1-3), pPVTD2R neurons were imaged using fiber photometry during two additional training sessions (Days 4 and 5) (Fig. 2c). Imaging trials were subsequently divided into two behaviorally relevant categories: trials in which mice avoided the US (avoidance) and trials in which they failed to do so (failure). Notably, during failure trials, mice reliably shuttled to the adjacent compartment in response to the US (Supplementary Video 1). The data for avoidance and failure trials are summarized in Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3 (Fig. 2d-h and Extended Data Fig. 3b-d). Classifying trials in this manner revealed important differences in the activity of pPVTD2R neurons during avoidance and failure trials (Supplementary Video 1). First, CS presentation elicited robust increases in GCaMP6s fluorescence in pPVTD2R neurons during avoidance trials, whereas, in failure trials, it mostly induced strong decreases in the activity of these neurons (Fig. 2g). In addition, presentation of the US during failure trials was associated with robust activation of pPVTD2R neurons, consistent with our fear conditioning data as well as with previous reports (Fig. 2d,e)28,29 . Interestingly, whereas mice engaged in instrumental responses during avoidance trials (by definition), they spent significantly more time freezing in response to the CS during failure trials compared to avoidance trials (Fig. 2f). This suggests that the differential dynamics of calcium signals of pPVTD2R neurons observed across these trial categories could be related to behavior. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed calcium transients time-locked to discrete task and behavioral events, such as CS onset, maximum velocity and freezing behavior (Fig. 2h). These analyses revealed that, although CS onset, maximum velocity and escape behavior (shuttling in response to the CS or US onset) were all associated with increases in GCaMP6s fluorescence, freezing behavior was accompanied by attenuated pPVTD2R neuronal activity for both avoidance and failure trials (Fig. 2h). Thus, although mean signal variations more accurately distinguish avoidance and failure trials (Fig. 2f,g), discrete fluctuations in calcium transients largely reflect moment-to-moment variation in behavior rather than trial type (Fig. 2h). It is interesting that rises in neuronal activity were correlated with maximum velocity particularly for avoidance trials (Fig. 2h). This result indicates a potential relationship between pPVTD2R neuron activity and vigor, such as that necessary to avoid or escape an impending threat. Collectively, our findings support the idea that, at the population level, pPVTD2R neurons signal instrumental defensive behaviors and are suppressed during freezing.\nFig. 2\npPVTD2R neurons control active avoidance and are inhibited during freezing.\na , Representative image of GCaMP6s expression and fiber placements (n = 5 mice). b , Schematic of the 2AA task. c , Behavior performance during 2AA. d , Representative imaging traces for avoidance and failure trials. e , Top, heat maps of calcium responses.

After 2AA training, mice were subjected to three test sessions: Test Days 1-3 (Fig. 2j-l). On Test Day 1 (light off), both control and Halo-expressing mice displayed robust avoidance behavior (Fig. 2j,k). On Test Day 2 (light on), light stimulation during CS presentations significantly attenuated the avoidance rate of Halo-expressing but not control mice (Fig. 2j,k). This effect was accompanied by a significant increase in the latency to avoid and an increase in CS-evoked freezing behavior (Fig. 2k,l). These parameters partially recovered on Test Day 3 (light off) (Fig. 2j-l). Notably, restricting optogenetic inhibition of pPVTD2R neurons to the inter-trial interval (ITI) did not significantly alter behavior (Extended Data Fig. 4k-t). Similarly, we did not observe any light stimulation-induced effect on locomotion in an open field arena (Extended Data Fig. 4j). In summary, these findings show that, at the population level, pPVTD2R neurons are required for active avoidance behavior and are inhibited during freezing.\npPVT-NAc projections drive avoidance and antagonize freezing\nAlthough most pPVTD2R neurons project to the NAc (Fig. 1)29 , it is unclear whether pPVTD2R -NAc projections are modulated by passive and/or active responding in the 2AA task. To address this question, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP7s in pPVTD2R neurons and implanted an optical fiber unilaterally in the NAc to measure the activity of pPVTD2R -NAc projections using fiber photometry (Fig. 3a-e). We trained GCaMP7s-expressing mice in the 2AA task, classified individual test trials as either avoidance or failure as described above and analyzed the corresponding change in fluorescent signal associated with presentations of the CS (Fig. 3f-k). To ensure sufficient numbers of avoidance and failure trials during imaging sessions, mice were trained for only 3 d before imaging started (Fig. 3d, e). These analyses revealed that pPVTD2R -NAc projections were rapidly engaged after CS presentation and were robustly activated during both avoidance and escape episodes irrespective of trial type (Fig. 3k). In contrast, CS-evoked freezing was associated with a reduction in GCaMP7s fluorescence in this projection (Fig. 3k). These calcium dynamics largely resembled those observed in pPVTD2R neurons (Fig. 2d-h and Extended Data Fig. 3b). Together, these findings demonstrate that pPVTD2R -NAc projections signal active avoidance and are suppressed during freezing behavior.\nFig. 3\npPVTD2R -NAc axon terminals signal active avoidance.\na , Schematic of the experimental approach for fiber photometry imaging of pPVTD2R -NAc terminals. b , Representative images of GCaMP7s expression in pPVTD2R neurons and optical fiber placement in NAc. c , Fiber placements (n = 4 mice). d , Avoidance Rate and CS Freezing across training and imaging sessions. e , Latency to avoid and ITI Freezing for data in e . f , Representative imaging traces from sample subject. g , Top, heat maps of calcium responses for avoidance and failure trials.

All data in the figure are shown as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m.\nSource data\nIt is important to highlight that, unlike calcium responses recorded from the cell bodies of pPVTD2R neurons, for which increases were readily observed during shuttling events (Fig. 2d), increases in GCaMP7 fluorescence in pPVTD2R -NAc terminals appeared to emerge mostly at the conclusion of avoidance behavior (CS offset) (Fig. 3f,g). One potential explanation to this finding is that calcium transients accompanying avoidance behavior could result in weaker fluorescent changes at pPVTD2R -NAc axon terminals, thereby limiting our ability to accurately detect these with fiber photometry. To circumvent this limitation, we employed a viral vector strategy that allowed us to record the cell bodies of NAc-projecting neurons directly in the pPVT (Fig. 4a,b). As with our axon terminal imaging experiment, mice were first trained in the 2AA task for three sessions, and then fiber photometry imaging from the cell bodies of pPVT-NAc neurons was performed during two additional sessions (Fig. 4c,d). Notably, our results largely resembled those obtained from pPVTD2R neurons (Fig. 4e-j). In particular, we noticed that, although pPVT-NAc neurons were strongly recruited during avoidance trials, they were mostly suppressed during failures (Fig. 4i). Moreover, pPVT-NAc neurons signaled active behavioral responses and were, instead, inhibited during freezing (Fig. 4e,j and Supplementary Video 2). Together, these findings demonstrate that pPVT projections to the NAc predominantly signal active defensive responses.\nFig. 4\nNAc-projecting neurons of the pPVT signal active avoidance.\na , Schematic of the experimental approach for fiber photometry imaging from pPVT-NAc neurons. b , Fiber placements (n = 5 mice). c , Avoidance Rate and CS freezing across training and imaging sessions. d , Latency to avoid and ITI freezing for data in c . e , Representative imaging traces from sample subject. f , Top, heat maps of calcium responses for avoidance and failure trials.

All data in the figure are shown as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m.\nSource data\nNext, to investigate whether activation of pPVT-NAc projections is critical for active avoidance, we optogenetically inhibited pPVTD2R -NAc projections bilaterally using Halo in a cohort of mice displaying robust avoidance behavior after training (>70% initial avoidance rate; Methods and Fig. 5a-c). Similarly to the experiment described above, after 2AA training (Fig. 5d-g) mice were subjected to three test sessions (Test Days 1-3), and, on Test Day 2, light stimulation was delivered through optical fibers to silence pPVTD2R -NAc communication during CS presentations. Unlike in control subjects, light stimulation in Halo-expressing mice significantly decreased avoidance rate and increased the latency to avoid (Fig. 5h,i). In addition, these mice showed a concomitant increase in CS-evoked freezing on Test Day 2 (Fig. 5j,k). Notably, pairwise comparison of light-evoked changes in freezing and avoidance behavior across test sessions revealed an inverse relationship between these two parameters (Fig. 5l). Together, these results demonstrate that silencing pPVTD2R -NAc communication biases defensive behavioral responses toward passive coping strategies. Notably, this effect is independent of the post-training avoidance rate, because similar observations were made in a cohort of mice in which the initial avoidance rate was markedly lower (Extended Data Fig. 5a-k). Moreover, our observation that optogenetic inhibition of pPVT-NAc projections on Test Day 2 lead to lasting behavioral effects on Test Day 3 indicates a potential role for this projection in the formation of persistent associations between fear cues and specific coping strategies. Finally, restricting optogenetic inhibition of pPVT-NAc projections to the ITI did not significantly alter behavior (Extended Data Fig. 5l-o). Similarly, as with pPVTD2R neurons, we did not observe any light stimulation-induced effect on locomotion (Extended Data Fig. 5p).\nFig. 5\nOptogenetic inhibition of pPVTD2R -NAc axon terminals decreases active avoidance and increases freezing.\na , Schematic of the viral vector strategy and optical fiber placement for optogenetic silencing of pPVTD2R -NAc axon terminals in the 2AA task. b , Representative images from a mouse expressing Halo-mCherry in pPVTD2R neurons (left) and implanted with optical fibers in the NAc (right). c , Fiber placements (n = 8 mice per group). d -g , Avoidance rate (d ), latency to avoid (e ), freezing time during the CS (f ) and ITI freezing (g ) across all training sessions for both Ctl and Halo groups. h -k , Left, Optogenetic inhibition of pPVTD2R -NAc axon terminals persistently decreases avoidance rate (h ), whereas increases latency to avoid (i ) and freezing time during the CS (j ), but has little effect on freezing time during the the ITI (k ).

All data in the figure are shown as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m.\nSource data\npPVT-CeA projections signal failure to avoid\nAs described above, pPVTD2R neurons that project to the NAc are mostly distinct from those that project to the CeA (Fig. 1)25 . However, these anatomical differences do not necessarily imply that functional distinctions exist between the two efferent pathways. Thus, to investigate how pPVTD2R -CeA projections are modulated in the 2AA task, we expressed GCaMP7s in pPVTD2R neurons of Drd2-Cre mice and implanted an optical fiber unilaterally in the CeA to measure the activity of pPVTD2R -CeA projections with fiber photometry (Fig. 6a-d). These experiments showed that, unlike pPVTD2R -NAc terminals, pPVTD2R -CeA projections are not positively modulated by avoidance (Fig. 6e-j). Surprisingly, CS-evoked freezing behavior was not associated with significant changes in GCaMP7s fluorescence (Fig. 6j). In contrast, pPVTD2R -CeA neurons were predominantly active during failure trials (Fig. 6g,j), suggesting a link between engagement of pPVTD2R -CeA projections and failure to avoid. Notably, previous studies have linked pPVT-CeA communication to the expression of conditioned fear--where Pavlovian reactions dominate behavior12,22 . Altogether, these findings suggest the existence of functional differences between pPVTD2R -CeA and pPVTD2R -NAc projections, with the activity of pPVTD2R -CeA projections increasing during failures (when freezing dominates (Fig. 6g)).\nFig. 6\nFiber photometry imaging of GCaMP7s fluorescence from the CeA terminals of pPVTD2R neurons in the 2AA task.\na , Schematic of the experimental approach for fiber photometry imaging pPVT-CeA terminals. b , Left, representative images of GCaMP7s expression and fiber placement.

Specifically, these studies showed that blocking protein synthesis in the CeA promotes active avoidance17 , whereas CeA lesions can unmask avoidance behavior in animals that initially fail to avoid after 2AA training16 . A major conclusion drawn from these studies is that CeA-driven Pavlovian reactions compete with and, thereby, prevent the expression of instrumental defensive behaviors. Because pPVT-CeA communication has been previously shown to support conditioned freezing behavior12,22 , we hypothesized that attenuating activity in pPVT-CeA projections could boost active avoidance. Consistent with this prediction, optogenetic silencing of pPVT-CeA projections using Halo reduced freezing behavior and promoted avoidance behavior (Extended Data Fig. 6a-k). Notably, this manipulation did not affect behavior when light simulation was restricted to the ITI period (Extended Data Fig. 6l-o). Together, these results suggest that silencing pPVT-CeA communication biases behavior away from passive defensive behavior and in favor of active ones. Similarly, we did not observe any light stimulation-induced effect on locomotion (Extended Data Fig. 6p).\nOf note, Halo-mediated silencing of pPVT-CeA projections also promoted active avoidance behavior in a subset of mice that failed to achieve >30% avoidance rate after the third 2AA session (Methods, Fig. 7 and Extended Data Fig. 7). Consistent with previous manipulations, the increase in avoidance behavior was accompanied by a reduction in the latency to avoid and a reduction in CS-evoked freezing (Fig. 7h,i). Moreover, pairwise comparisons revealed that, consistent with the idea that in the 2AA task animals switch between Pavlovian and instrumental defensive strategies, increases in active avoidance induced by silencing pPVT-CeA projections were linked to a reduction in freezing behavior (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Altogether, these results suggest that silencing pPVT-CeA communication biases behavior away from freezing and in favor of avoidance.\nFig. 7\nOptogenetic inhibition pPVTD2R -CeA axon terminals increases active avoidance and reduces freezing.\na , Schematic of the viral vector strategy and optical fiber placement used for optogenetic silencing of pPVTD2R -CeA axon terminals. b , Representative images from a mouse expressing Halo-mCherry in pPVTD2R neurons and implanted with optical fibers in the CeA. c , Fiber placements (n = 9 mice per group). d -f , Avoidance rate (d ), latency to avoid (e ) and freezing time during the CS (f ) across all training days in both Ctl and Halo groups. g -i , Top, avoidance rate (g ), latency to avoid (h ) and freezing time during the CS (i ) during optogenetic inhibition of pPVTD2R -CeA axon terminals.

All data in the figure are shown as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m.\nSource data\nOur collective observations indicate that task-related activity within the pPVT-NAc or the pPVT-CeA pathway biases defensive behavior toward active or passive responses, respectively. To investigate whether artificial stimulation of either pathway can generate behavioral bias, we expressed the red-shifted channelrhodopsin-2 variant ChrimsonR in pPVTD2R neurons and implanted optical fibers bilaterally over the NAc or the CeA. Consistent with our model, we observed that, although optogenetic stimulation of pPVT-NAc terminals potentiated avoidance behavior, stimulation of pPVT-CeA projections reduced it (Extended Data Fig. 8). These results lend further support to our conclusion that divergent projections of the pPVT mediate the selection of opposing defensive behaviors.\npPVT flexibly control the selection of defensive behaviors\nA recurrent theme in our reported observations is the idea that the pPVT projections to the NAc and the CeA can bias the selection of passive and active defensive behaviors. But whether these projections flexibly control defensive behavior is unclear. To assess this, we selectively silenced pPVT projections to the NAc and the CeA in the same subjects across two test sessions (Fig. 8 and Extended Data Fig. 9). Notably, we found that, although silencing pPVT-NAc projections impaired avoidance behavior (consistent with the above results), inhibition of pPVT-CeA terminals the next day fully restored active avoidance (Fig. 8e,f). Interestingly, an opposing but similarly dynamic modulation of freezing behavior was observed across sessions (Fig. 8g and Extended Data Fig. 9d). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the pPVT can flexibly bias defensive behaviors via projections to NAc and CeA. Future studies should aim at identifying the local circuit dynamics and upstream mechanisms that guide or determine which type of defensive response is selected. As a start, using monosynaptic rabies tracing, we identified regions of the mouse brain that preferentially innervate pPVT-CeA or pPVT-NAc neurons (Extended Data Fig. 10).\nFig. 8\npPVTD2R projections to the NAc and the CeA flexibly bias the selection of defensive behaviors.\na , Schematic of the viral vector strategy and optical fiber placement for optogenetic silencing of pPVTD2R -NAc or pPVTD2R -CeA axon terminals in the same subject. b -d , Avoidance rate (b ), latency to avoid (c ) and freezing time during the CS (d ) across all training sessions for both Ctl and Halo groups (n = 8 mice per group). e -g , Top, Optogenetic inhibition of pPVTD2R -NAc axon terminals (Day 2) decreases avoidance rate (e ), increases latency to avoid (f ) and freezing time during the CS (g ), whereas following optogenetic inhibition of pPVTD2R -CeA axon terminals (Day 3) reverses these changes.

        "discussion": "Discussion\nIn this study, we identified the pPVT as a key brain structure that mediates the selection of competing defensive strategies, namely Pavlovian freezing and instrumental behavior. These findings add to a growing body of literature that places the PVT as an important regulator of emotional and motivational processes31,32 . Notably, we uncovered that the anatomical and functional segregation of PVT projections to the CeA and the NAc underscores its role in biasing behavioral selection. Collectively, these findings expand on previous studies linking PVT function to passive defensive responses12,22,28,33 , provide a circuit mechanism by which opposing defensive strategies are leveraged8 and support the notion that the PVT is critical for the orchestration of adaptive behavioral responses32,34,35 .\nRecent literature shows that the pPVT is predominantly sensitive to aversive stimuli28,29 . In turn, the pPVT appears to orchestrate adaptive responses that allow animals to cope with ongoing demands36 . Consistent with this view and in addition to its role in driving Pavlovian defensive reactions, the pPVT is now recognized to promote goal-directed instrumental responses, including food seeking, drug seeking and maternal behaviors37-41 . Importantly, some of these studies have directly implicated NAc projections of the pPVT as guiding instrumental behaviors during aversive states38-43 . In light of these recent reports, our finding that the pPVT-NAc pathway also regulates instrumental defensive behaviors suggests that these projections might generally promote goal-directed behaviors. From this perspective, the pPVT-CeA pathway could support behavioral strategies that favor Pavlovian responding irrespective of whether responses are reward oriented or defensive in nature36 . Accordingly, it was recently proposed that pPVT-CeA projections drive morphine-induced conditioned place preference likely through Pavlovian incentive motivation44 .\nThe pPVT is not the only brain region that innervates both the NAc and the CeA. Indeed, the BLA and the insular cortex also send divergent projection to these structures, and these projections have been implicated in emotional and motivational processes14,19,45-47 . Particularly relevant to the present study is the notion that the BLA has been shown to contribute to both conditioned freezing and active avoidance behavior via its projections to the CeA and the NAc, respectively. This leads to the question of what the differential contributions of the BLA and the PVT are to these opposing defensive behaviors. One possibility discussed earlier in this manuscript is that the BLA's contribution to conditioned passive and active defensive behaviors decreases over time20-22 . As such, the PVT might increasingly become the dominant pathway by which freezing and active avoidance behaviors are regulated. Alternatively, and possibly in addition to this time-dependent role, the PVT might serve to contextualize aversive memories by integrating these with information about internal state (owing to its strong innervation by the hypothalamus and the brainstem). Consistent with this idea, the PVT has been recently proposed to arbiter amid motivational conflicts32 . Future studies should aim to identify the precise mechanisms by which the PVT regulates behavior and how these differ from those of other regions known to regulate the same behaviors.\nEmergent studies support the notion that the neuronal circuits of the PVT are functionally diverse31 . Indeed, we recently identified two major classes of PVT neurons that can be distinguished on the basis of genetic, anatomic (connectional) and functional differences29 . Specifically, it was suggested that PVT neuronal subtypes could be identified by their expression, or lack thereof, of the Drd2 gene (and D2R protein). Functionally, compared to D2R-negative PVT neurons, which, at the population level, appear to be modulated by stimulus salience, D2R-expressing neurons are primarily sensitive to aversive stimuli28,29 . Our results expand on this recent report by showing further anatomical and functional heterogeneity among aversive-sensitive pPVTD2R neurons.\nIt is important to note that non-D2R-expressing PVT neurons also project to the NAc and the amygdala29 . However, the contributions of these parallel projections (and how they differ to those of D2R-expressing neurons) to defensive behaviors remain unaddressed. Our findings should encourage future studies to classify PVT neurons based on the intersection of genetic markers and projection target31 , an approach that has led to the discovery of functional segregation in other brain areas48-52 . In addition, implementing imaging techniques with cellular resolution should facilitate the identification of functionally distinct PVT cell types that might have remained undetected in our experiments using bulk imaging approaches from projection-defined neurons.\nThe observation that optogenetic inhibition of pPVT-NAc projections leads to lasting reductions in active avoidance behavior is reminiscent of a previous report demonstrating that silencing pPVT-CeA projections produces similar lasting effects in freezing behavior during fear memory retrieval22 . In that study, the authors concluded that the persistent reduction in freezing behavior indicated an overall role for this pathway in controlling the maintenance of fear memories. Our findings are at odds with this interpretation. Specifically, we found that, although silencing of pPVT-NAc projections reduced active avoidance, it led to a concomitant increase in CS-evoked freezing. As such, our findings do not support a conclusion in which persistent reductions in avoidance behavior resulting from pPVT-NAc silencing are due to deficits in fear memory maintenance. Instead, in light of this previous report and our collective findings, we propose that the activation of pPVT projections to the NAc and the CeA links fear (CS/US) associations to the selection of specific defensive strategies. As such, our findings help remodel current views on the role that the PVT plays in the formation and maintenance of aversive memories. Subsequent studies in this topic should aim at identifying the local and upstream circuit mechanisms that promote behavioral bias.\nA major focus of the present study was to uncover the neural circuit mechanisms by which animals switch between two opposing defensive behaviors: freezing and active avoidance. In nature, animals typically engage in these different defensive behaviors as a function of threat imminence8-10 . From this perspective, active avoidance is thought to have evolved as a way to deal with temporally and spatially distant threats (pre-encounter)53 , whereas freezing behavior and other reactive responses, such as flight, mostly emerge during highly imminent threats (post-encounter and circa-strike)10 . Within this framework, the idea that the 2AA task yields a subset of animals that fail to engage in avoidance behavior (low avoiders) might seem to suggest that this task is not suitable for studying ethologically relevant defensive strategies. However, a potential explanation for the variability in behavioral outcome observed with the current task, particularly the low avoider phenotype, could be that, due to the short duration of the CS (15 s), some animals view the threat (US) as highly imminent and, thus, display freezing behavior when avoidance is possible. Consistent with this notion, a recent study demonstrated that reducing threat imminence by increasing the duration of the CS virtually eliminates low avoiders53 . This study underscores the notion that parameters of the 2AA task (including CS and ITI duration) can be optimized to mimic naturalistic differences in threat imminence. In the current study, we exploited individual differences in animal performance that are harnessed by standard 2AA protocols to obtain information about the mechanisms that mediate switches in defensive behavior strategy. We predict that the circuit mechanisms described in our study for biasing the selection of opposing defensive behaviors mirror those engaged when animals switch defensive strategies as a function of threat imminence. Developing ethologically relevant behavioral models in which animals engage in both pre-encounter (active) and post-encounter reactive defensive modes (for example, freezing) with varying degrees of threat imminence would allow for further exploring the neurobiology of defensive behavior selection. Of note, ethologically relevant behavioral tasks have been recently developed to assess transitions between post-encounter and circa-strike elicited defense54 .",

        "introduction": "Stimulus equivalence research is dominated by operant conditioning procedures that require the active responding of a participant to establish relations between arbitrary stimuli. In comparison, there has been relatively little research using respondent-type procedures, which only require the participant to view relations that appear on screen. This presentation describes two experiments using a respondent-type matching-to-sample procedure to examine the elfect of the one- to-many (OTM) training procedure and the linear procedure on equivalence class formation. The OTM procedure was extremely effective in generating equivalence responding, however the linear procedure was not. These findings are discussed in the context of previous research comparing the two training procedures, as well as the effectiveness of previous respondent procedures.\nKeywords Stimulus equivalence * Respondent-type matching-to-sample procedure * One-to-many * Linear procedure\nIntroduction\nIf one was to choose a random article on stimulus equivalence research that has been published over the last 50 years, chances are the matching-to-sample (MTS) procedure is what was used to establish the relations between arbitrary stimuli (e.g., Pilgrim, 2020). A sample stimulus (Al) is presented along with multiple comparison stimuli (B1, B2, B3, etc.), one of which is deemed by the experimenter to be the correct comparison (in this case Bl). The participant is tasked with selecting the correct comparison stimulus in relation to the sample, with a correct response being reinforced to establish the relation between the two stimuli. Tests for emergent relations then follow to determine whether equivalence classes have been established (Pilgrim, 2020). In contrast, there has been relatively little research that has used respondent conditioning methods to establish equivalence responding (e.g., Brown et al., 2023; Leader et al., 1996). A typical respondent-type (ReT) procedure doesn't require or reinforce selection responses, the participant is simply required to view stimulus pairings that appear on screen; for example, stimulus A1 precedes the appearance of stimulus Bl. Although Leader et al. (1996) and Leader and Barnes-Holmes (2001) found the ReT design to be as effective as the MTS procedure, other research has come to the opposite conclusion. That is, although the ReT procedure can train equivalence relations successfully, it is simply not as effective as the traditional MTS procedure (Clayton & Hayes, 2004). More recent research by Amd et al. (2017) compared the ReT procedure to the MTS procedure as well as a \"stimulus pairing with response (SPresp)\" procedure and a \"stimulus pairing with orientation (SOresp)\" procedure. The SOresp training trials involved presenting a cross in one of the four corners of the screen for each trial, and the participant was tasked with first clicking the cross to initiate the presentation of the stimuli, which appeared in the same corner as the cross. They found this procedure to be the most effective procedure out of the four at establishing transitive relations, including the MTS procedure. These findings suggest that an orientation response, something typically absent in ReT procedures, may be required to facilitate the establishment of emergent relations in ReT procedures.\nMTS procedures are built using different sequences of conditional discriminations, with variations in the presentation and arrangement of the stimuli in relation to each other (Saunders & Green, 1999). These training structures are known as the one-to-many (OTM), linear series and many-to-one (MTO) structures (Plazas & Villamil, 2016). In the context of three-member equivalence classes using an OTM training structure, each equivalence class is established by training each comparison stimulus to a single sample stimulus, typically the A stimulus (e.g., train A-B, followed by A-C). Following training, participants are tested for the emergent relations of symmetry (B-A, C-A) and equivalence (B-C, C-B; Keenan et al., 2015; Delgado & Rodriguez, 2020). Linear structures train relations sequentially by training A to B, followed by training B to C, and then testing for the emergence of relations between the A and C stimuli (Green & Saunders, 1998; Reilly et al., 2005). The third training structure, the MTO structure (Saunders et al., 1993; Hove, 2003) involves training multiple samples to one comparison (e.g., training B-A, followed by training C-A). Research has shown that the potential success of generating equivalence classes is determined by the training structure employed (Saunders & Green, 1999), with the linear structure appearing to be the least effective of the three training structures in terms of establishing the baseline relations required for equivalence responding (Arntzen et al., 2010; Holth & Arntzen, 1998). It is worth noting that research has been divided on whether OTM or MTO are equally effective; Arntzen and Holth (1997) and Arntzen and Nikolaisen (2011) found OTM to be more effective, whereas Saunders et al. (1999) and Hove (2003) came to the opposite conclusion. Amd et al. (2017) also found the OTM procedure to be the most effective procedure, however, this was not to a significant margin.\nA new experimental design by Delgado and Rodriguez (2020), which they termed the respondent matching-to-sample procedure (hereafter known as the respondent-type matching-to-sample procedure, or ReTMTS procedure) combines elements of both designs. Like the traditional ReT procedure, it does not involve overt reinforcement at any point in training. The training trials appear in a similar fashion to the MTS procedure, with a sample stimulus appearing followed by multiple comparison stimuli. Unlike the MTS procedure, however, the participant is simply shown the relation by virtue of a prompt (red boxes appearing around the sample and related comparison). Another difference is the presence of probe/verification trials following each training block of trials to determine whether responding is under the control of the highlighted relations. ReT experiments tend to have the participants progress to the test trials after viewing a set number of trials; the implementation of these probe trials, as well as a strict criterion required for progression through the experiment, makes it possible for the participant to be retrained at the part of the training that they have struggled with, rather than either being retrained from the beginning after failing the test phase, or not being retrained at all. Their study was successful in establishing equivalence responding, however it was conducted only using the OTM procedure, and did not examine how other training structures may affect the effectiveness of the training.\nThe purpose of the present study was to compare OTM and linear training structures using a variation of Delgado and Rodriguez's (2020) procedure to investigate whether the findings on the difference in effectiveness of the two training structures seen in earlier studies (e.g., Arntzen et al., 2010; Smeets et al., 1997) also applied to this experimental design, in regards to both successful establishment of equivalence relations and the amount of exposures to the baseline relations that each participant required in order to progress through the training phase. Experiment 1 used an OTM training structure similar to the original Delgado and Rodriguez (2020) study, whereas Experiment 2 used a linear structure.\nExperiment 1--OTM Structure",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants\nParticipants were 11 nonvulnerable adults over 18 years of age who could use and access a device that was connected to the internet. They were recruited through opportunistic sampling from both inside and outside the student body of Ulster University. There was no incentive to take part in the experiment. Participants read an information sheet and completed a consent form before beginning the experiment proper. All participants for this experiment were recruited online and took part in the experiment remotely.\nSetting and Apparatus\nBy using the online experiment building website \"Gorilla\" (http://www.gorilla.se; Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2019), the study could be conducted on desktop computers, laptops, and handheld smart devices like iPads or smartphones. The dimensions of the stimuli described here are given in the context of a 32 * 20.5cm laptop screen. The stimuli used in the task consisted of bold black Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Japanese Katakana letters presented against a white background (Fig. 1). Note that the stimuli were similar to the stimuli used by Delgado and Rodriguez (2020). The participants were not asked if they were familiar with the stimuli before beginning the experiment.\nPhase 1. A-B Training and Probe Trials\nAfter participants gave their consent to take part, they were taken to Phase 1 in which A-B relations were trained. On screen, they were presented with the instructions:\nThe instructions presented in this experiment were identical to the instructions used by Delgado and Rodriguez (2020) and were presented on the device the participant was using. The trials were presented sequentially in order of class; 4 A1-B1 trials were presented first, followed by 4 A2-B2 trials, and then 4 A3-B3 trials, for a total of 12 A-B training trials. For each training trial, at first, the sample stimulus (A; 1.5 cm tall and 1.5 cm wide) was first presented alone at the top center of the screen (7.2 cm from the top of the screen, 11.5 cm from the bottom and 15.5 cm from each side of the screen). After 2 s, the comparison stimuli (B1, B2, and B3) appeared in a line 6.3 cm below the sample stimulus. One comparison appeared directly below the sample, with the other two comparisons 5 cm to the left and right of the center comparisons. The left and right comparisons were both 10.7 cm away from their respective side of the screen, and the center comparison was 15.5 cm away from both edges. The comparison stimuli were each 0.6 cm tall by 0.6 cm wide (smaller than the sample stimulus) and appeared 5.3 cm from the bottom of the screen. After another 2 s had passed, red boxes appeared around the sample stimulus and the related comparison stimulus. For example, if A1 was the sample, red boxes would appear around it and Bl. The red box that appeared around the sample stimuli was 6.2 cm wide and 4.5 cm tall, with a line thickness of 0.2 cm. The center of the sample stimulus was 3 cm from the sides of the red box, and 2 cm from the top and bottom of the red box. The comparison stimuli red box that appeared was 3.6 cm by 2.6 cm, with a 0.1 cm thickness. The comparison stimuli were 1.7 cm from the sides, and 1.2 cm from the top and bottom of the red boxes. This screen with all the stimuli remained for 3 s before being followed by the inter-trial interval (ITI), a white screen. After 2 s, the next training trial began, following the same sequence as above (Fig. 2 illustrates this sequence below).\nFollowing the presentation of the training trials, new instructions were given to the participant:\nThe participants were presented with a screen containing the sample and comparison stimuli in a similar arrangement to the training trials, albeit with no red boxes. A major difference was that the comparison stimuli now had grey borders as they were now \"buttons\" for the participant to interact with (see Fig. 3). The grey borders were 3.6cm wide by 2.6 cm tall, with rounded edges and a thickness of less than 0.1 cm. Clicking on any of the comparison stimuli progressed the experiment to the next trial. As in the training trials, the probe trials were presented sequentially by class. After six probes (two for each class), participants who demonstrated 100% accurate responding progressed to Phase 2, whereas those who did not meet this criterion were taken to the start of a shortened version of Phase 1 for retraining. Retraining involved viewing a block of nine training trials (three per class) and then once again completing the same six probe trials. Failure to successfully answer all six probe trials after a second retraining session resulted in the experiment concluding, followed by debriefing. Participants were presented with a screen displaying \"Well Done\" after answering the six probe trials regardless of performance.\nPhase 2. A-C Training and Probe Trials\nThe procedure for Phase 2 was identical to the procedure of the previous phase, except that this phase trained relations between the A and C stimuli. A notable difference between this phase and Phase 1 was that participants did not receive instructions before beginning this test phase. This was due to an error, as participants were meant to see the same instructions that were presented for Phase 1. In Experiment 2, this error is corrected. Once again, advancement to the next phase of the experiment was contingent on participants achieving 100% mastery of the relation being trained.\nPhase 3. Mixed A-B and A-C Training and Probe Trials\nAgain, the procedure for this phase was identical to the previous phases, with the exception of the presence of both A-B and A-C training trials in this phase, and the presence of 12 probe trials in this phase instead of just 6. Advancement to the final test phase of the experiment relied on the participant demonstrating 92% accurate responding in the probe trials in this phase. Failure to meet this criterion resulted in the participant being retrained, like in the other phases. Retraining cycles in this phase contained 12 training trials, instead of 9. Again, participants did not receive instructions at the beginning of this phase.\nPhase 4. Test for Emergent Relations\nUpon reaching this phase, participants were informed that they had reached the final test trial phase and were to try the trials that followed. Participants were presented with 36 test trials divided into four 9-trial (three test trials per class) blocks, each block testing for a different emergent relation. The first test block tested for B-A symmetry, the second tested for C-A symmetry, the third tested for B-C equivalence and the fourth C-B equivalence relations. To display successful equivalence class formation, 90% accurate responding had to be demonstrated in each of the four test blocks (eight of the nine trials in each block); participants completed all four test blocks regardless of below criterion performance in one or multiple blocks. Once the participants completed the final test block, they were debriefed, and the experiment was concluded.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThirteen participants were recruited from the student body of Ulster University through opportunistic sampling and use of the university's online participant pool known as SONA. Participants recruited through SONA did receive an incentive to take part in this experiment in the form of course credit, whereas those recruited through opportunistic sampling did not receive any incentive, as in Experiment 1. Participants once again received an information sheet and completed a consent form prior to beginning the experiment. Although the first four participants were recruited through SONA and took part in the experiment remotely, the remaining nine participants completed the experiment within an experimental suite on the university campus. However, these participants took part in the experiment on their own devices rather than using a device provided by the researchers. The dimensions of the experimental suite are given below.\nSetting and Apparatus\nAs Experiment 2 was also hosted on \"Gorilla\" (http://www. gorilla.se; Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2019), the setting and apparatus was the same as described in Experiment 1. The stimuli used were also the same as the stimuli used in Experiment 1. The dimensions for the experimental suite were as follows: the room was 230 cm by 230 cm, containing a desk 140 cm wide by 60 cm tall and a chair. The desk had a computer on it; however, it was not switched on and the participant was directed to sit away from it by where the QR code was set on the desk. Participants sat with their backs approximately 130 cm from the door, and approximately 40 cm from the desk. The QR code sheet displayed the QR code, along with the university's logo, name of the study and names of the researchers. It also contained basic information on the study that was also provided in the information sheet, specifically the length of time the study took to complete and that it could be completed on any device.\nProcedure\nExperiment 2 used a linear training structure, meaning that A-B and B-C relations were established in this experiment, and meant that the B stimuli were presented as the sample stimuli for B-C training trials. Phase 1 was identical to the same phase of the Experiment 1, whereas Phase 2 trained and established B-C relations. Phase 3 presented participants with a mix of A-B and B-C training trials, and Phase 4 tested for A-B and C-B symmetry A-C transitivity and the equivalence relation of C-A. The error with the instructions in Experiment 1 was corrected in this experiment; participants saw the same instructions before each training phase. The wording of the test phase instructions was also changed and tells the participant that now that they have learnt which symbols go together to try the following trials. Although they were still informed that this was the final phase, they were not explicitly informed that was a test phase like in Experiment 1.",

        "results": "Results and Discussion\nTable 1 displays the number of training trials in each training phase for participants who successfully reached Phase 4 of Experiment 1. With the exception of P5, all participants successfully reached Phase 4 having been exposed to 36 training trials. P5 was retrained twice, unsuccessfully, in the first phase, meaning they were only exposed to 30 A-B training trials (nine extra trials per retraining block) before the experiment was concluded for them. Of the remaining 10 participants, only 2 participants required retraining at some point in the experiment. P3 and P11 were both retrained once in Phase 2, and as a result were exposed to 45 training trials in total.\nTable 2 shows the participants' performances in the four tests for derived relations in Phase 4. The criteria for demonstrating successful generating of the three equivalence classes was at least 90% accurate responding in each of the test blocks (eight out of nine trials answered correctly) All the participants who reached Phase 4 met the criterion required to demonstrate successful equivalence class formation. Seven of these participants completed the phase errorless (100% correct responding in each block), with the other three participants each having made a single error at one point in the phase.\nThe objective of this experiment was to investigate the effectiveness of the ReTMTS procedure with a OTM training structure. With the exception of a single participant, all participants successfully displayed equivalence responding across the three classes. These findings concur with those of Delgado and Rodriguez (2020) who also used the OTM structure with the ReTMTS procedure and found that the majority of their participants were able to successfully demonstrate equivalence responding across all three classes. In fact, the current experiment was arguably more successful than the findings of Delgado and Rodriguez (2020) where only 68% of participants met the criterion for equivalence responding.\nGiven the extremely high success rate of this procedure, it was decided to conduct an experiment with the same procedure but with a linear training structure (and with errors rectified), to see if the training structure would have an impact on both the establishment of the initial baseline relations, and the establishment of equivalence relations.\nExperiment 2--Linear Structure\nThis experiment investigated if using a linear training structure (i.e., train A-B and B-C) in the ReTMTS procedure had an influence on the successful establishment of relations between the stimuli and subsequent equivalence class formation.\nResults and Discussion\nTable 3 showcases the number of training trials each participant was exposed to across Experiment 2's three training phases, again omitting the results of the participants who did not meet criterion to progress to the test phase. P18 and P19 both did not reach the test phase, with P18 being unsuccessfully retrained twice in Phase 2 and P19 was trained unsuccessfully in Phase 1. Of the remaining 11 participants, 5 progressed to Phase 4 with no retraining having taken place. Three participants (P16, P22, and P24) were retrained once at one point in the three training phases, P16 and P22 were both only retrained once in Phase 2, and were exposed to 45 training trials in total, whereas P24 was retrained once in Phase 3, the only participant to require retraining in this phase. This resulted in P24 being exposed to a total of 48 training trials, as retraining cycles in Phase 3 contain 12 training trials. The remaining three participants were each retrained twice in one of the three training phases (P14 and P21 were exposed to two retraining cycles in Phase 1, whereas P15 was successfully retrained twice in Phase 2), resulting in the three participants being exposed to 54 training trials.\nTable 4 displays the scores the participants obtained in each of the test blocks in Phase 4 of Experiment 2. Like in Experiment 1, at least 90% accurate responding in each test block was required to demonstrate successful generation of the equivalence classes. Three of the participants met this criteria (P12 doing so errorless), the remaining eight did not. P15, P17, and P22 were all one correct responses below criterion, having responded above criterion in all but one of the test blocks. The number of correct responses in each of the test blocks among the other unsuccessful participants varied. It should be noted that both P14 and P20 made no correct responses in the A-C transitivity test block yet made met criterion in the subsequent C-A equivalence block.\nThe goal of Experiment 2 was to investigate whether the ReTMTS procedure would be effective when it was employed with a linear training structure. The results above show there was a much higher level of variation in responding within the participants compared to the participants who were exposed to the OTM structure in Experiment 1. Only 3 of the 11 participants (27%) who reached the test phase met the criterion to display equivalence responding across the three classes. These findings agree with the literature regarding the linear structure being the least effective structure when it comes to establishing equivalence responding. Of note, regarding the fact that the first four participants completed the experiment remotely, the data displayed above does not appear to show any significant difference between the results of the remote participants and the participants is completed the experiment on campus.",
        "limitations": "",
        "discussion": "General Discussion\nThe objective of this study was to compare the effects of two respondent-type matching-to-sample (ReTMTS) experiments, one with a one-to-many (OTM) training structure and another with a Linear structure. Compared to the OTM procedure, the linear procedure was much less effective at both the initial establishment of the baseline relations and the establishment of the subsequent emergent relations. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 below.\nThese findings are in line with previous research on training structures conducted using operant procedures (Arntzen et al., 2010), but not in line with the findings of respondent-type (ReT) literature, which found the three structures to be equally effective when tested with preschool children (Leader et al., 2000; Smeets et al., 1997). However, it is worth mentioning that the results of the first experiment by Smeets et al. (1997), which examined the effectiveness of MTO and OTM training structures in a respondent-type procedure, alongside the results of Condition 2 (linear) in Leader et al. (1996), provided limited evidence that the OTM was more effective than the linear structure (the OTM being, in turn, less effective than the MTO procedure). These two experiments were conducted with adult participants, as was the present study. The current findings also concur with the findings of Kinloch et al. (2013), who compared the effectiveness of the MTS procedure and the stimulus pairing observation procedure (SPOP, another term for the ReT procedure) as well as the different training structures, also conducted with adult participants, found the OTM to be the most effective compared to both the MTO and linear structures with both procedures. They also found the MTS procedure to be marginally more effective than the SPOP procedure.\nRegarding the relative ineffectiveness of the linear procedure, Fields et al. (1984) theorized that nodal distance was primarily responsible. They felt that the larger the distance between stimuli indirectly linked through training, the less robust the procedure is at subsequently establishing equivalence relations. What this means in the context of Experiment 2 is that the nodal distance between stimuli A and C is larger than the nodal distances of all the other relations in Experiment 1, resulting in less instances of successful equivalence responding. Saunders and Green (1999) disagreed with this analysis of nodal distance effects and hypothesized that the number of simple discriminations embedded in the training structures was more important. Simple discriminations refer to when responding occurs in the presence of S+ but not in the presence of S- and can be either simultaneous (such as discriminating between comparisons) or successive (discriminating between samples). They felt that as linear structures do not present all possible simultaneous discriminations during where a single error was made is represented by the color blue. The gray color represents performance below criterion where participants made more than one error in the test block. Note that Experiment 2 tested one more participant than Experiment 1 training, a higher failure rate during testing is then to be expected when using this procedure. In fact, they stated that the only structure to present all simple discriminations during training that are required for the emergence of equivalence relations was the MTO structure. The OTM procedure, not allowing for a simple discrimination to occur between the B and C stimuli, is subsequently less likely to be successful compared to the MTO. However, all participants tested in Experiment 1 displayed equivalence responding. This finding suggests that a future experiment comparing OTM and MTO structures should be conducted with the procedures outlined here.\nIt is notable that almost all the participants who took part in OTM procedure were able to reach the test phase in 36 training trials, the minimum amount of training required. This suggests that the OTM ReTMTS experiment was successful in establishing the baseline relations with exposures to only the minimum amount of training trials. In comparison, 7 of the 19 participants tested by Delgado and Rodriguez (2020), also using an OTM structure, required exposure to the minimum amount of training trials, the remaining participants requiring retraining. A potential reason for this difference could be the fact that the training phases in the current study presented both the training and probe trials sequentially (as in, four A1-B1 training trials followed by four A2-B2 trials and then four A3-B3 trials) rather than having them presented semi-randomly as in the Delgado and Rodriguez's (2020) study. It was only during Phase 4 that the trials were presented in a semi-random order. It is possible that the repeated pairings of the same stimuli in one block, perhaps in essence giving the participant more time to view the pairing before seeing the next pair of related stimuli, was a key factor in making the training more effective in establishing the baseline relations.\nThe presence of the probe trials appeared to facilitate the establishment of equivalence relations in both experiments, though to different degrees, presumably due to the differences of training structures. Another aspect that demonstrates the probe trials importance to the current procedure is the fact that equivalence responding can be reliably established with the ReTMTS procedure (most notably with the OTM structure) in as little as 36 training trials. This is quite a low number of training trials (indeed, it is only 18 trials per relation across the three training phases) compared to both ReT procedures and MTS procedures. For example, in Leader et al. (1996), 60 ReT training trials were presented, with each individual relation (Al-Bl, B1-C1, A2-B2, B2-C2, A3-B3, B3-C3) presented 10 times. In comparison, each individual relation was only presented six times in each experiment, four in either Phases 1 or 2, and twice in Phase 3, not counting retraining. For a recent MTS example, Keenan et al. (2020) presented each individual baseline relation (A1-B1 etc.) 12 times for a total of 48 trials (without retraining). The inclusion of the probe trials, and the apparent requirement of their presence to establish equivalence responding, raises an interesting point, especially in regard to the ReT training component of this procedure. However, the relative contribution of operant and respondent components is not clear. From a respondent perspective, participants were exposed to more training trials than probe trials during training, and they did not receive any feedback for their responses beyond the presentation of the next trial and progression through the experiment (and a \"Well done\" regardless of performance). On the other hand, the probe trials appear to be necessary for the experiment to be more successful, by at the very least allowing for retraining of an individual relation to occur. However, the selection of B1 in the presence of A1 in the probe trials did not involve any feedback for a correct response. At the very least, it can be concluded that the participants should be given the option to demonstrate mastery of the baseline relations during training, in order to guarantee that the participants are entering the test phase with responding under the control of the relations highlighted by the training trials. It is also worth noting that this is not the only example of a ReT procedure introducing responding during training. Carnerero et al. (2019) also implemented probe trials following the ReT training of a relation. Amd et al. (2017), although not implementing responding in order to demonstrate mastery of the relations, did implement an orienteering response before each training trial was presented. Their findings, mentioned in the introduction above regarding the stimulus pairing with orientating procedure (SOresp), suggest that an orientation response in a ReT procedure is required to guarantee consistent success in the ReT procedure. Although an orientating response is not required in the current procedure, the participants are still required to orientate to the appropriate comparison stimuli during training.\nTwo of the participants were unable to respond correctly to any of the A-C transitivity trials in Phase 4 in Experiment 2. Despite this, both participants subsequentially met criterion in the C-A equivalence block. In fact, P20 met criterion in all blocks except the transitivity block. Perhaps Stimulus Control Topography Coherence Theory (SCTCT; Dube & Mcllvane, 1996; Fields & Paone, 2020; Mcllvane & Dube, 2003) may account for these results. Stimulus Control Topography refers to the differences between the stimuli in a class, such as their physical features, and their controlling properties, and these different control topographies may control the same measured response. SCTCT refers to the coherency between the experimenter defined stimuli that control behavior and the stimuli that actually gain control of the participant's behavior. For example, in the current study a participant might select B1 in the presence of A1 in a probe trial because of the control of the red box prompts during training, but in the next trial may select B1 in the presence of A1 because of the physical space B1 inhabits in this particular probe trial. It appears that the current study, and by extension the ReTMTS procedure in general, seems to display high levels of experimenter-defined stimulus control. The results of Experiment 1 attest to that due to the consistently accurate responding displayed by all participants in the emergent relations test phase. Indeed, even in Experiment 2 high levels of accurate responding are seen, however, there is much greater variation in the correct responses across the test blocks. That being said, what caused the failure of the emergence of transitivity in two participants who were still able to display the emergence of equivalence? Possibly it was the position of the stimuli on the screen. Apart from the training phases, the transitivity block was the first time that the C stimuli were presented as comparisons and the A stimuli as samples, when prior to that in the symmetry test blocks the A stimuli were presented as comparisons and the C stimuli as samples. Limited evidence to suggest that this physical placement of stimuli on screen was controlling responding may possibly be found in the results of P23, who, despite not reaching criterion overall, responded somewhat accurately in the first symmetry block and the final equivalence block, which both presented the A stimuli as comparisons, compared to the other test blocks. Tonneau et al. (2006) found something similar, with transfer of function effects occurring between stimuli depending on shared stimulus correlations, such as their location on screen.\nAnother potential reason could be that the physical shape of the stimuli, especially the C stimuli, affected control in some way, and rendered the experimenter-defined relations between the C stimuli and the other class members weak. From a cursory glance, the C stimuli do appear to be more physically different compared to the A and B stimuli. They are more complicated shapes and in the case of Cl and C3 are made up of more than one line. Perhaps the complicated shape made it much more difficult for the participants to respond accurately when the C stimuli were presented together as comparisons, as this resulted in the participants struggling to differentiate between the three compared to when they were presented alone as samples. Clayton and Hayes (2004) used similarly complex Chinese characters in two of their experiments (albeit all their stimuli where from this alphabet, rather than each member of the class belonging to a different alphabet). It was felt that these stimuli were less nameable and therefore less likely to facilitate establishment of equivalence responding compared to their more \"nameable\" counterparts. Perhaps this also occurred here, with the C stimuli, being less nameable than the A or B counterparts. It is also possible that this an example of delayed emergence of equivalence (Holth & Arntzen, 1998; Sidman, 1994). Delayed emergence is a phenomena reported in equivalence literature that is showcased by an increase in accurate responding as a result of continued testing (Arntzen & Mensah, 2020). In short, these participants, although scoring very low in the transitivity block (selecting C in the presence of A), were effectively trained in this block, in the absence of feedback or overt displays of the defined relations, to respond accurately in the equivalence block (selecting A in the presence of C). It should be reiterated, however, that the OTM procedure produced consistent accurate responding across all four test blocks compared to the linear experiment.\nThe findings reported here in regard to the use of the respondent-type matching-to-sample procedure agree with the research of Hayes (1992), Tonneau (2001, 2002) and Minster et al. (2011), who all suggested that emergent relations are influenced more by respondent-type relations, also known as stimulus pairings/correlations, than they are influenced by reinforcement contingencies established by the operant procedures more commonly used in the wider literature. These findings challenge the traditional view that stimulus equivalence is a direct result of operant contingencies, specifically reinforcement of correct responses during training (Delgado & Hayes, 2013). Tonneau (2001) suggested that functional equivalence is derived from what he called stimulus correlations and argued for a shift away from MTS procedures to stimulus correlations. He considered that the origins of symbolic behavior lay in transfer of function across stimuli that was established by stimulus pairings that were sensitive to the effects of operant feedback. In short, function transfer within MTS experiments occurs due to the stimulus pairings implicit in the MTS procedure, not through the actual matching-to-sample procedure itself. The behavioral effects of a stimulus (such as a selecting behavior) transfer between members of an equivalence class when they have been temporally, and directly or indirectly, paired (Tonneau, 2001). For example, Minster et al. (2011) were able to establish three 5-member equivalence classes despite two members of each class having an established history of extinction. The current procedures simply demonstrated that the appearance of red boxes around the related sample and comparison stimuli (which were required to highlight the relation between the two stimuli), along with the probe trials that did not provide feedback, was sufficient to establish the relations between the stimuli. The red boxes function as orienting stimuli, which is a respondent process, albeit one that has required a prior learning history to establish that boxes around the two stimuli signify a relation between them. This learning history is established both by the instructions of the experiment (which explicitly refer to stimuli \"going together\") and the wider environment of the participant where similar stimuli function to draw attention to certain objects (such as signs and labels). Perhaps the red boxes also function as a shared stimulus feature that is delayed in its appearance, and simply function as an extension of the stimulus-pairing procedure.\nTo conclude, the findings reported here demonstrate that the respondent-type matching-to-sample procedure is effective at establishing equivalence responding, with the one-tomany training structure being much more effective at doing so than the linear structure. Perhaps with more exposures to the baseline relations, the effectiveness of the linear structure would increase. Although the current study cannot speak to the procedure's effectiveness in comparison to the typical MTS procedure (as in Kinloch et al., 2013; and this should certainly be the basis of a future experiment, alongside an experiment comparing the current procedure to the ReT procedure), the fact remains that the respondent contingencies arranged by the ReTMTS procedures used here were able to successfully establish equivalence responding. However, relational frame theory (RFT) and naming theory may suggest other contingencies at play, such as contextual control or that respondent-type relations rely on an operant process such as relation framing or verbal behavior (Barnes, 1994; Horne & Lowe, 1996). Although these contingencies were unfortunately not fully addressed in the current procedures (such as the training instructions explicitly informing the participant the stimuli were to be related), the fact remains that equivalence responding was reliably established in Experiment 1 using a procedure that appears to involve mostly respondent contingencies.\nFunding No funding was received for conducting this study.\nData Availability The datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nDeclarations This research was conducted in partial fulfilment of the first author's self-funded PhD in psychology under the supervision of Mickey Keenan and Stephen Gallagher at Ulster University.

        "introduction": "The present study was conducted to investigate whether the smell and sight of coffee (without tasting it) induced a conditioned response, and to compare the effect of the smell and sight of coffee in high- and low-consumption coffee drinkers. If classical conditioning caused the reduced reaction time effect, it was predicted that the degree of effect of caffeine-related stimuli would depend on the degree of experience of the pairing of conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US). Sixty-six undergraduate students were randomly allocated to either a coffee or water presentation group and completed a simple reaction time task. Linear mixed modeling revealed that years of coffee consumption predicted reaction time when participants were presented coffee. The result coincided with the prediction that the greater the degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US, the greater the conditioned response would be. In conclusion, the present study showed that the smell and sight of coffee (without tasting it) induced a conditioned response and the direction was that of a caffeine-like effect. At least in behavioral effect, different types of caffeine CS uniformly induce a caffeine-like effect. Future studies should investigate the effect of the smell \"or\" sight of coffee to determine the relationship between CS type and direction of response.\nAuthor(s): Mina Fukuda 1\nAuthor Affiliations:\n(1) grid.412021.4, 0000 0004 1769 5590, Department of Psychological Sciences, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, , 1757 Kanazawa, Tobetsu-cho, 061-0293, Ishikari-gun, Hokkaido, Japan\nIntroduction\nCaffeine consumption induces various subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects (see review: Nehlig 2010; Smith 2002). For example, caffeine consumption increased subjective alertness (e.g., Bonnet et al. 1995; Haskell et al. 2005; Johnson et al. 1990; Lieberman et al. 2002; Leathwood and Pollet 1982; Rusted 1994; Smith et al. 1992; Smith et al. 1993; Smith et al. 1994a; Smith et al. 1994b; Smith et al. 1997; Warburton 1995). Many studies have shown that caffeine consumption shortens simple reaction time (e.g., Attwood et al. 2010; Clubley et al. 1979) and choice reaction time (Durlach et al. 2002; Smith et al. 1997; Lieberman et al. 1987; Roache and Griffiths 1987). In addition, caffeine consumption has been found to affect sleep latency (e.g. Zwyghuizen-Doorenbos et al. 1990) and duration (Hicks et al. 1983).\nSome studies have found that a neutral stimulus can become associated with a drug (e.g., Attwood et al. 2010; Birak et al. 2011; Dafters and Anderson 1982; Shapiro and Nathan 1986; Staiger and White 1988), and several studies have also shown that the taste, smell, and sight of the drug (e.g., decaffeinated coffee, non-alcoholic drink) can acquire the properties of a conditioned stimulus (CS) even though acquisition trials were not conducted in these studies (e.g., Adan et al. 2008; Andrews et al. 1998; Flaten et al. 2003; Flaten and Blumenthal 1999; Fukuda and Aoyama 2017; Fukuda et al. 2014; Marczinski and Fillmore 2005; Mikalsen et al. 2001; Newlin 1989; Remington et al. 1997; Rozin et al. 1984; Zwyghuizen-Doorenbos et al. 1990).\nA conditioned response can occur in either of two directions. A response that runs counter to that associated with a given drug is known as a conditioned compensatory response (CCR; Siegel 1975), which is a type of conditioned response (CR). In other words, a stimulus paired with a drug can induce a drug-opposite effect. Other studies using caffeine as an unconditioned stimulus (US) have demonstrated a CCR similar to that found by Rozin et al. (1984). On the other hand, some studies have reported that a caffeine-related stimulus induced a caffeine-like effect (e.g., Adan et al. 2008; Andrews et al. 1998; Attwood et al. 2010; Flaten et al. 2003; Flaten and Blumenthal 1999; Fukuda and Aoyama 2017; Fukuda et al. 2014; Zwyghuizen-Doorenbos et al. 1990). Therefore, a caffeine CS can induce either a caffeine-like or a caffeine-opposite effect. According to Staiger and White (1988), in an alcohol study, it is the nature of the stimuli that determines the direction of the response (i.e., an alcohol-like response is determined by a drink CS, whereas an alcohol-opposite response is determined by a room CS or a drink + room CS).\nIn human classical conditioning, a conditioning procedure (i.e., the pairing of a CS and a US) and other factors (e.g., verbal information) are the sources of learning (e.g., Stewart-Williams and Podd 2004). Most previous studies have used drink CS (the taste, smell, and sight of coffee) and provided verbal information such as participants being told that their drink is decaffeinated (e.g., Adan et al. 2008; Andrews et al. 1998; Flaten et al. 2003; Flaten and Blumenthal 1999; Fukuda and Aoyama 2017; Zwyghuizen-Doorenbos et al. 1990). However, verbal information may distort the effect of CS. Therefore, the present study used the smell and sight of coffee (without tasting it) CS to determine the effect of conditioning procedure by itself. Participants were presented with coffee on a desk with no instruction about the content of caffeine. A clarification of the effect of CS by itself may reveal the direction of the conditioned response.\nThe present study was conducted to investigate whether the smell and sight of coffee (without tasting it) induced a conditioned response. Moreover, this study attempted to compare the effect of the smell and sight of coffee in high- and low-consumption coffee drinkers. If classical conditioning caused the reduced reaction time effect, it was predicted that the degree of the effect of caffeine-related stimuli would depend on the degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US. From the principle of classical conditioning, caffeine-related stimuli induce a caffeine-like effect in habitual coffee drinkers. Moreover, the degree of caffeine-like effect may be greater when the number of times that the smell and sight of coffee (conditioned stimulus) have been paired with caffeine (unconditioned stimulus) is high. That is, in high-consumption coffee drinkers, the degree of conditioned response would be large (and vice versa). As demonstrated in many studies (that investigated the behavioral effect of caffeine) that determined that caffeine induces a shortened simple reaction time effect (e.g., Clubley et al. 1979; Nehlig 2010; Smith 2002), this study also used a simple reaction time task to measure conditioned response.",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants\nThe 66 participants (13 men, 53 women) were undergraduate students. Participants were asked to abstain from caffeinated drinks (e.g., coffee, energy drinks) for two hours before the testing. The abstinence time was established based on a previous study that investigated the effects of decaffeinated coffee (Dawkins et al. 2011). However, the median abstinence time was 45.42 h, and most participants abstained approximately 12 h. This is consistent with previous research that established more severe abstinence periods (the evening before testing; e.g., Elliman et al. 2010). Therefore, this study had sufficient abstinence time. The participants were randomly allocated to either a coffee presentation (C group; n = 36) or a water presentation (W group; n = 30) group.\nMaterials\nA coffee maker and a glass pitcher (for the C group) or bottled water and a glass pot (for the W group) were present on a desk. In the C group, the coffee was brewed in a \"Nescafe Gold Blend\" (Nestle Japan Limited) coffee maker. This coffee was used in a previous study (Fukuda et al. 2014). The participants were presented with the smell and sight of coffee in the coffee maker and the glass pot. In the W group, bottled water (Suntory Beverage & Food Limited) and water in the glass pot were presented to the participants.\nQuestionnaire\nThe questionnaire, which the participants filled out after the task, assessed subjective rating during the task and participants' characteristics. The subjective rating assessed arousal during the simple reaction time (SRT) task retrospectively. The subjective rating was provided using 100 mm visual analog scales with the anchors being not at all and extremely . The question items regarding participants' characteristics related to the following: age, gender, the time and amount of coffee last consumed, frequency of coffee consumption (times/month), usual coffee consumption (ml; an example: canned coffee = 180 ml), and number of years of coffee consumption.\nSRT Task\nThe participants completed an SRT task (Attwood et al. 2010; Fukuda and Aoyama 2017). In this task, a stimulus (asterisk) was presented in the middle of the computer screen. The participants pressed the space key as quickly as possible when the stimulus was presented. If the participants pressed the key or the stimulus was presented for up to 1 s, the stimulus disappeared. The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) varied randomly between 1 and 2.5 s. This task consisted of 10 practice trials (before pre-session) and 100 test trials (pre-session and post-sessions 1, 2, and 3). Each session of the task took about 5 min. The task was programmed in SuperLab 4.5 (Cedrus Corporation).\nProcedure\nThe experiment was conducted in May 2017. The entire procedure took about 30 min. Students from a psychology class at Doshisha University were recruited for this study. All participants provided written informed consent. First, the SRT task was explained (10 practice trials were conducted), and participants completed the SRT task (pre-session, 100 trials) in the first room, which did not have a coffee maker or a glass pot. Then, the participants went to the next room, wherein a coffee maker and a glass pot (for the C group) or bottled water and a glass pot (for the W group) were present on a desk. The reason for using two experimental rooms was to avoid participants being exposed to caffeine-associated stimuli during the pre-session. The participants were asked to pour coffee (in the C group) or water (in the W group) into a cup from the glass pot. The cup was placed beside the computer. Then, the participants completed the SRT task three times (post-sessions 1, 2, and 3, 100 trials each) on this computer. The participants had a one-minute break between the sessions. They were not permitted to drink the coffee or water in the cup during the experiment. After post-session 3, the participants returned to the first room and filled out the questionnaire. After completing the experiment, participants were compensated with course credits.",

Because the repeated pairing of CS and US causes CR, frequency and years of coffee consumption (presumably the number of times of pairing) were used as the predictors. Outcome variables were reaction times in post-sessions 1, 2, and 3. Models included presentation group (water vs coffee; between-subjects), test number (post-sessions 1, 2, 3; repeated measure), frequency of coffee consumption (continuous variable), years of coffee consumption (continuous variable), and pre-reaction time (continuous variable) as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect.\nAs predicted, the Group x Years of coffee consumption interaction was significant (see Table 3). That is, the longer the years of coffee consumption, the shorter the reaction time in the C group (B = -345.41). On the other hand, the Group x Frequency of coffee consumption and the Group x Frequency x Years of coffee consumption interactions were not significant. That is, only years of coffee consumption predicts reaction time when participants are presented coffee. Therefore, years of coffee consumption is used as a predictor variable in the analysis below.

        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe present study was conducted to investigate the smell and sight of coffee (without tasting it) induced conditioned response. Moreover, this study also attempted to compare the effect of the smell and sight of coffee in high- and low-consumption coffee drinkers. If classical conditioning caused the reduced reaction time effect, it was predicted that the degree of the effect of caffeine-related stimuli would depend on the degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US. In the reaction time results, years of coffee consumption predicted reaction time when participants were presented coffee. On the other hand, in the subjective arousal results, the group-related effects were not significant.\nThe reaction time results coincided with the prediction that the greater the degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US, the greater the conditioned response would be. However, the predictor of reaction time was only the years of coffee consumption. Why did no other experience measures predict reaction time? The degree of conditioned response may depend on long-term learning (years of consumption) rather than short-term learning (frequency of coffee consumption per month). This result suggests that the shortened reaction time effect only occurs when the degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US is high.\nThe subjective arousal result did not coincide with the prediction that the greater the degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US, the greater the conditioned response would be. Many studies have shown that caffeine increases subjective arousal (Adan et al. 2008; Barmack 1940; Flaten et al. 2003; McLellan et al. 2016; Nehlig 2010; Peeling and Dawson 2007; Quinlan et al. 2000; Smit and Rogers 2000; Smith 2002). Moreover, some studies have found that caffeine-related stimuli increased subjective arousal (Adan et al. 2008; Flaten and Blumenthal 1999; Mikalsen et al. 2001). On the other hand, a previous study showed no significant difference in subjective arousal between the decaffeinated coffee and water groups (Fukuda and Aoyama 2017). Previous studies used a double-blind design (participants were not told that the drink was decaffeinated coffee). On the other hand, Fukuda and Aoyama (2017) and the present study used an open-label trial (either the participants knew the type of drink or they did not drink any beverage). Perhaps, since previous studies used a double-blind design, the expectancy effect of caffeine induced arousal in the participants.\nIn conclusion, the present study showed that the smell and sight of coffee (without tasting it) induced a conditioned response and the direction of this response was a caffeine-like effect. At least in behavioral effect, caffeine CS with any verbal information (including no information) uniformly induces a caffeine-like effect. Future study should investigate the effect of the smell \"or\" sight of coffee to determine the relationship between CS type and direction of response.\nMoreover, the present study is the first to investigate the relationship between years of coffee consumption (estimated degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US) and conditioned response. Previous studies have conducted experimental acquisition trials and have shown this relationship (caffeine study: Zwyghuizen-Doorenbos et al. 1990; alcohol study: Birak et al. 2011; Dafters and Anderson 1982). However, the present study suggests that longtime coffee drinkers may present a strong conditioned response to caffeine-related stimuli.\nTherefore, perhaps, decaffeinated coffee may also improve further performance in longtime coffee drinkers. Decaffeinated coffee could be effective for people who do not wish to ingest caffeine but still want a caffeine-like effect to improve performance. However, decaffeinated coffee could have a negative effect for people who do not wish to obtain a caffeine-like effect (e.g., loss of sleep) in the night.\nFinally, this study had several limitations. First, further research should investigate the mechanisms of the conditioned response to a caffeine-associated stimulus. Previous research that examined such a response to caffeine did not provide any hypotheses regarding the neural mechanisms behind the conditioned response (e.g. Attwood et al. 2010). It is known that caffeine stimulates the autonomic nervous system (Zahn and Rapoport 1987). Hence, it is possible that the caffeine-associated stimuli may produce an effect of heightened attention and/or improved responsiveness. Second, subjective arousal was measured only at the end of the experiment because subjective arousal was a supplementary measure. The subjective effect of caffeine-related stimuli should be further considered in future research. Moreover, arousal should be investigated from many directions. For example, skin-galvanization response is a more accurate measure of arousal than self-report. Further study should measure arousal using both subjective and physiological methods. Third, a more accurate measurement of coffee consumption should be considered in further research. For example, participants keeping a diary about coffee consumption for several weeks might help clarify participants' coffee consumption. Fourth, it is possible that the effect of coffee presentation did not result from classical conditioning. For example, perhaps participants in the coffee group with high coffee consumption responded faster simply because they found stimuli related to coffee innately improving performance. However, if the effect changes according to participants' history, the effect was caused by learning. That is, this effect may be a conditioned response rather than an unconditioned response. Fifth, the simple reaction time task was conducted three times after the drinking session to determine when the CR would occur. However, the effect of initial rise of CR was not found. Future research should use only one session because a conditioning effect should appear in the first post-session.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Professor Kenjiro Aoyama of Doshisha University for his comments on this study.\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\n<sec>\nFunding\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nConflict of Interest\nThe author has no conflict of interest to declare.\n<sec>\nEthical Approval\nThe Institutional Review Board of Doshisha University approved this study.",

        "introduction": "Background\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) imposes significant burdens on individuals, families, and healthcare systems and the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have exacerbated OCD symptoms. Currently, there are no validated prevention programs for OCD, highlighting a critical gap in mental health services. This study aims to develop and validate the first \u00d8CD prevention program, for at-risk adults, utilizing cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and exposure response prevention (ERP) techniques.\nBackground\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the most debilitating mental health disorders, with considerable burden on patients, their families, and health services [19]. As a psychiatric disorder, it is characterized by the co-occurrence of recurring, intrusive obsessions that induce substantial distress, along with compulsions--ritualistic behaviors aimed at relieving the distress triggered by the obsessions but ultimately resulting in additional distress and impairment (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The prevalence estimates vary from 0.7-3% in adults [26],Adam et al., 2011), and 0.25-0.30% in children (Sadler et al., 2017; [17].\nOCD has both direct costs, such as medical costs [16, 18], as well as indirect costs, such as work absenteeism due to impaired functionality and lost opportunities for career advancement [9]. One UK study [19] found that the overall cost-of-illness of OCD rises to [pounds sterling]5,095,759,464, with an average annual cost-of-illness of [pounds sterling]7077 per person.\nWorryingly, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have led to an increase in the incidence of OCD. A systematic review [22] found that both people with and without diagnosed OCD before the pandemic experienced a worsening of OCD symptoms during the pandemic. One study [25] found that participants reported significantly higher OCD scores during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic, as OCD severity increased on all symptom dimensions and the most pronounced change was on the washing dimension. Another review (Cunning & Hodes, 2021) found that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a worsening of OCD symptoms in young people and that being in treatment seems to have a protective effect, thus underlining the importance of maintaining mental health services. While we have multiple evidence-based treatments for OCD, there are currently no validated protocols for the prevention of general OCD. This is a major shortcoming, seeing as an effective prevention program for at-risk individuals could constitute a preemptive strike against the high associated costs and burden of living that come with a diagnosis of OCD. Former prevention programs for depression and anxiety usually carried out for adolescents and young adults, have varying rates of efficacy, but are overall considered successful in reducing psychopathological symptoms incidence in time (Conley et al., 207; Werner et al., 2021).\nThe development and validation of an intervention protocol for the prevention of OCD among at-risk adults, as presented in the \u00d8CD prevention program, are thus paramount. By advancing OCD preventive approaches, this study offers hope for mitigating the long-term consequences of OCD and reducing the associated costs and burden on individuals and society.\nSpecific contents of the \u00d8CD prevention protocol\nThe program involves six sessions and includes established components of CBT [4] and ERP [11], namely: (1) psychoeducation and encouragement to reduce, change, or eliminate anxiety-reducing rituals (1 session), (2) cognitive restructuring by challenging dysfunctional beliefs (2 sessions), (3) behavioral changes by prolonged, imaginal and real-life exposure to distress-provoking stimuli (2 sessions), (4) addressing ways and skills to reduce relevant risk factors (i.e. fear of COVID-19) and to develop resilience factors (i.e. resilience levels, coping skills) and summary and recapitulation (1 session). The six sessions of the 2 weeks program correspond to three treatment modules (3 hours/module). An overview of the content covered in each stage is provided in Table 1.\nTable 1:\nDescription of the \u00d8CD modules and sessions\nAim of the present study\nThe main objective of the proposed study is to develop and assess the efficacy of the \u00d8CD prevention program in preventing OCD symptoms and reducing associated symptoms versus a waitlist control group. In this single-blind, superior randomized controlled trial, we will evaluate the efficacy of the \u00d8CD prevention program compared with a waitlist. If, as we hypothesize, the \u00d8CD prevention program demonstrates superiority compared to a control group, it has the potential to increase the variety of evidence-based intervention options for adults at risk of developing OCD.\nWe hypothesize that the \u00d8CD prevention program will be superior to a control group in the reduction of OCD symptoms as measured by the Obsessional Compulsive Inventory - revised form (OCI-R; [10]), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9,PHQ-9; [20]), and anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7,GAD-7; [29]). The intervention also covers the cognitive component of OCD, so we expect a reduction in obsessive beliefs (The Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire,OBQ-44; [24]) and automatic thoughts (Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire,ATQ; Steven & Phillip, 1980). We also expect a reduction in experiential avoidance levels (The Brief Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire; EAQ; Gamez et al., 2014), intolerance of uncertainty (Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale: IUS; [5]), and general distress (General Health Questionnaire-12,GHQ; [15]). As for protective factors, we expect an increase in resilience (Resilience Scale for Adults,RSA; [13]) and quality of life (WHO Quality of Life - BREF,WHOQOL-BREF; [28]).",
        "methodology": "Methods\nA single-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing the \u00d8CD prevention program to a waitlist control group will be conducted. Participants, at-risk adults (18-65 years) with subclinical OCD symptoms (OCI-R score [greater than or equal to] 12), will be recruited for the study. The \u00d8CD prevention program compresise of six online group sessions incorporating CBT and ERP techniques over three modules. The primary outcomes are OCD symptom severity (measured by the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory- revised form; OCI-R), depression symptoms (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ-9), and anxiety symptoms (measured by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item; GAD-7). Secondary outcomes include OCD-related beliefs, experiential avoidance, resilience, quality of life, uncertainty intolerance, automatic thoughts, and distress. Outcome measures will be collected at baseline, at completion of the intervention, and one year later (follow-up). At follow-up, we will also analyze the OCD diagnostic incidence, using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. We will employ a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to explore whether significant differences exist between groups across dependent variables. To compare the OCD incidence levels from the pre-test to the follow-up we will use the chi-squared test.\nDiscusion\nThe present study may contribute novel data on the efficacy of OCD prevention approaches, leading to the development of an evidence-based OCD prevention program that could alleviate individual and societal burdens associated with OCD.\nTrial registration\nThis trial was approved by the University Ethical Review Authority (937/ 28.11.2023) at Babe\u00c8-Bolyai University and is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT06262464).\nKeywords: Prevention, OCD, CBT\nAuthor(s): Roxana A. I. Cardo\u00c81 , Elisa P. Dumitru2 and Oana A. David1\nArticle summary\nMethods\nStudy design and ethical aspects\nWe will conduct a single-blind (blinded outcome assessors), randomized (1:1), controlled, parallel-group, superiority trial comparing the \u00d8CD prevention program with a control group (waitlist) for adults at risk of OCD. The study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT06262464). All quality and safety aspects will be regularly monitored by an external party: the University Ethical Review Board, and by the financing authority of the project (National Authority for Scientific Research). The study has been approved by the University Ethical Review Authority (937/28.11.2023). Potential protocol modifications will be described in detail on clinicaltrials.gov. We used the SPIRIT reporting guidelines [6].\nParticipants will be asked to provide informed consent before baseline assessment. They will receive detailed information about the study and their right to withdraw from the study without the obligation to give reasons. We do not expect major relevant risks for participants during the study, or after the study is completed. The time burden for the participants will be a reasonable amount. The data collection and storage will be conducted according to GDPR legislation, and all personal data will be securely stored on the University's encrypted servers, following the set data management guidelines.\nSample size\nG*Power was used for the sample size calculation and, following an effect size of d=0.3 with a n alpha level of [alpha] = 0.05 and power of 0.95, a sample size of 175 was suggested. Based on this power analysis and expected drop-out rates, we aim for 200 participants (100 per treatment arm). The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials flow chart of the trial is shown in Figure 1.\nFig. 1:\nCONSORT flow diagram\nRecruitment\nParticipants are recruited online, using social media platforms to promote the study. By clicking the enrolment link, participants read the study information section and the informed consent form, which can be signed digitally, by agreeing to the terms and the conditions of the study. Participants are queried about the criteria for inclusion and exclusion, following which eligible individuals are selected through randomization. The planned flow of participants can be consulted in Figure 2.\nFig. 2:\nPlanned flow of participants. Note: ATQ-Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire; BEAQ-Brief Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire; CSQ-8- Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8; GAD-7-Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; GHQ-12-General Health Questionnaire-12; IUS-Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale; OBQ-44-Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire-44; \u00d8CD - OCD prevention program; OCI-R-Obsessional Compulsive Inventory - Revised; PHQ-9-Patient Health Questionnaire-9; RSA-Resilience Scale for Adults; WHOQOL-BREF-WHO Quality of Life - BREF\nTherapists are from the clinical psychology master's program. We recruited four terminal year students following an introductory meeting on the purpose of the study and the procedures involved. The expected time expenditure for the therapists will be 9 hours per week. Before implementation, all therapists will have participated in a training supported by the study coordinator.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nParticipants are included if they are of legal age (above 18). We include participants who have an OCI-R [10] score at or above the cut-off point on the OCD subscale ([greater than or equal to] 12). Exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) clinically diagnosed OCD, (2) current psychiatric/psychotherapeutic treatment, (3) a personality disorder diagnosis, and (4) suicidal ideation.\nProcedure and randomization\nInclusion and exclusion criteria are verified based on the screening form completed by the participants. Eligible participants are randomly allocated to one of the two conditions in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization is conducted by a member of the research team, using the online tool, randomizer.org. The allocation sequence is generated through a computer-generated random sequence for the two study conditions. The following study personnel will remain blind to group allocation until the final data analyses are completed: principal investigator, data managers, and outcome assessors.\nOutcome measures\nFor participants, the baseline assessment will take place after randomization and include a set of validated questionnaires.\nPrimary outcome measures\nObsessional Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R; [10])\nOCI-R is a self-report questionnaire of 18 items, and it measures OCD symptoms across six subscales: washing, checking, neutralising, obsessing, ordering, and hoarding. OCI-R was used in the initial screening of eligible participants, where the OCD subscale (which excludes the hoarding component) was used to determine participants who are at risk of developing OCD symptoms (cut off point ([greater than or equal to] 12). For the present study, the reduction in OCI-R OCD subscale assessment is the primary outcomes.\nPatient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; [20])\nPHQ-9 is one of the most widely used measures of depression and it is based on the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV; APA, 1994). Scores vary from 0 to 27, where a greater score indicates more severe depressive symptoms.\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; [29])\nGAD-7 measures symptoms of anxiety, based on the generalized anxiety disorder criteria in DSM-IV; APA, 1994). Respondents evaluate the level of their symptoms over the last two weeks and a cut-off score greater than 10 indicates further evaluation is recommended.\nSecondary outcome measures\nObsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ-44; [24])\nOBQ-44 is a self-report scale that measures belief domains linked to OCD. The three subscales are (1) responsibility/threat estimation, (2) perfectionism/certainty, and (3) importance/control of thoughts. Answers are rated on a 7-point scale (1 = \"disagree very much\" to 7 = \"agree very much\").\nAutomatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ; Hollon & Kendall, 1980)\nThe Romanian version of ATQ [23] is a 15-item measure that evaluates self-reported negative thoughts. The questionnaire was developed to measure the most frequent negative thoughts and negative self-evaluations, typically associated with depression. Answers are rated on a 5-point scale (1 = \"not at all\" to 5 = \"all the time\") and the total score ranges from 15 to 75.\nBrief Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire (BEAQ; Gamez et al., 2014)\nThe BEAQ is a 15-item self-reports questionnaire that measures experiential avoidance. Items are rated on a 6-point Likert scale (1 = \"strongly disagree\" to 6 = \"strongly agree\"). Item 6 is a reversed item, and scores range from 15 to 90 points. Higher scores reflect higher experiential avoidance.\nIntolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS; [5])\nThe IUS is a 27-item measure that evaluates how individuals relate to uncertainty. It contains items such as \"Uncertainty makes me uneasy, anxious, or stressed\", \"A small unforeseen event can spoil everything, even with the best of planning\" and \"When I am uncertain, I can't go forward\". Answers are rated on a 5 points scale (1 = \"not at all characteristics\" to 5 = \"entirely characteristic\")\nGeneral Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12; [15])\nThe GHQ-12 consists of 12 items, each assessing the severity of a mental issue over the past few weeks. Answers are rated on a 4-point Likert scale, from 0 to 3. A total score of 36 can be generated, by rating the positive items from 0 (always) to 3 (never) and the negative ones from 3 (always) to 0 (never), so that a higher score indicate worse health.\nResilience Scale for Adults (RSA; [13])\nThe RSA is a 43-item measure with five factors: personal competence, social competence, family cohesion, social support, and personal organization. Answers are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 = \"not at all\" to 5 = \"a lot\").\nWHO Quality of Life - BREF (WHOQOL-BREF; [28])\nWHOQOL-BREF is one of the most widely used assessments of quality of life. In the current study, we will use the global item of the instrument (How would you rate your quality of life), answered on a 5-point Likert scale.\nPost-intervention assessment will take place immediately after the intervention is completed and will include the same measures, as well as the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8; [21]). The assessments will be completed online, using the Qualtrics platform. We will also perform one follow-up assessment six months later, using the same measures and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 to compare the OCD diagnostic incidence.",
        "analysis": "Statistical analyses\nData analysis\nDemographic and clinical data will be reported as means and SDs for continuous parametric data, medians, and ranges for non-parametric data, and frequencies and percentages for categorical data. Only two authors will have access to the final trial dataset. To illustrate participant flow, we will report results in a CONSORT diagram. Data analysis will be conducted using SPSS for Windows version 25. Given the anticipated dropout rate, mixed models will be employed as the most suitable statistical method. This approach is well-suited for analyzing repeated measures, accounting for the dependency between observations and handling missing data effectively. Mixed models will be adjusted for baseline values of the repeated measures. Descriptive statistics will be generated to summarize the means and proportions of baseline clinical and demographic variables across treatment conditions, allowing for the assessment of potential imbalances. Fixed effects in the model will include time, treatment, and their interaction. In cases of missing data, these variables will also be included as fixed effects. The significance of the time*treatment interaction p-values for various outcome measures will be assessed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (two-sided p < 0.05). Time will be treated categorically, with the first post-baseline measurement serving as the reference category. To address the correlation among repeated measurements, a first-order autoregressive (AR (1)) structure will be imposed on the residuals. Furthermore, the interaction effect between time and group will be explored by analyzing estimated marginal means at different time points. We anticipate a significant interaction effect between time and group, signifying differential changes in scores over time between the two treatment conditions. Specifically, we expect a more pronounced decline in scores over time in the prevention group compared to the control group. To assess the statistical significance of improvements in the treatment conditions, a least significant difference test will be conducted with estimated marginal means to compare changes between groups. Linear mixed models are expected to reveal a statistically significant decline in the prevention condition from pretest to post-test, with no significant differences between post-test and follow-up measures. To facilitate comparisons with other studies, Cohen's d statistic will be calculated to determine within-group effect sizes. In cases where the proportion of missing data exceeds 10%, maximum likelihood imputations will be performed based on demographics and pretreatment scores. Additionally, the proportions of dropouts and diagnostic incidence (from pre-test to follow-up) in the two treatment groups will be compared using the chi-square test.",
        "results": "",
        "limitations": "Strengths and limitations of this study\n* First study to develop and validate an OCD prevention program for at-risk adults.\n* The program integrates psychological prevention techniques from evidence-based treatments.\n* Moderate expected rates of participants dropout",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nAccording to the most recent clinical advances guide for OCD [12], a greater effort needs to be made at multiple levels (e.g., education, treatment services development, and screening of 'at-risk' individuals) to implement effective strategies for prevention, early diagnosis, and intervention. To the best of our knowledge, we will develop the first evidence-based cognitive-behavioral prevention program for OCD for at-risk individuals. The study will provide novel data about the efficacy of OCD preventive strategies. Implementing the prevention program in normal healthcare would significantly enhance the availability of effective prevention programs to persons at risk of developing OCD. The potential benefits of such a prevention program extend beyond individual participants to encompass broader societal and research impacts. By intervening early to prevent the onset of OCD symptoms, the program could alleviate strain on mental health services, reduce healthcare costs, and improve overall well-being. Moreover, the research generated from implementing and evaluating this innovative prevention approach could inform future interventions and contribute to advancing our understanding of OCD prevention.\nTrial status\nInclusion started in March 2024 and is expected to end in October 2024. At the time of submission, 121 participants had been randomized. Data analysis and reporting of results will begin when all data from the primary endpoint has been collected.\nAbbreviations: OCD: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; CBT: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; ERP: Exposure and Response Prevention\nAcknowledgements: None\nCorrespondence:\nAuthor details: 1 https://ror.org/02rmd1t30, grid.7399.4, 0000 0004 1937 1397, The International Institute for the Advanced Studies of Psychotherapy and Applied Mental Health, Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Babe\u00c5-Bolyai University, , Cluj-Napoca, Romania. 2 https://ror.org/02rmd1t30, grid.7399.4, 0000 0004 1937 1397, The International Institute for the Advanced Studies of Psychotherapy and Applied Mental Health, Doctoral School \"Evidence-based assessment and psychological interventions\", Babe\u00c8-Bolyai University, , No. 37, Republicii Street, 400015, Cluj-Napoca, Cluj, Romania.",

        "introduction": "Background\nWorking alliance is a prominent non-specific factor for treatment outcomes in face-to-face and internet-based interventions. The association between working alliance and therapy outcome appears to be time- and disorder-specific, but less is known about the change of working alliance during the intervention and the impact of working alliance in grief-specific interventions. The present study examines the association between the change of working alliance and treatment outcomes in an internet-based intervention for parents who experienced pregnancy loss.\nBackground\nThe experience of perinatal loss can be traumatic, often resulting in intensive grief and post-traumatic stress symptoms [1]. Despite a growing awareness of the emotional and psychiatric impact of perinatal loss, few affected parents receive therapeutic intervention, and manualized interventions tailored for this group have rarely been evaluated [1-3].\nInternet-based interventions offer a promising approach, enhancing healthcare services by offering an additional, supplemental, and cost-effective path to delivering those services. Interventions conducted via the internet provide more anonymity, privacy, and flexibility compared to face-to-face interventions. This makes them particularly appealing for clients or patients who fear stigmatization or are difficult to reach [4-6].\nIn order to comprehend and improve online treatment outcomes, it is crucial to identify common and specific factors that influence those outcomes [7]. The therapeutic relationship is considered an important factor impacting the success of therapy in face-to-face studies [8-10]. It is represented in part by the construct of therapeutic alliance [11, 12], which is often conceptualized as working alliance [13-16]. The term working alliance (WA) encompasses the quality and strength of the relationship between client and therapist, incorporating three interlocking components: task , goal , and bond [14-16]. The bond dimension describes the emotional aspects of the relationship between therapist and patient (i.e. level of trust, respect, and caring). The task dimension refers to the agreement on tasks in the process, whereas the goal dimension refers to an accord on implicit or explicit aims of the treatment [14, 15, 17].\nThe association between WA and treatment outcome in internet-based interventions has undergone extensive examination [13, 18] and shows a small but robust effect size, quantitatively similar (r = .202-0.275) [19-21, 13] to face-to-face interventions (r = .278) [9, 13, 22]. Meta-analytical data indicates minor variations in the alliance-outcome association. These variations might occur due to factors related to the intervention, characteristics of the sample involved, or the methods employed [19, 21].\nKaiser et al. [19] identified point of data collection (early-, mid-, post-treatment) of WA as the only significant moderator affecting the association between WA and treatment outcome in internet-based interventions. In general, WA showed greater robustness and was correlated more often with treatment outcomes when measured at the end of the internet-based treatment [19]. This observation suggests that WA may develop progressively throughout treatment and grows linearly. However, this assumption was not directly tested in internet-based studies.\nTo the best of our knowledge, all studies included in the aforementioned meta-analytical studies [19, 21] only examined the correlation of WA with outcome based on one point of data collection, e.g., mid-treatment(e.g., [26, 27]) or post-treatment (e.g., [28, 29]), or correlated an average WA score (composite score) with outcome measures [29, 30]. Findings were mixed, revealing either an association [29, 30] or no association between WA and improvement in treatment outcomes [31].\nWe found no study calculating the change in WA and its correlation with treatment outcome. One possible explanation might be that WA scores did not change during the intervention (e.g., 33). In other studies, the observed variations in WA were not treated as a separate predictor for treatment outcome (e.g., 31). Assessing the change in WA throughout treatment enhances our understanding of the association between WA and treatment outcomes in internet-based interventions. In contrast to other studies, the present study focuses on the change in WA during an internet-based intervention.\nThe treated diagnoses and corresponding symptoms may influence to what extent WA is associated with treatment outcomes in internet-based interventions similar to face-to-face interventions [13, 33]. Literature remains scarce about the evaluation of WA in grief-specific internet-based interventions, despite data from face-to-face therapies highlighting the important role of WA in the treatment of prolonged grief [34, 35]. To the best of our knowledge, just one further study evaluated the association of WA and treatment outcome in an internet-based treatment program using internet-delivered writing assignments [36]. This study used therapist-rated instead of patient-rated WA. Although patient and therapist ratings seem to be associated similarly with treatment outcomes [13], the study did not find a significant association between WA and grief [36]. We aim to investigate the association of patient-rated WA and grief-specific outcomes to enhance existing findings.\nGrief symptoms exhibit both similarities and differences with related syndromes, like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety [35, 37]. Changes in WA might also correlate with these syndromes. Internet-based grief interventions were found effective in reducing grief and PTSD symptoms, with moderate to large effect sizes, yet appeared less effective in reducing depression symptoms, with small effect sizes [38, 39]. Network analysis revealed higher levels of symptom overlap between prolonged grief and PTSD compared to depression [40]. These findings indicate that WA is less associated with depression and anxiety than PTSD.\nIn our study, we focus on grief symptoms that occurred after pregnancy loss. Grief reactions after prenatal loss may differ slightly from other forms of bereavement: Cognitive processing has been found to primarily involve guilt-related content [41-43], and a reduced occurrence of mourning rituals has been found [44]. However, the intensity of grief after perinatal loss might be comparable to grief following other forms of loss [1].\nIn addition to point of data collection and the treated symptoms involved, research also shows that task, goal, and bond related-aspects of WA may demonstrate different associations to treatment outcome. Bond related aspects might be less important than goal- and task-oriented aspects, due to remote contact and reduced interaction in internet-based interventions [18, 21]. Studies indicated that task-related aspects of WA correlated significantly higher with treatment outcomes than bond-related aspects [21]. Other studies report high bond-related ratings early in the program [18]. Our study aims to clarify the question of how various aspects of the WA are associated with treatment outcomes [45].\nAims and hypothesis\nThis study seeks to analyze the association of changes in WA with symptom outcomes of an internet-based intervention for grief reactions after prenatal loss. Our first hypothesis predicts a significant increase in WA during the treatment [1]. Additionally we hypothesized: An increase in WA during the treatment correlates with a reduction in grief symptoms as the primary outcome [2], and the increase in WA is predictive of grief reduction [3]. Task- and goal-related aspects of WA are more important for the reduction in grief symptoms than bond-related aspects [4]. We expected that an increase in WA is also correlated with secondary outcomes like a reduction in traumatic reactions [5] and an improvement of global mental health [6], but less with a reduction in depressive [7] or anxious reactions [8, 38, 39].",
        "methodology": "Methods\n228 participants received a grief intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy with asynchronous text-based therapist feedback. Prolonged grief and related symptoms of traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and general psychopathology were assessed with validated instruments before and after the intervention. The change of working alliance was assessed using the short version of the Working Alliance Inventory at mid-treatment (session 4) and the end of the treatment (session 10).\nMethods\nThe present study focuses on the impact of changes in WA in an internet-based cognitive behavioral intervention on grief symptoms after pregnancy loss. It is a secondary analysis of data presented in Kersting et al. [46]. Primary outcome analyses showed that an internet-based cognitive behavioral intervention significantly reduced symptoms of prolonged grief, traumatic stress, and overall psychopathology [46, 47].\nParticipants\nThe internet-based cognitive behavioral intervention was offered to parents who had lost a child during pregnancy. Information about the study was distributed with the help of medical practitioners and midwives, who informed potential participants. Study information was also published through radio, TV, internet, and newspaper announcements.\nInclusion criteria for participating were [1] loss of a child during pregnancy through miscarriage, termination of pregnancy due to medical indication, or stillbirth at any time in the past [2], living in a European German-speaking country [3], being able to read and write the German language fluently [4], having access to the internet, and [5] signing informed consent. Exclusion criteria were [1] age < 18 years [2], having a current pregnancy [3], being in psychotherapy, and [4] suffering from serious mental health problems, like severely depressed mood, suicidal tendencies, dissociative tendencies, psychotic symptoms, or substance abuse or dependence. These criteria were assessed with validated instruments via an online screening procedure. Participants who did not meet the criteria were offered guidance towards suitable treatment options and assistance in finding treatment if requested. For a more detailed description of the recruitment process, see Kersting et al. [46, p. 373].\nAfter the recruitment process, participants were randomly assigned to a treatment group (TG; N = 115) or a waiting control group (WCG; N = 113). Participants in the waiting group received the treatment five weeks later.\nTreatment\nThe intervention is based on the Interapy program [48], which has been evaluated several times [49, 50]. It is an asynchronous text-based and therapist-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy program for PTSD, consisting of 10 writing assignments based on the written disclosure procedure [51]. The internet-based intervention was later adapted for prolonged grief [52] and could achieve a reduction of prolonged grief within a medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.52).\nThe intervention in this study consisted of 10 writing tasks, divided into three sections: [1] self-confrontation (4 writing assignments) [2], cognitive reappraisal (4 writing assignments), and [3] social sharing (2 writing assignments). The first Sect [1]. comprised repeated detailed (cognitive, emotional, and sensory) self-confrontation with the loss. In the second section of cognitive reappraisal [2], participants repeatedly wrote a letter to a hypothetical friend who experienced a similar loss. They were encouraged to change their perspective and reflect on assumptions, dysfunctional automatic thinking or behavior, and feelings of guilt. In the last Sect [3]., participants wrote a letter to a significant other or themselves, outlined the most difficult memory of the pregnancy loss, reflected upon the therapeutic process, and explained their coping with the loss in the future. Communication between therapists and patients was asynchronous and exclusively text-based, consisting of personal feedback by e-mail after every second writing task from sessions 1 to 8 and every writing task after the 9th and 10th task. Participants were instructed to spend approximately 45 min per writing task. Participants were encouraged to write or call the therapist only in case of crisis and distress. Contacts beyond the writing assignments occurred infrequently. The exact number of contacts and the therapist's characteristics were not coded. The majority of therapists participated in a training program to become licensed psychotherapists and were supervised regularly by the licensed psychotherapists working in this project. On average they treated 20.7 participants (SD = 13.2; see Table A).\nMeasures\nThe outcome measures were prolonged grief, traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and global mental health. Symptoms were assessed using self-report questionnaires at baseline, post-treatment, and follow-ups 3 and 12 months after the end of treatment. As participants completed the short form of the Working Alliance Inventory [53, 54] at mid-treatment after two weeks (after session 4) and at post-treatment (after session 10), analysis of the outcome scores in the present study includes only pre-treatment and post-treatment. A detailed description and the psychometric properties of the questionnaires are mentioned below.\nWorking alliance\nThe working alliance was measured with the short form of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-S) [53]. There was no validated German version of this questionnaire. The German translation was developed by Knaevelsrud and Maercker [28, 55]. 12 items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = \"never\" to 7 = \"always\"). Higher scores indicate a better quality of the WA. A total score (ranging from 12 to 84) comprises three subscales (goal, task, and bond). The three subscales correlate highly with each other. The factor structure of the short form has not been validated [60]. Recent work used the revised form of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SR) [60]. At the time of assessment of this study, the translated and validated form of the WAI-SR was not yet available. Nevertheless, the WAI-S is a reliable measure of the therapeutic alliance [61]. The internal consistency of the total scale of the WAI-S in the present study was good, ranging from Cronbach's [alpha] = 0.80 at mid-treatment to Cronbach's [alpha] = 0.85 at post-treatment.\nProlonged grief\nProlonged grief was measured using the German version of the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) [56]. The ICG measures emotions, cognitions, and behaviors concerning grief. It consists of 15 items rated on a five-point measurement scale (1 = \"almost never\" to 5 = \"always\"). The ICG has been shown to have good to excellent psychometric properties with a Cronbach's [alpha] of 0.94 [56]. In the present study, Cronbach's [alpha] was 0.89 at pre-test and 0.91 at post-test.\nTraumatic stress\nTraumatic stress was assessed by the German version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) [57]. Based on 22 items, a total score and the three subscales intrusion , avoidance , and hyperarousal can be calculated. The frequency of each symptom over the last seven days is assessed on a four-point Likert scale (0 = \"not at all\", 1 = \"sometimes\", 3 = \"rarely\", 5 = \"often\"). The IES-R has been shown good to excellent psychometric properties with Cronbach's [alpha] = 0.90 [57]. In the present study, Cronbach's [alpha] of the total IES-R score ranged from 0.84 at pre-test to 0.90 at post-test.\nGeneral psychopathology, depression, and anxiety\nThe German version of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) [58] was used to measure global mental health, depression, and anxiety symptoms. The BSI consists of 53 items, assessing the experience of physical and psychological symptoms on a five-point Likert scale (0 = \"not at all\" to 4 = \"very often\"). Nine primary symptoms indices can be calculated, including depression and anxiety addressed in this study. Their sum provides a Global Severity Index (GSI) of overall mental health. In the present study, Cronbach's [alpha] of the GSI score ranged from 0.94 at pre-test to 0.96 at post-test. Cronbach's [alpha] for the subscale depression was 0.83 at pre-test and post-test. Cronbach's [alpha] for the subscale anxiety was 0.77 pre- and respectively 0.82 at post-test.\nSociodemographic and obstetric data\nThe socio-demographic data collected included age, gender, level of education based on the highest school qualification (low, medium, high), years of education, and employment status. In addition, the strength of religiosity and faith was assessed (\"How strong would you describe your religiosity or faith?\"). The item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = \"not at all\" to 5 = \"very strong\"). The time since the prenatal loss, the pregnancy week during which the loss occurred, and the number of previous miscarriages were recorded as obstetric data and included in the sample description.",
        "analysis": "Statistical analysis\nThe original data set contained data from a treatment group and a waiting control group (see 47). Both groups received the intervention. The treatment group started the intervention right after the baseline survey. For ethical reasons, the waiting control group received the intervention five weeks later. The waiting group completed a baseline survey before the waiting period and a pre-treatment survey after the waiting period. The data before and after treatment from both groups was merged to increase the statistical power of subsequent tests. Post hoc analysis was conducted using t-tests and chi-square tests to examine significant differences between the two groups.\nDropouts and missing values were identified afterwards. A distinction was made between three types of dropouts: Nonstarters who did not start the intervention [59], dropouts who did not complete the intervention or the post-measurement, and dropouts who did not establish a complete data set due to missing values on a whole scale.\nMissing values at item level were then analyzed and classified in the final analysis sample. The MCAR Little test was chosen to evaluate missing values of all scales [60]. After evaluating missing values, they were computed by the participant's mean of the scales or subscales [61].\nMeans and standard deviation of the WAI-S total score, its subscales, and the primary outcome were calculated for all measurement points (pre- and post-treatment, respectively mid- and post-treatment in the case of WA). Possible differences in the mean values between the treatment group and waiting control group were checked using two-tailed t-test and chi-square test. Based on non-existent mean differences, the aforementioned merging procedure was acceptable.\nDependent two-tailed t-tests were conducted to account for within-group differences. Effect sizes for repeated measurement d Repeated Measures (d RM ) were calculated [62]. Absolute change scores were calculated to account for changes in the WA throughout therapy. They were reliable [63, 64] and superior to other relative change scores [65]. Statistical analysis included the correlation of change in WA with the outcome change scores. As the predictor changes in WA and changes in the BSI were not normally distributed, the bivariate Spearman correlation coefficient, a more conservative nonparametric measure, was used. WAI-S absolute change scores (post- minus mid-treatment) were correlated with the absolute change scores in symptomatology of grief (ICG), posttraumatic stress (IES-R), depression (BSI), anxiety (BSI) as well as global mental health (BSI) (each post- minus pre-treatment scores). Effect sizes for repeated measurements were calculated for the differences in pre- and post-scores of all variables [62].\nAdditionally, hierarchical regression analyses were calculated for the outcome measures to estimate the influence of change in WA on treatment outcome. Only variables significantly correlating with changes in WA were included in the regression analysis. Based on outlier analyses, data points that were three standard deviations below or above the mean of each variable were eliminated [66]. We tested for autocorrelation, normal distribution of residues, and multicollinearity. Requirements for regression analysis were fulfilled.\nThe absolute change scores of the primary (ICG) and secondary outcomes (BSI, IES-R) were used as dependent variables, and the absolute change scores of the WA (WAI-S) were used as independent variables. The pre-scores of the corresponding outcome variables were used as independent variables to control for initial symptom levels. A single hierarchical regression model was calculated for each outcome variable and each subscale of the WAI-S. Based on theoretical reasons, multicollinearity was assumed among the subscales, which was then also present in the data set. Therefore, the subscales were analyzed in separate regression models.\nAll analyses were conducted using SPSS 27. The significance level was set at [alpha] = 0.05 for all statistical analysis. Taking into account the multiple testing in t-tests, correlation, and regression analysis, the Benjamini and Hochberg correction was used to adjust for the false discovery rate [67].",
        "results": "Results\nData for N = 146 persons was analyzed. Working alliance in total and all subscales increased significantly from sessions 4 to 10. This change in working alliance correlated significantly with a reduction in prolonged grief. Changes in subscales of working alliance also correlated with symptoms of depression and general psychopathology. Regression analysis showed that a change in working alliance predicted a reduction in prolonged grief but did not predict improvements in other grief-related symptoms.\nResults\nAttrition\nAfter the screening (N = 381), 228 participants met the inclusion criteria, gave informed consent, and were randomized into a treatment and waiting control group (see flowchart Fig. 1). Of the 228 participants who completed the baseline survey, 17 participants in the waiting control group left the program without participating in the intervention (nonstarters) [59]. 32 participants out of both groups dropped out of the intervention or did not complete the post-survey (referred to as dropouts). 32 participants did not answer at least one questionnaire before or after treatment. One more participant was assigned to this group due to missing data at scale level (15 items missing in a row).\nFig. 1:\nParticipants' progression flowchart\nParticipants who dropped out before the intervention, respectively before the post-survey, were younger (t (43.82) = 2.76, p = .008) and less religious (t (53.44) = 2.10, p = .041) than completers. In terms of obstetric data, dropouts lost their child significantly earlier in pregnancy (t (163.37) = 2.14, p = .034). No significant differences between these dropouts and completers were found in any other baseline measures or in the mid-treatment score of working alliance (see appendix, Table B). Dropout due to missing values on an entire questionnaire or its subscales did not differ significantly from the mean values of the completers in any of the variables examined (see appendix, Table C).\nMissing values at item-level\nMissing values from the analyzed sample of N = 146 were further evaluated. The number of missing values per scale is described in the appendix (see Table D). First, Little's MCAR test was used to obtain an initial indication of the distribution of missing values in relation to the total scales. The missing completely at random (MCAR) assumption was rejected, as the test was significant for both the BSI total scale and the WAI-S post scale. However, the missing values of the BSI scale were not subject to any notable pattern. At item level, three items had two missing values each. The contents of the items did not provide sufficient information to make conclusions regarding missing values based on the missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR) assumption. Missing values were therefore imputed with the person mean [61].\nIn the distribution of missing values in terms of the WAI-S, it is apparent that there were more missing values after the 4th writing task at mid-treatment (first point of data collection). It is possible that participants skipped items because they might have felt unable to assess the alliance at this early stage of the process. However, no noticeable pattern of missing values could be identified at the subscale level. An imputation of the missing values by the participant's mean values was also seen to be tolerable [61].\nParticipants\nParticipants' ages ranged from 25 to 45, with a mean age of M = 34.53 (SD = 4.91). 91.8% (n = 134) were female, 8.2% (n = 12) were male. No differences between the treatment group (TG, n = 83) and the waiting control group (WCG, n = 63) were found for demographic as well as obstetric data, as can be seen in the outcome paper of Kersting, et al. [46]. In addition, the mean values of the two groups did not differ regarding any outcome measure before and after the intervention (see appendix, Table E). The matching of data of both groups was considered to be acceptable.\nChanges in symptoms and working alliance\nMean scores of all t-tests of the WAI-S scores, its subscales, and the effect sizes for repeated measurements d RM [62] are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1:\nWAI-S mean scores, results of the t-tests and effect sizes\nThe mean scores of all t-tests of the primary and secondary outcome scores can be found in Table 2. All t-tests indicated that pre- and post-scores differed significantly (p < .001), i.e., WAI-S scores increased and all outcome scores decreased. The average rating of WAI-S was close to the maximum of 7. Therefore, a ceiling effect is to be assumed, especially at post-treatment.\nTable 2:\nOutcome mean scores, results of the t-tests and effect sizes\nCorrelations of outcome and changes in the working alliance\nSpearman correlations between the change in the WA and the change in the outcomes are presented in Table 3.\nTable 3:\nSpearman correlations between the change in working alliance and the change in the outcomes\nThe WAI-S change score and all change scores of the subscales correlated significantly with the ICG change score (for Spearman's [rho] of the subscales, see Table 3). Concerning the IES-R, there was no significant correlation between the WAI-S change score and the IES-R change scores. Concerning the BSI, significant correlations were found for the total WAI-S change score, changes in the subscale of goal, and changes in the subscale of bond with the BSI subscale depression and the BSI total scale of global mental health . Furthermore, the change score of the goal subscale of WAI-S correlated significantly with the change score of the BSI anxiety subscale (Spearman's [rho] = 0.22, p = .021). All correlations indicate as the WA increases, there is a corresponding reduction in symptoms.\nPrediction of treatment outcome\nHierarchical regression analyses were used to test the influence of changes in WA on the symptom level changes in case the change in WA correlated significantly with the outcome variables. The pre-treatment score was entered in a first step to control for the initial symptom level. In the second step, the WAI-S change score was entered. Results are shown in Table 4 and the appendix (see Table F).\nAfter controlling for the initial ICG total score (adjusted R 2 = 0.36, F [1,144] = 82.66, p < .001), the change in the WAI-S total score significantly predicted treatment outcome (adjusted R 2 = 0.39, F[2,143] = 47.73, p < .001). Similarly, the change scores of the subscales bond (adjusted R 2 = 0.38, F [2,143] = 45.93, p < .001) predicted treatment outcome as well. Results of the subscales can be found in Table 4.\nTable 4:\nPrediction model of changes of outcome variables by changes in working alliance\nOther models predicting outcome variables were not significant. The WAI-S change score of the subscales goal and task did not predict the change in the ICG. The WAI-S change scores did not predict changes in any scale of the BSI, which showed significant Spearman correlations before.",
        "limitations": "Conclusion\nThe results examine the change of working alliance during an internet-based intervention and the association with treatment outcome. A small impact of change in working alliance on treatment outcome of prolonged grief was confirmed, but not on related symptoms. Further research is needed to assess moderators of the alliance-outcome association to improve internet-based interventions.\nTrial registration\nNot applicable.\nKeywords: Working alliance, Therapeutic relationship, Internet-based therapy, Cognitive behavioral therapy, Pregnancy loss, Perinatal loss, Grief, Prolonged grief, Traumatic stress\nAuthor(s): Martin Kramuschke1 , Jana Reinhardt1 , Ruth D\u00f6lemeyer1 , Julia Kaiser1 and Anette Kersting1\nLimitations .\nOur results should be interpreted considering some limitations. First, we observed ceiling effects for WA. The ceiling effects may have reduced variance and led to type 2 errors in regression analysis. Further studies could use visual analog scales to avoid ceiling effects in measuring WA [72].\nRegarding the measurement of the WA, we would like to make two critical remarks. First, the German translation of the questionnaire used was not validated. The structural validity of the measurement instrument could be questioned.\nSecond, the WA in our paper directly refers to the therapist of the internet-based intervention. In a few studies, instruction was changed slightly, and the goal- and task-specific items were related to the online program instead of the therapist (e.g., [71, 76]). This could have strengthened or weakened the alliance-outcome association contingent upon program and therapist contact. Further studies should use the validated and adjusted Working Alliance Inventory for guided Internet interventions (WAI-I) by G\u00f3mez Penedo et al. [74] to appropriately measure task- and goal-specific aspects of the interventions.\nThird, we measured the WA only two times at mid- and post-treatment. Future Studies should consider measuring WA at multiple points to gain a deeper insight into the changes in WA throughout the course of the intervention. The frequent measuring of WA (see [25, 73-75]) would enable observing WA's course during the program [76] and would assure linking WA to intervention techniques.\nThe sample predominantly consisted of female participants, which minimizes the generalizability of our results. Furthermore, the analysis has concentrated on grief symptoms, which were assessed through the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG). However, the ICG does not wholly cover current criteria for prolonged grief according to DSM-5 or ICD-11 [77]. Future studies may use the Traumatic Grief Inventory Self-Report Version (TGI-SR) [78].\nConclusions\nThe present study contributes to the existing research in the field of alliance-outcome association and expands empirical evidence for the role of changes in WA in grief-addressing internet-based interventions. Our findings suggest that WA increases in total and all subscales upon mid-treatment and that this increase is associated with grief reduction. Open questions remain concerning the detailed course of WA, the possible influence of intervention techniques on WA, and the detailed moderators of alliance-outcome association. Further clarification of these questions might be necessary for future interventions to deepen the understanding of differential results regarding the relationship and impact of WA on treatment outcomes.\nAbbreviations: BSI: Brief Symptom Inventory; GSI: Global Severity Index; ICG: Inventory of Complicated Grief; IES-R: Impact of Event Scale-Revised; MCAR: Missing completely at random; PTSD: posttraumatic stress disorder; TG: treatment group; WA: working alliance; WAI-S: Working Alliance Inventory-short form; WCG: waiting control group\nAcknowledgements: The authors thank Birgit Wagner, Katja Baust, Kerstin Kroker, Franziska Kamphake, Jana Steinig, and Sarah Schlicht for their support and work on the project.

        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe present study analyzes the association of changes in WA in an internet-based cognitive-behavioral intervention with grief symptoms after pregnancy loss. The applied cognitive behavioral therapy program significantly reduced symptoms of prolonged grief, traumatic stress, and overall psychopathology [46, 47]. We studied the change of WA during the program and the effect of WA change on reducing grief symptoms in a sample of parents who lost a child during pregnancy.\nThe present study provides evidence that WA (total scale and all subscales) increased significantly during a short intervention from sessions 4 to 10. The results are in line with two other internet-based interventions that also reported an increase in WA [30, 68]. Other studies found no significant change from mid- to post-treatment [32, 69] or did not reported any change [28, 29]. When looking at similar studies in terms of methods (point of data collection and statistics) and content (type of treatment) (see 49), differences might be explained by cultural aspects. Knaevelsrud and Maercker [30] studied PTSD in a German sample. In contrast, Wagner et al. [32] studied PTSD in an Arabic sample. Our results might be more in line with the findings of Knaevelsrud and Maercker, who studied a German sample [30]. Nevertheless, this conclusion cannot be drawn based on our sample. Future studies should engage in conducting cultural comparative studies encompassing diverse cultural samples to clarify the question of intercultural differences concerning the impact of working alliance on intervention outcomes.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that correlates changes in WA - as opposed to one WA score at a specific time (e.g., mid- or post-treatment) - with treatment outcome. Concerning our second hypothesis, correlational results indicate that an increase in WA was associated with reduced grief symptoms. Regression analysis showed that increased WA predicted a decrease in grief symptoms when controlling for pretreatment grief symptom severity (hypothesis 3). The increase in the total WA accounted for 3.6% of the variance in the grief-specific symptom change. Probst et al. [21] reported in their meta-analysis over 23 studies that alliance-outcome correlations accounted for 6% o treatment outcomes variability. The explained variance in our study may be smaller because of a non-clinical sample. Furthermore, Probst et al. [21] included studies with remote face-to-face contact. This might have raised the influence of the WA on treatment outcomes.\nRegarding our hypothesis 4, task- and goal-specific aspects of WA should have correlated more with grief reduction than bond-specific aspects [18, 34]. This hypothesis could not be confirmed. Correlational analysis revealed that goal-, task-, and bond-specific aspects of WA were associated with grief reduction, but only the bond-specific aspect predicted grief reduction in regression analysis. Other studies found the task- and the goal-subscale more often correlated with treatment outcome than the bond-subscale [34, 68, 70]. First of all, the non-significance result regarding the goal- and task-subscale should be interpreted cautiously because the WAI-S subscales correlate highly [71]. The non-significance of both subscales might be driven by reduced statistical power. Moreover, the variance in those subscales might have been slightly lower than in the other subscales due to clear instructions before the program's start. Due to the more standardized instructions in the internet-based therapy, there may have been less uncertainty regarding the goals. Another explanation could lie in the particular characteristics of grief-focused interventions: Given the sensitive nature of grief [35] and prenatal loss in particular, the emotional bond between therapist and participant may play a particularly crucial role. Hence, treating grief after pregnancy loss might benefit more from focusing on bond-related aspects. A meta-analysis stating that bond related aspects might be slightly less important than task-oriented aspects [21] only focused on interventions other than grief-related. There might be still limited understanding regarding the specific significance of the working alliance in interventions addressing grief related to perinatal loss, as well as its influence on bereavement interventions overall [36]. Future studies should therefore focus on examining the influence of the subscales on outcomes in disorder-specific interventions.\nRegarding our hypothesis 5, WA was not associated with posttraumatic stress and its subscales, although internet-based grief interventions were found to reduce posttraumatic stress symptoms even stronger than grief symptoms [39, 40]. Similar results applied to the other symptom outcomes. According to hypothesis 6, an increase in WA correlated with a reduction in global symptom severity. Only the WA change in the task subscale was not associated with decreasing global symptom severity. The change of WA was not of predictive value for global mental health change. Similar findings were found regarding hypotheses 7 and 8. The increase in WA was correlated with a reduction in depression for the total scale as well as the subscales goal and bond. A reduction in anxiety symptoms was correlated with changes only in the goal subscale. These results should be interpreted with caution because the regression analysis did not confirm any predictive value of all WA scales. Since these results are inconclusive, future research should further differentiate the symptom-specific effects of WA in internet-based therapies for grief.\nTo summarize, we found an increase in the WA and all its subscales during the program. The increase in WA predicts, to some extent, a reduction of prolonged grief symptoms. Our results are in line with the effect sizes of meta-analytical data for the influence of WA on treatment outcomes [19].",

Improving knowledge on barriers, facilitators and needs of primary care providers (PCPs) to BSH deprescribing could help reduce BSH use and thus negative effects.\nBackground\nBenzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotic drugs (BSHs) are frequently prescribed for sleep problems, although guidelines recommend cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as first-line therapy and to avoid BSHs in older people [1, 2]. BSH use has been reported to be as high as 15-30% in older adults with 87% taking BSHs for sleep problems [3-5]. Nevertheless, their effects on sleep are only modest and short-lasting [6, 7]. Furthermore, BSHs cause relevant side effects, including falls, fractures and cognitive impairment as well as dependence [8, 9]. This leads to high healthcare and social costs [10]. Moreover, this also highlights a need for deprescribing.\nDeprescribing is defined as \"the process of withdrawal of an inappropriate medication, supervised by a health care professional with the goal of managing polypharmacy and improving outcomes\" [11]. Barriers and facilitators to BSH deprescribing from the perspective of patients, physicians and nurses have been studied previously and the application of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) allowed identification of different behavioral determinants to BSH deprescribing in the ambulatory setting [12-14]. Moreover, different interventions to deprescribe BSHs have been investigated and shown variable success [15]. This variability might be due to a lack of consideration of barriers and facilitators, among other at a local level. While some barriers and facilitators are universal, others might indeed be more specific to the context.\nTo our knowledge, barriers and facilitators to deprescribe BSHs in older adults have not been studied in Switzerland. Furthermore, primary care providers (PCPs) needs and opinions on what could support them and their patients have not been evaluated.\nThe aim of our study was thus to identify local barriers and facilitators to deprescribe BSHs and further assess PCPs perspectives on what could support them and their patients in deprescribing BSHs.",
        "methodology": "Methods\nWe conducted a mixed methods study (February-May 2023) including a survey, semi-structured interviews and focus groups with PCPs in Switzerland. We assessed barriers, facilitators and needs of PCPs to BSH deprescribing. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, qualitative data deductively and inductively using the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF). Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated using meta-interferences.\nMethods\nStudy design and setting\nWe conducted a mixed methods parallel study including a survey, semi-structured interviews and focus groups (FGs) with PCPs in Switzerland. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions, while interviews and FGs collected qualitative data. A mix of interviews and FGs was chosen for practical organizational reason (easier to plan individual interviews than FGs with PCPs). Focus groups are used in qualitative research and allow to explore thoughts and concepts of participants during a group discussion led by a researcher. The FGs and interviews took place in March 2023, and the survey was open from February to May 2023.\nThe study protocol was waived from approval by the local ethical committee (\"Kantonale Ethikkommission Bern\"), because it did not fall under the Swiss Human Research Law (request number 2022-01423). Participation was voluntary, and participants provided consent for interview/FG recording. They were informed that their name would appear nowhere.\nThis article follows the STROBE checklist for reporting [16].\nStudy population and sample size\nFor the survey, PCPs working in an ambulatory practice in any part of Switzerland and caring for an adult population (i.e., not pediatrician) were eligible. For the interviews and FGs, recruitment was limited to the French- and German-speaking parts of the country, which represent 85% of the population of Switzerland. PCPs were contacted by e-mail, as well as through advertisements in medical journals and newsletters usually read by PCPs in Switzerland.\nUsing Survey System calculator (www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm), we calculated that 120 PCPs would provide a margin of error of 9% with a 95% confidence interval. For the qualitative part, we estimated that we would achieve data saturation with 10 interviews/FGs. We planned about half of them with native French speakers, and the other half with native German speakers. Except for language, other elements for variation of sample (e.g., gender, level of experience) were not specially considered.\nData collection and study procedures\nThe survey was conducted online using surveymonkey.com (SurveyMonkey Inc., San Mateo, California, USA) and was available in German and in French. It included open- and close-ended questions on demographic variables and professional experience, as well as on barriers, facilitators and needs to deprescribe BSHs in older adults taking BSHs for sleep problems (Additional File 2). At the end of the survey, PCPs had the possibility to disclose their contact information to be rewarded an amount of CHF20 (about $20) for participation. They were informed that their data would be treated confidentially. However, they could also leave their answers anonymous. This process was introduced to reduce the risk of selecting only PCPs who agreed to disclose their contact information.\nThe interviews and FGs were conducted virtually and based on a guide available in Additional File 3. The guide was developed by the authors based on the research goals. It included an explanation of the general conditions of interviews/FG conduction and an introduction of the topic, followed by six questions concerning perceived barriers, facilitators and needs to deprescribe BSHs in older adults taking them for sleep problems. Interviews and FGs were led by two researchers (DA and CEA). The choice of conducting FGs or interviews was led by PCP availability in term of dates and time. Additional researchers (OH, PL) assisted and took field notes. A duration of 20 min for the interviews and 45 min for the FGs was planned. PCPs were compensated CHF30 (about $30) for participation. Interviews and FGs were recorded and transcribed verbatim.\nMeasures\nThe survey was divided in four parts: 1) nine questions on demographic parameters including age, gender, practice setting, work status (independent vs. employed), professional experience and daily work routine (having ever discontinued BSHs, routinely considering BSH discontinuation, knowing where to refer patients for treatment of sleep problems and for CBT-I); 2) three questions on the need for material for patients; 3) three questions about the needs of a PCP; and 4) three open questions for adding additional information.",
        "analysis": "Data analysis\nQuantitative analysis: Survey quantitative data and population characteristics (age, gender, practice setting, work status (independent vs. employed), professional experience and daily work routine (having ever discontinued BSHs, routinely considering BSH discontinuation, knowing where to refer patients for treatment of sleep problems and for CBT-I)) were analyzed using descriptive statistics and presented as numbers with percentages.\nQualitative analysis: Qualitative data were analyzed using a mixed deductive and inductive approach based on the TDF version 1, which is frequently used for deprescribing/de-implementation research [13, 14, 17-19], to identify barriers and facilitators to BSH deprescribing. The TDF version 1 includes the following domains: knowledge; skills; social/professional role and identity; beliefs about capabilities; beliefs about consequences; motivation and goals; memory, attention and decision processes; environmental context and resources; social influences; emotion; behavioral regulation; nature of behaviors. Coding was conducted by PL and NH and iteratively discussed with the senior author, who made final adaptations.\nIntegration of quantitative and qualitative data: Quantitative and qualitative results were integrated using joint displays to draw meta-inferences. Meta-inferences are conclusions that we can draw of the integration of both qualitative and quantitative data. We used them to describe the mixed data results as convergent, divergent, or expanding.\nWhen quotes were reported in the article, they were translated to English by the first author, while the last author checked the translation. Both authors are fluent in German, French and English.\nQuantitative data were analyzed with Stata version Stata/MP 16.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) and qualitative data using MAXQDA 2022 software (VERBI Software, Berlin, Germany).\nWe use the following abbreviations to report qualitative statements: PCP = primary care provider; FG = focus group; I = Interview; S = Survey; F = French; G = German.",
        "results": "Results\nThe survey was completed by 126 PCPs (53% female) and 16 PCPs participated to a focus group or individual interview. The main barriers to BSH deprescribing included patient and PCP lack of knowledge on BSH effects and side effects, lack of PCP education on treatment of sleep problems and BSH deprescribing, patient lack of motivation, PCP lack of time, limited access to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and absence of public dialogue on BSHs. Facilitators included informing on side effects to motivate patients to discontinue BSHs and start of deprescribing during a hospitalization. Main PCP needs were practical recommendations for pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of sleep problems and deprescribing schemes. Patient brochures were wished by 69% of PCPs. PCPs suggested the brochures to contain explanations about risks and benefits of BSHs, sleep hygiene and sleep physiology, alternative treatments, discontinuation process and tapering schemes.\nResults\nStudy population\nThe survey was completed by 126 PCPs, including 51 (40.5%) French-speaking and 75 (59.5%) German-speaking participants; 16 of them had been approached by e-mail, the rest answered following the advertisements and newsletters. Eleven additional PCPs completed the baseline characteristic form but did not answer any additional survey question and were thus not kept for analysis. Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. Of the 126 PCPs, nine participated to an FG (all of them German-speaking) and seven (six French-speaking, one German-speaking) to an individual interview. Fourteen did not provide contact information. The average duration was 26 min for the interviews and 41 min for the FGs.\nTable 1:\nBaseline characteristics (N = 126)\nPCP work routine concerning BSH deprescribing\nOne hundred and sixteen (92.1%) PCPs had ever discontinued BSHs in older adults with sleep problems and 86 (68.3%) routinely considered doing it. Eighty-six (68.3%) PCPs reported that they knew where to refer their patients for the treatment of sleep problems and 58 (46.0%) knew where to refer patients for CBT-I.\nBarriers and facilitators to BSH deprescribing\nIn this section, we present the results of the qualitative analysis for which there was no quantitative counterpart, based on the TDF. The TDF domains and constructs that were found during the coding process are displayed in Additional File 1: Appendix Table 3. Below are the domains presented with some examples of the qualitative analysis.\nKnowledge\nThis section reports knowledge of PCPs and patients influencing BSH deprescribing, which was identified as a barrier. Regarding patient knowledge, unrealistic sleep expectations of patients were experienced as a major issue [PCP16, I7, G]: \"... the main problem, it seems to me, is that patients simply need to be able to sleep when it gets dark and nothing is going on, to sleep the whole night if possible, and only wake up again when the day begins.\" Furthermore, PCPs mentioned that their patients lacked knowledge about BSH risks [PCP7, FG1, G]: \"Well, so what I find difficult is, hmm, that patients are not aware that these are problematic drugs. (...) Because, hmm, apparently this was either not communicated when they were prescribed or, which is also quite possible, it [the information] was put aside afterwards.\" Regarding knowledge of PCPs, some PCPs expressed a lack of knowledge about side effects of BSHs [PCP15, FG3, G]: \"And what is the evidence regarding the, hmm, harmfulness of these, hmm, Z-substances?\".\nSkills\nLack of skills was identified as a barrier. PCPs mentioned they had not received enough training on the treatment of sleep problems and BSH deprescribing [PCP13, FG2, G]: \"So it's such a huge problem. I think it would need some kind of course during medical school. And during residency, hmm, definitely too, or simply that it becomes more important. (...) So I think it has far too little importance. Already during the whole training.\"\nMotivation and goals\nBoth barriers and facilitators were classified in this construct. A main barrier encountered by PCPs was patient lack of motivation [PCP2, I2, F]: \"And then when we come to it [discussing BSH deprescribing], well, they don't want to talk about it too much. They avoid the subject and then say, 'Oh no, but we'll do it next time.'\" PCPs didn't consider BSH deprescribing as a priority [PCP12, FG2, G]: \"Of course, it [BSH deprescribing] is also time-consuming. So, in the primary care practice, apparently there are on average over four problems per consultation and, hmm, then you have to think about how to use the time. And if there are three much more important problems, then, hmm, you just look at those.\" Regarding facilitators, some physicians reported using side effects to motivate their patients to discontinue or not to start BSHs [PCP5, I5, F]: \"So, I often talk to them about cognitive impairment and the risk of fall. I think these are really important problems for older adults.\" Beside these side effects, patient fear of dependence was mentioned as a facilitator to discontinue or not to start BSHs [PCP4, I4, F]: \"The fear of dependence too, I think that's also something that, that can be a lever.\"\nEnvironmental context and resources\nEnvironmental context and resources were identified as barriers. Regarding external factors, PCPs experienced lack of time as a barrier to deprescribe BSHs [PCP8, FG1, G]: \"Hmm, what I miss is simply the setting and the peace and quiet to discuss it [BSH deprescribing] with the patient, because that also takes a lot of time, so the quarter of an hour I have in the agenda is often not enough.\" When coming to the prescription of CBT-I, the limited availability and access to it were mentioned as barriers, making prioritization needed [PCP7, FG1, G]: \"But of course, there are too few therapy places, so they are very quickly booked. And, I have to say, I would almost be a bit reluctant to take up such a place for a simple sleep disorder, because there are really many patients with much bigger problems who need it [cognitive behavioral therapy] more urgently.\"\nSocial influences\nLack of public dialogue about BSHs was identified as a barrier, while PCP thought it could facilitate BSH deprescribing [PCP8, FG1, G]: \"And I also think a social dialogue, that these are addictive substances, would be very helpful, because then, hmm, maybe they [the health authorities] would give me more time to deal with it [BSH deprescribing] in peace, to get away from these addictive substances.\"\nEmotion\nSeveral barriers were related to emotions. PCPs said patient fear of not being able to sleep was a barrier to deprescribe BSHs [PCP3, I3, F]: \"The first argument, very often, is, 'No, no, but you can't take away my [BSH] (...) Since I have it, I can sleep. I don't want to disturb that balance. And it's so important for me to sleep, as I've gone through periods with so much insomnia.'\" PCPs reported frustration following repeated failed attempts to deprescribe BSHs to be a barrier to try again [PCP17, S, G]: \"My attempts often or almost always fail. (...) So I don't have the courage to try again.\"\nBehavioral regulation\nSeveral issues related to behavioral regulation were identified as barriers, while other were rather facilitators. PCPs mentioned that costs could impact patient behavior related to BSH deprescribing [PCP18, S, F]: \"Difficulties in getting patients to come back for follow-up consultations. High deductibles, fear of costs.\" On the other hand, it was perceived positively that in Switzerland CBT-I is now covered by universal health insurance [PCP5, I5, F]: \"So, since, since the, hmm, psychotherapy by psychologists started to be covered by health insurance last year, I've really been trying to guide patients by saying, 'Well, now you can have twice fifteen sessions with a psychologist. It's covered by insurance.'\" PCPs experienced patient social situation and interests as a barrier to deprescribe BSHs and implement sleep hygiene measures [PCP14, FG3, G]: \"Hmm, but then we end up slipping into complex social difficulties because the problem is, especially in winter: 'What do you do until eleven in the evening and what do you do at six in the morning?'\".\nNature of the behaviors\nStarting deprescribing at hospital was identified as a facilitator [PCP1, I1, F]: \"If, if they [the physicians at hospital] can remove [BSHs], and, in parentheses, prove that in hospital they [the patients] sleep without, hmm, they can, in parentheses, more easily keep building on that momentum.\" Nevertheless, PCPs made the experience that tapering was often not continued by patients after hospital discharge, which could be addressed by improving continuity of follow-up [PCP5, I5, F]: \"... sometimes, when they [the patients] come out of geriatrics, they come out of a unit where there was a lot of motivated people who managed to, supposedly, wean them off benzos. But when the patients come out, well, they run to the pharmacy to get them [the benzodiazepines]. So, hmm, would it also be necessary for a psychologist to be directly involved in the discharge process? To say, \"Ah, we're going to support you now that you're going home, to prevent a relapse.\" Could it be?\".\nPCP opinions on patient material\nIn this section, we present the mixed methods results about PCP opinions on what could support them and their patients to discontinue BSHs. Meta-interferences are presented in Tables 2 and 3 and complete quantitative survey results in Additional File 1: Appendix Tables 1 and 2.\nTable 2:\nMeta-interference: PCPs opinions on patient material (N = 126)\nTable 3:\nMeta-interference: Needs of PCPs (N = 126)",
        "limitations": "Conclusion\nThe barriers and facilitators as well as PCP needs and opinions on patient material we identified can be used to develop PCP training and material on BSH deprescribing, which could help reduce the inappropriate use of BSHs for sleep problems.\nKeywords: Benzodiazepine, Deprescribing, Mixed methods, Older adults, Primary care, Qualitative, Sedative, Sleep disorder\nAuthor(s): Orlando H\u00fcrlimann1, Daphne Alers1, No\u00c3\u00abl Hauri1, Pascal Leist1, Claudio Schneider1, Lucy Bolt1,2, Nicolas Rodondi1,2 and Carole E. Aubert1,2\nStrengths and limitations\nThis study has several strengths. First, the mixed methods design with deductive and inductive approach allowed a more comprehensive understanding. Second, the inclusion of PCPs of different practice types (single/group practice) and regions (rural/city, French-/German-speaking) increases result generalizability.\nWe must acknowledge some limitations. First, as PCPs who participated to the study are potentially more intrigued to deprescribe BSHs, their opinions might not reflect those of all PCPs. Second, the study was conducted in a single country. Nevertheless, assessing local factors is required for successful implementation. Third, we did not power our study to conduct additional analyses according to baseline characteristics such as age, work status or years of experience. Therefore, except for language, other elements of variation of sample were not considered. Finally, the conduction of both FGs and interviews can be both a limitation and a strength. On the one hand, while FGs might have allowed new thoughts to emerge by discussing with colleagues, participants might also have been hesitant to express divergent opinions in front of colleagues. On the other hand, interviews allowed a more intimate setting to express opinions but the lack of exchanges and stimulation by colleagues might have limited PCP reflections.\nConclusion\nThe identification of barriers and facilitators to BSH deprescribing and particularly of PCP needs to support BSH deprescribing can help develop appropriate materials to reduce the use of BSHs and their adverse effects, as well as training for medical students and board-certified physicians.\nAbbreviations: BSH: Benzodiazepine and other sedative hypnotic drug; CBT-I: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia; F: French; FG: Focus group; G: German; HCP: Healthcare professional (specialized physician and/or non-physician therapist); I: Interview; PCP: Primary care provider; S: Survey; TDF: Theoretical Domains Framework; y: Years\nAcknowledgements: We would like to thank the primary care providers for their participation.\nCorrespondence:\nAuthor details: 1grid.5734.5, 0000 0001 0726 5157, Department of General Internal Medicine, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, , Anna-Von-Krauchthal Weg 7, 3010, Bern, Switzerland. 2https://ror.org/02k7v4d05, grid.5734.5, 0000 0001 0726 5157, Institute of Primary Health Care (BIHAM), University of Bern, , Bern, Switzerland.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nIn this mixed-methods study, we assessed barriers and facilitators as well as needs of PCPs to BSH deprescribing. The identified TDF constructs mostly confirmed existing literature [12, 13]. Main barriers to deprescribing included patient and PCP lack of knowledge on BSH effects and side effects, PCP lack of education on BSH deprescribing and treatment of sleep problems, patient lack of motivation, PCP lack of time, limited access to CBT-I, and absence of public dialogue on BSHs. Facilitators included informing patients about BSH side effects and deprescribing start during hospitalization. The main PCP needs were practical recommendations for pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of sleep problems and deprescribing schemes. For their patients, they wished brochures containing explanations about risks and benefits of BSHs, sleep hygiene and sleep physiology, alternative treatments, discontinuation process and tapering schemes.\nInitiating deprescribing of inappropriate BSHs during hospitalization was mentioned as a potential facilitator. This confirms existing literature, showing hospitalization to be an opportunity to review medication and initiate deprescribing [20, 21]. However, ensuring continuity could be difficult and PCPs mentioned their patients often resumed BSH use after discharge, using the medication they still had at home, the prescription they had before hospitalization, or asking PCPs for a new prescription. Previous research identified concerns about lack of post-discharge follow-up and disagreement between hospitalists and PCPs [18, 20]. This could be improved by enhancing communication around discharge between hospital internists and PCPs, for example by phone contact or electronic communication, and implementing structured care coordination [22]. It is particularly important that hospital internists communicate to PCPs the shared decision made with the patients regarding deprescribing during hospitalization. Further, PCPs suggested promoting public dialogue on BSHs to support deprescribing. However, public campaigns seem only moderately effective to reduce BSH consumption [23].\nNot all PCPs knew where to refer patients for the treatment of sleep problems and CBT-I. Further, lack of CBT-I therapists and CBT-I costs were mentioned as barriers. Limited access to psychotherapy and often insufficient insurance coverage is a widespread problem globally [24, 25]. Absence of psychotherapy reimbursement was previously described as a barrier to deprescribe BSHs [26]. Providing CBT-I therapists contact details to PCPs, PCP training in CBT-I and self-help CBT-I could help address this issue [27, 28].\nRegarding PCP opinions on patient materials, they preferred brochures over online material, to avoid limiting access. Research has shown that patient information leaflets could decrease the number of repeat visits to PCPs and therefore save time but should in no way substitute oral information [29]. Also, the timing of information is relevant [29]. Providing information prior to the consultation could be beneficial and give patients time to consider the benefits [12, 30]. Using patient brochures to support BSH deprescribing was shown to be effective in the EMPOWER trial which tested a pharmacist-led intervention [31]. Generalizability of this trial is however limited because the implementation in pharmacies might not work in healthcare systems, where pharmacists do not conduct medication review or follow patients on a regular basis, especially if physician drug dispensing is allowed, like in Switzerland. Therefore, multilevel interventions including patient information brochures accounting for country-specific differences should be developed.\nPCPs requested online training covering practical recommendations for pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of sleep problems in older people currently using BSH. This is consistent with the reported lack of education on sleep problems and BSH deprescribing during medical school, residency and continuing education. Previous research showed that the term \"deprescribing\" was unfamiliar to medical students and that physician education on BSH deprescribing and insomnia treatment should be reinforced [26, 32, 33]. Online modality of continuous medical education was found to provide flexibility of access in terms of time and geographic location [34]. Furthermore, PCPs wished to complete CBT-I training to implement it in their practice. These findings underline the importance of integrating training on CBT-I and treatment of sleep problems at medical school and in post-graduate training.",
        "conclusion": "",
        "references": "Preferences\nPCPs were asked whether they preferred standardized materials, i.e., where the information and tapering schemes are similar for all patients, or customizable materials, where the information and tapering schemes can be individualized to each patient. Eighty-eight (69.8%) PCPs preferred customizable and 36 (28.6%) standardized materials for patients, while 2 (1.6%) PCPs had no preference.\nFormat\nEighty-seven (69.1%) PCPs mentioned they would find brochures for patients useful and that giving a brochure to the patients to read at home could facilitate deprescribing [PCP2, I2, F]: \"I mean, if there was something we could give our patients so that, in fact, we could already talk about it at the consultation. So that they can read their brochure or not. But it also tells us if the patient is a bit motivated. And then, afterwards, we can discuss it. It would probably save us time.\" Sixty-three (50.0%) PCPs wished documents for relatives, 62 (49.2%) materials for patients with cognitive impairment, and 62 (49.2%) flyers. Figures, apps or websites were thought as less useful.\nContent\nA clear preference was found for explanations about risks and benefits of BSHs, wished by 112 (88.9%) PCPs [PCP2, I2, F]: \"I think what would be important is the, the, that, it's the undesirable effects. So that we, so that they [the patients] understand why we have to change, obviously.\" A majority of PCPs also considered recommendations for sleep hygiene, explanations about alternative treatments and about the discontinuation process, as well as tapering schemes, as potentially helpful. Additionally, PCPs wished explanations about sleep physiology for their patients [PCP5, I5, F]: \"So, I think one of the main elements is to talk about sleep cycles and explain that these micro-awakenings are natural and difficult to avoid. I think there really needs to be this aspect of 'What is normal sleep?', and then, 'What can we expect from sleep?', and then, 'What can't we expect too much of, let's say, with age?'\". A table comparing the effectiveness of the different treatments or testimonials were wished by few PCPs, 50 (39.7%) and 46 (36.5%), respectively.\nPCP needs\nFormat\nConcerning useful resources for PCPs, 79 (62.7%) preferred online training, followed by online documents, information on a website and exchange with colleagues. In-person training, printed documents and apps for smartphone were wished by less PCPs. Regarding training in general, PCPs mentioned that sleep problems were just one relevant topic among lots of others [PCP12, FG2, G]: \"I don't know if we all really need to do so much training now on how to reduce it [BSH use] exactly. But, hmm, maybe a few basics. (...) But we have to, it's so varied, we have to be fit in so many topics and so I wouldn't want to spend half a day just talking about sleep problems, hmm, or.\"\nContent\nPractical recommendations for pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of sleep problems in older people with current BSH consumption were wished by 111 (88.1%) PCPs and deprescribing schemes by 86 (68.3%) [PCP 11, FG2, G]: \"So, I think I would find it very helpful to get instructions on exactly how to proceed. Because I don't have much experience in this area.\" Concerning CBT-I, 72 (57.1%) PCPs wished its implementation into primary care practice. Seventy-seven (61.1%) said they would be willing to receive information about CBT-I and 74 (58.7%) to complete CBT-I training if it was offered. A minority of PCPs (46, 36.5%) wished recommendations for follow-up and information about motivational interviewing (33, 26.2%). PCPs said, a list of therapists offering CBT-I for sleep problems for older adults using BSHs would be helpful [PCP5, I5, F]: \"Well, maybe a list of psychologists who, who willingly take on this type of patients.\"\nReferences\n1.

        "introduction": "The research aim was to find out whether providing information on psychological preparation would produce changes in pre-retirees retirement planning intentions and advance retirement concepts. In the experiment, we divided the pre-retirees (N = 567, mean age of 54.91, SD = 3.55 years, working full-time) into four groups (with and without pre-test, with and without the information provided). There were no differences between the pre-test and post-test conditions. However, the results showed that participants acknowledged the need to prepare for retirement even before the intervention. The participants also rated themselves as psychologically prepared for retirement. The results also indicated which pre-retirees could benefit from psychological preparation: those who believe they would have a disadvantageous and unfavorable retirement transition. The next group is the ones who tend to conceptualize their retirement as an imposed disruption as they also perceive their psychological resources for a successful transition as insufficient.\nKey words: retirement planning, retirement conceptualization, retirement psychological preparation, pre-retirees\nIntroduction\nThe transition from work to retirement involves behavioral and psychological distancing from employment, often accompanied by normative lifestyle changes and other social changes that may affect the well-being and health of newly retired persons (Osborne, 2012; Rodriguez-Monforte et al., 2020). Some research studies in the retirement literature bring to the fore arguments about adverse changes and losses of recent retirees (Pinquart & Schindler, 2007; Wang, 2007; Wang, Henkens, & van Solinge, 2011; Seiferling & Michel, 2017). Lately, a growing number of research studies produced findings indicating positive retirement transition and outcomes (Hansson et al., 2018; Hansson et al., 2020; Henning, Lindwall, & Johansson, 2016; Lindwall et al., 2017; Sohier, van Ootegem, & Verhofstadt, 2021). Retirement research studies estimate that approximately one-third of the retired population has adjustment problems (La Rue, Haslam, & Steffens, 2022). The consent prevails that planning and preparation for retirement contribute to smoother retirement adjustment and more retirement satisfaction (Barbosa, Monteiro, & Murta, 2016; Hurtado & Topa, 2019; La Rue, Haslam, & Steffens, 2022; Topa et al., 2009). Our goal in this research study was to examine whether planning for retirement in pre-retirees can be encouraged by simple psychological intervention. Specifically, we were interested in promoting retirement consideration and planning for all pre-retirees in general by providing alerting information about the changes that retirement will bring to their lives and suggesting ways to deal with them.\nRetirement Preparation through Psychological Interventions\nPsychological preparation for retirement seeks to inform, instruct, coach, consult, and variously equip pre-retirees for adjusting to identity change and new relationships after leaving employment (Noone, Stephens, & Alpass, 2010; Schlossberg, 1981, 2011; Seidl et al., 2021). Since it is aimed at activating and strengthening individual resources, it engages several mental processes and activities, and as a result, can take various forms.\nThe preparatory psychological interventions for retirement aspire to increase well-being in the general population and thus can be qualified as positive psychological interventions (Bolier et al., 2013), as opposed to interventions aimed at reducing symptoms, problems, or disorders (Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009). They belong to low-intensity methods focusing on prevention (Durgante et al., 2020), also allowing individuals to engage in self-help methods (van Agteren et al., 2021). Psychological retirement preparation belongs to wise psychological interventions, which Walton refers to as \"psychological remedies for social and personal problems\" (Walton, 2014; Walton & Wilson, 2018; Walton & Crum, Eds., 2020). Wise psychological interventions target a healthy general population, and they are ordinary, short, and frugal. Their main characteristic is that they are psychologically precise because they target those psychological processes that are most involved in the problem (this is what the adjective \"wise\" is supposed to express, see Walton, 2014). A common feature of all the above approaches is that they target all people, not just those requesting an intervention.\nIn their reviews, Leandro-Franga et al. (2016) and Rodriguez-Monforte et al. (2020) noted the lack of interventions for improving well-being across the retirement transition. The authors analyzed eleven and fifteen articles, respectively, most of which reported positive outcomes. However, a comparison of their impact and effectiveness was hindered by their high variation--in content, duration, target group, method of delivery, and professionals involved. The authors concluded, among other things, that the small number of studies, their heterogeneity, and their medium-low quality did not allow them to formulate valid conclusions and establish whether these interventions prevented frailty. Note that both reviews compared long-running and complex retirement preparation programs.\nAn example of a psychological intervention based on information provision is the theory of transition by Schlossberg and its applications in psychological counseling (Anderson, Goodman, & Schlossberg, 2012; Schlossberg, 1981; Schlossberg, 2011). Its primary goal is to help manage life transitions (including retirement). A transition is a phase of relational and personal changes, including attempts to cope with concerns, anxiety, and efforts to find new sources of support. Four factors influence a person's ability to cope with the changes: Situation, Self, Support, and Strategies. An individual can view a Situation positively, negatively, or as being benign, depending on such issues as how the transition relates to one's social background, which aspects one can control, and how significant are the stresses associated with the necessary changes. Self includes personal and demographic characteristics and psychological resources as coping tools--ego development, outlook, commitment, and values. Social support includes intimate relationships, family, friends, co-workers, and communities. The fourth <S> is Strategies used to control the meaning of the problem and manage stress to help the adjustment without being overwhelmed (Anderson, Goodman, & Schlossberg, 2012; Goodman & Pappas, 2000). Schlossberg's transition theory and models have found wide practical application in counseling adults in their life transitions, including retirement (Schlossberg, 2007, 2009, 2011; Schlossberg & Kay, 2010). The main principle is that the more aspects of coping factors a person identifies in advance, the better he or she is prepared to handle them in anticipatory socialization.\nProviding Psychological Information as Retirement Preparation\nEnsuring adequate information is the first step in all change management strategies (White, 1976). The provision of relevant information is often sufficient for the general population to apply the appropriate procedure and solve personal or/and social problems (Walton, 2014; Walton & Wilson, 2018). As for preparing for retirement, most research studies concentrate on the effect of providing financial information on financial preparation for retirement (Dolls et al., 2018; Hoffmann & Plotkina, 2020; see Birkenmaier, Kim, & Maynard, 2021 for a review).\nIn contrast to financial information, providing psychologically saturated information explores more goals, not just cognitive ones (Walton, 2014). In the case of retirement preparation, the goal is to evoke new meanings ascribed to retirement and retirement transition. The information would draw attention to lifestyle changes fresh retirees will face and set appropriate attitudes and planning orientations for coping with the challenges. Therefore, the information provided should be minimally directive, allow self-reflection, and draw new conclusions about the importance of retirement preparation. Walton & Wilson (2018) refer to this strategy as prompting new meanings. This can be achieved by evoking questions (e.g., how might thinking about retirement be useful to you, your friends, or relatives?), altering situations (e.g., suggesting starting a business instead of a job), or providing new information (e.g., about how many of a person's friends or neighbors are already preparing for retirement).\nTo the best of our knowledge, the effects of providing psychological retirement information have not been examined yet. One recent exception is the study by Gettings and Anderson (2021), which examined the sources of information about retirement, the meanings ascribed to retirement, and associations between sources of retirement information and meaning. However, the participants in this study were young adults for whom preparing for retirement is not urgent.\nWe found a positive psychological intervention tool titled The Transition Guide by Schlossberg and Kay (https://transitionguide. com). It is a self-scoring assessment that helps individuals manage the transition. The Transition Guide prompts individuals to engage in a self-help method to prepare themselves for retirement. It allows pre-retirees to focus their attention on the changes they will face and sets the intention to plan and cope with changes by stating their position in retirement preparedness. Compared to other tools, this tool is accessible, available online, and easy to understand. It provides immediate feedback, and the participant does not need any assistance. We chose and adjusted the Transition Guide in our research as tailored psychological information that can prompt pre-retirees to think about and plan for retirement (see more in the Method section). Providing information about retirement is an essential first step for pre-retirees. For this goal, we considered the Transition Guide a simple and quick tool for the general population of pre-retirees.\nTo learn more about the effect of psychological retirement preparation using a sample of the Slovak pre-retirees, we investigated the impact of the information on retirement planning intention and retirement concepts such as lifestyle expectations in retirement. We chose the four retirement lifestyle concepts by Hornstein and Wapner (1985). Retirement can be seen as a) an opportunity to make a new start, b) prolongation of a pre-retirement lifestyle, c) an unwelcome disruption, and d) a transition to old age. Several studies on retirement succeeded in using these concepts (Bacova & Halama, 2020; Gee & Baillie, 1999; Hanson & Wapner, 1994; Hopkins, Roster, & Wood, 2006). Recently, in newly retirees, research found a positive correlation between retirement satisfaction and the retirement concepts of New Beginning and Continuation, and a negative correlation between retirement satisfaction and the retirement concepts of Imposed Disruption and Transition to Old Age (Bacova, Halama, & Kordacova, 2022).\nThe Current Study\nThis research study is theoretically based on confirmed extended engagement for a predictable and expected retirement transition in pre-retirees (Ekerdt et al., 2001; Ekerdt, Kosloski, & Deviney, 2000). We also refer to the potential precariousness of the retirement transition in the lives of newly retired persons (Pinquart & Schindler, 2007; Wang, 2007; Wang, Henkens, & van Solinge, 2011; Seiferling & Michel, 2017). The study builds on the assumption that providing information is one of the effective forms of psychological intervention (Bolier et al., 2013; Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009; van Agteren et al., 2021; Walton, 2014; Walton & Wilson, 2018).\nBased on these theories and empirical findings, our research aims to verify whether information on psychological retirement preparation will increase pre-retirees' intention to plan for retirement and advance their retirement concepts.\nOur study contributes to the literature in several ways. In particular, we add to the debate on means to increase psychological preparation and interest in retirement planning (e.g., Chan, Chung, & Yeung, 2020). Doing so is essential, as prior work finds a positive association between retirees' satisfaction and pre-retirement engagement (Hurtado & Topa, 2019). The need for psychological retirement preparation is largely confirmed and rightly emphasized (Adams & Rau, 2011). However, given the variability of the psychological resource to manage retirement in pre-retirees, little is known about what forms and durations of such training are sufficient, necessary, and justified (Rodriguez-Monforte et al., 2020). Notably, the role of information in stimulating retirement planning in the general pre-retirees' population is not yet sufficiently investigated (Leandro-Franga et al., 2016). We, therefore, strive to contribute to the answers to a broader question: Do all pre-retirees need psychological preparation for retirement if only some of them are experiencing difficulties in retirement transition? And specifically: Is providing information on psychological issues of retirement efficient enough to increase interest in one's own retirement transition?\nTherefore, in our study, we used a brief online intervention that provided information on the retirement transition, confronted the participants with the changes that retirement would bring to them, and diagnosed their psychological resources for managing these changes.\nHypotheses\nWe hypothesized that the information provided would significantly increase participants' belief that they need to consider and plan retirement and raise their interest in these activities compared to the control groups (H1). Further, we hypothesized that the information provided would increase participants' retirement conceptualizations positively associated with retirement satisfaction (New Beginning and Continuation) (H2). The information on retirement issues would decrease those retirement conceptualizations negatively associated with retirement satisfaction (Transition to Old Age and Imposed Disruption) compared to the control groups (H3).",
        "methodology": "Method\nSample\nA Slovak research agency recruited the participants following three criteria: participants had to be over 50 years old, working full-time, and not retired. The participants responded through an online platform. All participants gave an informed consent before continuing with the survey. In the sample, we included only participants who passed the attention-check items and finished both rounds of the data collection. They received compensation from the research agency for participating in the research. The final sample consisted of 567 Slovak participants with a mean age of 54.91 (SD = 3.55) years, 249 were men (M = 54.83, SD = 3.70) and 318 were women (M = 54.98, SD = 3.43). Mean years until retirement age was 8.20 (SD = 4.08, Mdn = 8). The modal level of education was a high school degree (46.6%), followed by a university degree (33.0%), a vocational school (12.7%), a doctorate or higher degree (3.7%), Bachelor's degree (3.4%), and elementary school (0.7%).\nProcedure\nWe used Solomon's four-group experimental design to assess the plausibility of pretest sensitization effects, that is, to control whether the mere act of taking a pre-test influenced scores on subsequent administrations of the post-test (Braver & Braver, 1988; see Figure 1). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: the intervention group with a pre-test (N = 152), the intervention group without a pre-test (N = 159), the control group with a pre-test (N = 125), and the control group without pre-test (N = 131). Following, all participants answered items about their gender, age, education, retirement proximity, satisfaction with their current job, anticipation of retirement adjustment, and subjective social status. Both pre-test groups completed the retirement consideration questionnaire, retirement planning checklist, and a questionnaire measuring four core retirement concepts. The same measures we used in the post-test. The intervention groups immediately continued with the Intervention Questionnaire (see description below). The participants in the control groups answered 30 items of the short Big Five Inventory 2. We administrated the post-test five days after the pre-test. Our final sample featured only the participants who successfully filled out the post-test within 14 days after the pre-test.\nMeasures\nThe Retirement Consideration Questionnaire was inspired by Ekerdt and his colleagues, who analyzed in detail \"workers' extended engagement with the retirement before the event\" (Ekerdt, Kosloski, & Deviney, 2000). Ekerdt et al. strived to measure the consideration given to retirement by questions that capture the awareness of the topic aiming to determine whether workers think about retirement and whether it comes up in conversation. \"They are not items that ask about planning or preparation behavior in a specific sense, and they are attitudinally neutral. The objective here is to examine whether retirement is topical.\" (Ekerdt, Kosloski, & Deviney, 2000, p. 6). The three retirement consideration questions from a nationally representative survey of persons aged 51 to 61 were as follows: How much have you thought about retirement? How much have you discussed retirement with your husband/wife/partner? How much have you discussed retirement with your friends or co-workers? We expanded these three questions, and our questionnaire consisted of eight items focused on thinking about retirement: \"I'm thinking about what I'm going to do in retirement\", \"Pensions are not a topic that needs to be addressed in advance\", \"I try to avoid the idea of a retirement\", \"Preparing for retirement in advance is unnecessary\", \"One must work on oneself to prepare for a happy and peaceful retirement\", \"People should prepare thoroughly for their retirement\", \"Even before retirement, one should be familiar with everything that one has to consider in retirement\", \"I am interested in how to retire in the best possible way.\" Participants endorsed their agreement with these items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Disagree to Agree. The internal consistency of the questionnaire was adequate: McDonald's [omega] = 0.75 for the pre-test and 0.80 for the post-test.\nRetirement planning was accessed via the modified checklist for plans used by Wang, Worsley, Cunningham, and Hunter (2014). The authors constructed The Checklist for Retirement Plans in two steps. They developed the individual items from people's accounts of their planning behaviors and then produced categories of planning through latent class analysis of their responses to those items. Age, income, problem-solving skills, attitudes toward the future, and the presence of long-term illness significantly predicted retirement planning measured by this checklist in their study. Several studies implemented The Checklist (recently Seidl et al., 2021). We adopted this checklist with all seven items on future retirement planning. However, instead of a dichotomous answer to the items (1 = no, I do not plan, and 2 = yes, I plan) used by Wang et al., we used the 5-point Likert scale items ranging from Disagree to Agree. All items shared the same stem: \"I think that before retiring person needs to plan ... \" and continued with a short phrase: \"where s/he will live\", \"how s/he will keep physically active\", and \"how s/he will keep mentally stimulated\", \"how much money s/he will need\", \"how to ensure his/her income is sufficient\", \"how s/he will meet people outside the family\", \"where s/he will go away from home, or travel to.\" The internal consistency of the questionnaire was strong: McDonald's [omega] = 0.80 for the pre-test and 0.90 for the post-test.\nParticipants' ideas and beliefs about retirement were captured by measuring the four core concepts of retirement lifestyle proposed by Hornstein and Wapner (1985) in their qualitative investigation. Inspired by the authors who translated the qualitatively identified concepts into a questionnaire (Gee & Baillie, 1999; Hanson & Wapner, 1994; Hopkins, Roster, & Wood, 2006), we accessed these concepts using 12 items created solely for the present study. Participants endorsed their agreement with these items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Disagree to Agree. Transition to Old Age was measured by three items: \"I consider retirement to be the end of all work and the enjoyment of a well-deserved rest after a lifetime of effort\", \"Retirement provides an opportunity to end your life peacefully\", and \"Retired people should no longer engage in new activities.\" The last item showed a very low correlation with other items, and the internal consistency was poor ([omega] = 0.46/0.38); therefore, it was omitted. Without this item, internal consistency became more satisfactory ([omega] = 0.59/0.46). New Beginning was accessed by three items: \"Retirement will finally be the time for me to actively pursue my interests\", \"I welcome retirement as a whole new beginning in my life\", and \"The retirement transition will give me new opportunities to take an interest in things I haven't done before.\" The internal consistency of the questionnaire was adequate ([omega] = 0.71/0.77). The Continuation concept was accessed by three items: \"My retirement life will be very similar to my life now\", \"Retirement won't make a big difference in my life\" and \"I plan to live in retirement in the same way as before retirement\". The internal consistency of the questionnaire was adequate ([omega] = 0.77/0.74). The last concept, Imposed Disruption, was accessed by three items: \"I perceive retirement as an unwanted disruption to my previous work\", \"The thought of retiring worries and scares me\", and \"It is difficult for me to cope with the fact that I will have to retire soon.\" Internal consistency was strong ([omega] = 0.82/0.83).\nIntervention Description\nWe used the Transition Guide: A New Way to Think About and Manage Change, a tool for self-scoring assessment developed by Schlossberg and Kay (2010), as an intervention that provides information on psychological preparation. The tool is available online (https://transitionguide.com).\nThe Transition Guide tool contains fifty-six items divided into four sections (Situation, Self, Supports, and Strategies; Anderson, Goodman, & Schlossberg, 2012). As a non-directive way of subtly suggesting the need for retirement preparation, we adapted, reformulated, and shortened the items in the Transition Guide so that the intervention focuses on retirement transition and consists of thirty items. We structured The Intervention Questionnaire into the following five scales: Anticipated intensity of changes induced by retirement, aimed at making participants aware of the intense changes retirement brings, whether good or bad for the participant (five items); Perceived retirement transition consisting of seven items indicating how participants see their retirement transition situation (favorable or unfavorable conditions); Perceived personal strengths (five items) reports on how participants view their strengths (positive qualities); Social support from others (six items) asks what help and support a participant expects from others; and Problem-solving strategies (seven items) shows the strategies the participants have used so far for changing things, negotiating terms, and handling difficulties.\nThe participants responded on 5-point Likert scales according to the content of the items. After each scale, the participants obtained immediate feedback--their scores for the anticipated intensity of retirement changes and the types of psychological resources they could use to cope with them. In the end, participants received an overall score on their psychological coping resources. The entire content of the Intervention Questionnaire is provided in the Appendix.",
        "analysis": "Analyses\nThe data were processed and analyzed using SPSS 22 and jamovi 2.2.5 software (The Jamovi Project, 2021). First, we used a two-way ANOVA to ascertain whether the posttest scores differ for the intervention and control groups, accounting for pre-test sensitization. After that, we focused on the change in the pre-test and post-test using a paired samples t-test, independently for the intervention and the control group. In addition, we analyzed the data from the Intervention Questionnaire. We also examined the connections between the post-test scores of dependent variables and the responses of the participants in the Intervention Questionnaire. Although the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality was significant for the dependent variables used, parametric tests were used considering the number of participants, continuous nature of variables, acceptable skewness and kurtosis (between -1 and 1), and visual inspection of Q-Q plots. Data are available at https://osf.io/qgfmp/?view_only=eca13f0b9c2a4fe69c424d61ff279194\nAnalysis of the Intervention Questionnaire\nThe intervention we used enabled us to assess how participants assess their psychological resources needed for coping with a retirement transition. We could measure how intensively the participants perceived the changes induced by their retirement, their perception of retirement situation, their strengths for adapting to change, the social support they could rely on, and the strategies they used to achieve their objectives. The McDonald's omega for the scales of the Intervention Questionnaire was as follows: Intensity of changes 0.75 (six items), Perceived transition situation 0.74 (seven items), Perceived personal strengths 0.66 (five items), Social support 0.79 (six items), Strategies used 0.65 (seven items; see all items in the Appendix).\nTable 4 presents the descriptives of the scores in the Intervention Questionnaire for the groups without and with a pre-test. There were no differences between the intervention group without and with the pre-test (Cohen's d values were insignificant and ranged from 0.05 to 0.19). Both intervention groups self-assessed their psychological resources for retirement quite highly (in the upper level of the scale ranging from 1 to 5).\nTo gain insight into the relationship between assessing one's psychological retirement resources and retirement concepts and retirement planning intention, we analyzed the relationships between the scales of the Intervention Questionnaire and the dependent variables.\nTable 5 shows that the participants who were more inclined to the retirement concept Imposed disruption perceived the changes that retirement would bring them more intensely. They also perceived their retirement transition situation as unfavorable, their strengths as insufficient, their social support as weaker, and their troubleshooting strategies as less sufficient. On the other hand, pre-retirees inclined to look at retirement as a New beginning showed a more positive perception of their retirement transition situation. They positively perceived their strengths and valued their social support. The two retirement concepts--Transition to old age and Continuation showed similar patterns, except that the Continuation concept was associated with the perception of the lower level of changes brought about by retirement.\nThe other two dependent variables--Retirement consideration and Retirement planning --positively correlated with only one scale of the Intervention Questionnaire. The more participants perceived the intensity of changes brought about by retirement, the higher their scores in the variables Retirement consideration and Retirement planning (Table 5).",
        "results": "Results\nHypothesis Testing\nTable 1 presents the mean and standard deviation for each dependent variable in the compared groups. The participants rated themselves highly in all dependent variables outside the concept of Imposed disruption (in the upper half of the scale; the scales ranged from 1 to 5).\nWe conducted two-way ANOVA for each dependent variable to test our hypotheses (Table 2). The significance was compared to Holm-Bonferroni's corrected alpha for each test (Holm, 1979). The results showed that 1) the pre-test did not have a significant effect on post-test scores, 2) intervention did not have a significant effect on post-test scores, and 3) the interaction of pre-test and intervention was not significant for any of the dependent variables. Thus, regarding our hypotheses, we found that intervention did not have a significant effect on Retirement consideration, Retirement planning, New beginning, Continuation, Transition to old age, or Imposed disruption. Our results did not confirm any of the three hypotheses.\nIndependent and Dependent Samples T-Tests for Groups with Pre-Test\nFirstly, we accessed the pre-test difference between the control and intervention groups. The results showed no significant differences between these two groups, suggesting equal pre-test scores in both groups (Cohen's d ranged from 0.04 to 0.18). Secondly, we focused on the difference between pre-test and post-test scores separately in both groups. We found significantly higher post-test scores for the New Beginning and Continuation concepts in the Intervention group, but the difference was very small for the former and small for the latter. Although we expected an increase in these concepts, it should be noted that there was a slightly lower but still significant unexpected increase in the Continuation concept in the control group as well. After applying the Holm-Bonferroni method, only the difference in Continuation in the intervention group remains significant. Interestingly, we found a small significant decrease in Retirement Planning in the control group. Table 3 presents the results.",
        "limitations": "",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe results did not confirm our hypotheses. Compared to the control groups, the intervention group did not increase their retirement consideration and planning beliefs (H1). Nor did the intervention group advance the retirement concepts of New beginning and Continuation (H2) or decrease the retirement concepts of Transition to old age and Imposed disruption (H3). We found no difference between the pre-tests and post-tests that followed the application of the intervention used. The intervention content, form, and duration were not robust enough to \"persuade\" participants to think more about retirement planning, and the one-time intervention application was not sufficient to \"nudge\" participants into advancing their retirement concepts. The only partial result in the expected direction was that the group reported higher agreement with the concept of Continuation after the psychological retirement information.\nRecent works have not observed significant effects of similar retirement interventions in financial preparation. Hoffmann and Plotkina (2020) investigated when financial information is more likely to improve retirement planning intentions and which consumers are more prone to act on their stated intentions. In a longitudinal study, they found that message format had a limited effect on message effectiveness, but the receipt of a message did improve consumers' intention to plan for retirement. The willingness to learn more about retirement planning and retirement self-efficacy mediated this effect. The authors concluded that financial information was more likely to improve retirement planning intentions when consumers' perceived financial security was low and when such message was congruent with consumers' goal mindset. Their findings were in a similar vein as our results, when the effect of providing relevant information was not sufficient enough.\nAlthough we have made every effort, including a sophisticated experimental design, there are some methodological limitations in the research arrangement in our research. The time between the pre-test, psychological information, and post-test was relatively long (up to 14 days), and this can limit the extent of capturing changes induced by the intervention.\nWe examined a sample of general pre-retirees with diverse backgrounds, and we randomly assigned them to experimental and control groups. It is a strength of the present research that it provides evidence of generalizability. However, the broad age range in the studied samples can be a limitation. As Ekerdt, Kosloski, and Deviney (2000) found the closer the retirement date, the more intense the thinking about retirement. The wide age range of our samples may also have contributed to the fact that the participants could have rejected thinking and planning for a distant retirement.\nAnother possible issue regarding the non-significant results is whether the performed tests had the satisfactory statistical power to detect meaningful changes. Sensitivity power analysis using G*Power software revealed that with a sample of 576 participants and alpha 0.05, we had 80% power to detect effects as small as f = 0.138 for ANOVA and, with groups of 311 (intervention) and 256 (control), d = 0.210 for the t-test. Both of these are small effects (Cohen, 1988), however, with some potential to be consequential for an explanation of events (Funder & Ozer, 2019). We believe that effect sizes lower that these are not meaningful in the context of the study as they would represent only minor changes in dependent variables with no practical relevance for the demonstration of variables. However, this conclusion means that low statistical power was not the problem in our study, and the identified effect sizes represent no intervention effect on retirement intentions and concepts.\nThe nature of the retirement transition also adds to this finding. Transition to retirement is ambivalent. Retirement entails both gains and losses synchronously. The pre-retiree attitudes to retirement transition may also be ambivalent. In previous studies, the participants reported retirement by apprehension and idealization (Genoe, Liechty, & Marston, 2018; Grodem & Kitterod, 2021). Also, the transition period can be relatively long and divided into sub-phases (Wanka, 2019). Different thoughts and emotions associated with retirement may be at the forefront of the future retirees' minds in the sub-phases. Some participants (especially those just over the age of 50) may have been in a phase where retirement issues still felt very far away. Some pre-retirees see retirement as a welcome event. Not all of them feel the need for preparation, and not all are comfortable with the same type of preparation.\nWe can also find help explaining the results of our participants by analyzing their answers to the questionnaires on retirement consideration and retirement planning. All participants' responses, both in the intervention and the control groups, in the pre-tests and post-tests, indicated that they acknowledged the need to plan and prepare for retirement (Table 1). It suggests that our participants may not have needed to be \"persuaded\" into doing some psychological preparation because they already seemed to be \"convinced.\"\nThe analysis of the data from the Intervention Questionnaire also provides us with a key to the results. The responses in the Intervention Questionnaire revealed that the participants thought they had been equipped for retirement psychologically (Table 4). The intervention might only reinforce the participants' pre-existing beliefs about their psychological preparedness for retirement.\nThe fact that the studied population of pre-retirees in a post-communist country still partially lives in the retirement settings of the previous regime, where retirees were taken care of by the patronizing state, may also have contributed to the failure of the intervention. Retirement used to not mean too much change in life except that they received a pension instead of a salary. Although pension was much smaller, their needs also decreased in retirement. Perhaps the same or similar intervention would have different consequences in other socio-economic and cultural settings.\nIn addition to not finding a difference between pre-test and post-test, we found several noticeable links between retirement planning and concepts (dependent variables) and the self-assessment of psychological readiness in the Intervention Questionnaire (Table 5).\nThe participants who anticipated retirement would bring them more intense changes reported a greater need to think and plan for retirement. We also found relationships between retirement concepts and self-assessment of psychological resources for managing retirement. The participants with a higher retirement concept of New Beginning anticipated a favorable transition situation and self-estimated higher personal strengths. By contrast, the participants with a higher concept of Imposed Disruption increasingly anticipated an unfavorable transition, self-estimated lower psychological strengths, and a lower level of expected social support (Table 5).\nOur non-significant findings regarding the impact of the intervention on psychological retirement preparation raise questions about whether all pre-retirees need a psychological guide well ahead of retirement age and under what conditions is psychological preparation for retirement justified. Retirement researchers have only recently become aware of the need for psychological retirement preparation. As far as we know, researchers have not yet explicitly asked questions about the necessary or selective need for psychological pre-retirement training.\nAt the same time, our results offer a key to which pre-retirees could benefit from psychological retirement preparation. They are the ones who believe they would have an adverse and unfavorable retirement transition. The next group are the ones who tend to conceptualize their retirement as an imposed disruption and who also perceived their psychological resources for a successful transition as insufficient.\nIn summary, the form of intervention we used did not increase participants' retirement planning intention nor advance their retirement concepts. However, the Intervention Questionnaire revealed that pre-retiree participants reported thinking about and planning their retirement and perceived their psychological preparedness regardless of the provided intervention.\nSeveral explanations of our non-significant results are possible, and several factors are highly likely to act here simultaneously. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the direction of future research. Some explanation for our insignificant results lies in the intervention used. Its content, form, and length of proceedings were not robust enough. Perhaps the participants knew the contents of the intervention, or it may not have been relevant enough for them for various reasons. A more detailed explanation outside the intervention itself of why the intervention was not effective includes several options as well. Future investigations should focus on determining more precisely which groups of pre-retirees could benefit from the information on the psychological aspects of retirement and why.\nThe main conclusion of our research study is that in utilizing psychological retirement preparation it is more effective to identify early the potential pre-retirement vulnerability, stimulate motivation in participants, and then create an intervention appropriate for the participant's specific needs.\nhttps://doi.org/10.31577/sp.2023.02.871\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education and the Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA) under contract No. 2/0048/18 \"The psychological aspects of the adaptation to retirement\".\nAuthors' ORCID\nViera Bacova\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-3661-208X\nMichal Kohut\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-4544-1331\nPeter Halama\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-6938-4845",

Adapting to these life changes takes time and energy.\nWhat is key to a satisfactory retirement transition?\nAlthough the transition to retirement differs for each person, the steps that have to be taken are quite similar.\nExperts have developed three steps to facilitate this change. The procedure has been validated in many countries for many people of pre-retirement age.\nStep 1: Familiarize yourself with the changes that await you\nThink about how retirement will change your life. Regardless of whether the transition is positive or negative, it may stress you out. For example, you may experience feelings of loss when you leave work and your co-workers, or insecurity about your new status in the family.\nPlease indicate the extent to which you assume retirement will change your life, regardless of whether it is good or bad:\nYour score: ...\nThe closer your score is to 5, the more the retirement transition will change your life. It is therefore more important that you undergo greater psychological preparation for retirement.\nIn all cases, the following questions will help you cope with the changes retirement brings.\nStep 2: Evaluate the resources you have to cope with the changes in retirement\nEach of us has four resources that we can use:\nA. Situation (favorable or unfavorable conditions),\nB. Your personality (your positive qualities),\nC. Other people's support,\nD. Strategies for changing things, negotiating the terms, and handling the difficulties.\nBy answering the following questions, you will find out which resources you need to cope with your retirement.\nYou will find your result at the end of the questions.\n(A) For the following items, indicate how you see your retirement transition situation:\nYour score: ...\nThe closer your score is to 35, the more favorable your retirement situation is likely to be. If you score less than 14, this is a weak area.\n(B) For the following questions, indicate what you perceive your strengths to be:\nYour score: ...\nThe closer your score is to 25, the higher your chances of adjusting well to the changes that retirement brings.\nIf your score is less than 10, this is a weak area.\n(C) For the following questions, indicate what help and support you have from others:\nYour score: ...\nThe closer your score is to 30, the more support you will be able to get when you retire. If your score is less than 12, this area is weak.\n(D) For the following questions, indicate the troubleshooting strategies you use:\nYour score: ...\nThe closer your score is to 35, the more you will be able to use different strategies to achieve your goals, so you will have a better chance of adjusting to the changes that retirement brings. If your score is less than 14, this area is weak.\nSummary of your skill-set for successfully coping with the life changes brought about by retirement\nStep 3: Take responsibility for your retirement transition\nWe find it easier to get through each stage in life if we are aware of our assets and liabilities and develop an \"action plan\". Even doing just a little bit of preparation for retirement can improve your sense of well-being and control over events.\nBased on your resource summary, come up with some suggestions to improve some of the \"weaker\" areas in your retirement preparation.\nHere are some inspiring ideas on how you can prepare for and handle your retirement.\n* Strive to see the positive aspects and positive results.\n* Find out what kind of experiences other people in your profession have had with retirement.\n* Recognize that feelings of loss and grief are normal and last for a while.\nIdeas for your action plan\nWrite down three steps you can take to improve a low or medium score in one of your resource areas:\n1. ... ....\n2. ... ...\n3. ... ....\nViera Bacova [1] [ID], Michal Kohut [2] [ID], Peter Halama [1] [ID]\n[1] Institute of Experimental Psychology, Centre of Social and Psychological Sciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 841 04 Bratislava, Slovak Republic\n[2] Faculty of Philosophy and Arts, University of Trnava, Hornopotocna 23, 918 43 Trnava, Slovak Republic\nCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to Viera Bacova, Institute of Experimental Psychology, Centre of Social and Psychological Sciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 841 04 Bratislava, Slovak Republic.

        "introduction": "I examined the relationship between algorithmic control and gig workers' facades of conformity by investigating the underlying mechanism. Drawing on the challenge--hindrance stress model, I explored the mediating role of challenge stress and hindrance stress in this relationship. Then, by using data collected from an online food delivery platform in China, I demonstrated that hindrance stress positively mediated the relationship between algorithmic control and facades of conformity, but the mediating effect of challenge stress was not significant. This study contributes to the emerging research field of algorithmic control by not only empirically examining its effect on gig workers' psychological and behavioral outcomes, but also exploring the underlying mechanisms between algorithmic control and gig workers' facades of conformity. It offers a reference point and guidance for managers of gig economy enterprises.\nKeywords\nalgorithmic control, facades of conformity, challenge stress, hindrance stress, gig workers\nOver the past decade, the rapid growth of the gig economy has made significant contributions to both domestic and global labor markets (Vallas & Schor, 2020). This emerging form of contingent labor has attracted numerous gig workers who prefer flexible employment (Kuhn & Maleki, 2017). To effectively manage these gig workers, who are dispersed geographically and in large numbers, platform companies have implemented algorithms that utilize various computational formulas (Duggan et al., 2020; Vallas & Schor, 2020). These algorithms employ statistical models and decision rules to direct gig workers without human intervention (Cheng & Hackett, 2021; Kellogg et al., 2020). While algorithmic control can impact gig workers' behavior, its effects can be both positive and negative (Cram et al., 2022; Mohlmann et al., 2021). On the one hand, algorithmic control is considered objectively and mathematically correct, providing customized feedback to help workers improve performance (Crowston & Bolici, 2019). On the other hand, continuous algorithmic monitoring of gig workers and limited flexibility to deviate from instructions have been perceived as a threat to gig workers (Kellogg et al., 2020; Lee, 2018; Mohlmann et al., 2021; Tomprou & Lee, 2022). Given the importance of the gig economy and the potential impact of algorithmic control, it is essential to explore and understand its outcomes.\nThe adoption of facades of conformity is a common phenomenon among gig workers. Facades of conformity refer to situations where individuals outwardly express support for their organization's values while suppressing their own (Hewlin et al., 2016). Previous research indicates that these facades are more prevalent among individuals who perceive their work environment as nonparticipative or who belong to a minority group. It is also reasonable to assume that gig workers, who often work independently and are directed by algorithms, may be susceptible to such facades. While scholars have started examining gig worker's attitudes and behaviors, such as work identity and status inconsistency (Petriglieri et al., 2018), there has been limited attention given to facades of conformity among gig workers. These facades can deplete physical and psychological resources, leading to emotional exhaustion (Chou et al., 2020), low job satisfaction, and a desire to leave the organization (Hewlin, 2009). Therefore, I aimed to investigate the relationship between algorithmic control and gig workers' facades of conformity, as well as to understand the underlying mechanisms.\nDrawing on the challenge-hindrance stress model, I examined why gig workers exhibit facades of conformity under algorithmic control. Challenge stress, which creates opportunities and a sense of achievement, and hindrance stress, which involves demands that hinder one's performance and personal goals, are two distinct types of stress that impact an individual's attitudinal and behavioral outcomes (Cavanaugh et al., 2000). Shi et al. (2022) have additionally demonstrated that daily challenge stress has a positive influence on work engagement, whereas daily hindrance stress has no effect on work engagement. Hence, I posit that the indirect impact of algorithmic control on facades of conformity may differ depending on whether gig workers perceive algorithmic control as challenge stress or hindrance stress. With this in mind, I discuss the mediating effects of challenge stress and hindrance stress on the relationship between algorithmic control and gig workers facades of conformity, based on the challenge-hindrance stress model.\nTheory and Hypotheses\nAlgorithmic Control\nAlgorithmic control is \"an organization's attempt to influence worker behavior by using digital algorithms to enact the control (e.g., to identify a worker behavior that needs to change) and then delivering the control to the work by a technology interface (e.g., smartphone app)\" (Cram et al., 2022, p. 429). Different from organizational control, algorithmic control is based on a computational formula (Duggan et al., 2020; Vallas & Schor, 2020), and it typically relies on ubiquitous and embedded technologies (i.e., mobile apps, smartphones, sensors; Cram et al., 2022). Embedded within digital platforms, algorithms are used to manage gig workers through task assignment, performance evaluation, and compensation. Kellogg et al. (2020) proposed that employers employ algorithms to exert control over workers through six main mechanisms: providing specific recommendations for gig workers' actions, imposing restrictions on gig workers' behaviors, collecting and analyzing data in a detailed manner, utilizing online rating and ranking systems, automatically replacing or removing underperforming workers, and incentivizing behaviors that align with predetermined correct behaviors.\nAlgorithmic Control and Facades of Conformity\nHewlin et al. (2016) stated that facades of conformity are \"false representations created by employees to enable them to appear as if they embrace organizational values\" (p. 541). When organizational values conflict with individuals' values, employees will exhibit conscious behaviors to pretend to support organizations' values and exhibit false behaviors that organizations needed. Recently, related studies investigated the causes of facades of conformity from the work context and individuals' psychology. For example, leader integrity (Hewlin et al., 2015), job insecurity (Hewlin et al., 2016), job strain and workplace bullying (Liang, 2021) have been determined to relate to employees' facades of conformity.\nGig workers who work under algorithmic control may use a facade of agreement (conformity) to obey the rules and demands of the platform. Vallas and Schor (2020) describe the situation where algorithms now fully manage workers and empower firms to an even greater extent as a digital cage. Constant surveillance is used to monitor workers' behaviors, and algorithmic replacement and reward systems are also established for discipline (Kellogg et al., 2020; Rosenblat, 2018). When gig workers do not comply with directives or their rating drops below a certain level, they are banned or punished (Rosenblat, 2018). Additionally, the interactive and dynamic reward depends on the consistency of their behaviors and the predefined correct behaviors (Goods et al., 2019; Rani & Furrer, 2020; Wood et al., 2019). Hence, gig workers must obey the predefined demands even if they do not agree because they need to conform to algorithmic control to gain rewards and avoid punishment.\nHowever, some studies have proposed that gig workers thrive under algorithmic control (Ashford et al., 2018). Although the structural conditions of algorithmic control decrease gig workers' organizationally provided resources, gig workers can attain and maintain their personal resources through career-related behaviors (i.e., resilience and proactivity) and relational behaviors (Ashford et al., 2018). These resources (cognitive capability and emotional capability) enable gig workers to resolve problems proactively and increase their ability to thrive. In addition, many researchers have found that algorithmic control is perceived as fair (Hughes et al., 2019; Jabagi et al., 2020; Shin & Park, 2019; Wong, 2020). With the absence (or minimization) of bias and discrimination, and the accuracy and appropriateness of decisions, algorithms are considered credible and will increases gig workers' trust (Shin & Park, 2019). Given their trust in algorithms, gig workers may commit to the platform company and strive for high performance. I believe that in this case they will not display facades of conformity as that is considered a negative behavior.\nAs such, there may be an underlying mechanism leading to different effects of algorithmic control on gig workers' facades of conformity. In this study I simultaneously consider a positive and a negative path between algorithmic control and facades of conformity based on the model of challenge and hindrance stress to reveal the influential process and deepen understanding of algorithmic control.\nAlgorithmic Control and Gig Workers' Feelings of Work Stress\nCavanaugh et al. (2000) proposed that job demands can be divided into challenge stress and hindrance stress. When individuals feel work demands as challenge stress, the demands will exert potential positive influences on personal gain, growth, development, and well-being. In contrast, when individuals feel work demands as hindrance stress, the demands will result in personal loss, constraints, or harm (LePine et al., 2016), and the individuals will be demotivated to achieve their goals and experience low job satisfaction (Shi et al., 2022). In other words, only when the demands are viewed as challenge stress will individuals respond positively and invest more time and energy in their work. Through algorithms, job demands are transmitted to gig workers. On the one hand, algorithmic control is positively related to challenge stress. First, algorithms are considered fair and impartial (Lee, 2018; Shin & Park, 2019; Wong, 2020). If gig workers obey the demands and complete the work assigned to them, they can gain rewards and be promoted (Wong, 2020). Second, although algorithmic control provides strict criteria (such as completing tasks in a fixed time and banning drunken driving) to regulate gig workers' behaviors, these demands can encourage gig workers to improve their work efficiency and ensure their safety (Kellogg et al., 2020). Third, algorithmic control often provides gig workers with timely feedback to help them resolve problems at work and remind them to improve work quality (Parent-Rocheleau & Parker, 2022; Wallace et al., 2009). In addition, a series of competitive work games have been designed in algorithms to encourage workers to challenge themselves and earn more (Cram et al., 2022). These algorithmic demands can increase gig workers' income, improve their work efficiency, and promote their challenge appraisal. Accordingly, I proposed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: Algorithmic control will be positively related to challenge stress.\nOn the other hand, algorithmic control can elicit gig workers' feelings of hindrance stress. First, continuous surveillance has been blamed for invading gig workers' privacy (Ayyagari et al., 2011). For example, Uber tracks drivers' activities closely, including where they go and what route they take (Mohlmann et al., 2021). In addition, drivers' age, gender, education level, and criminal convictions are monitored via algorithms (Sessions et al., 2021). These demands inhibit gig workers from changing their work habits or working outside the rules. Second, gig workers often work independently, which increases their sense of loneliness and tension during work (Wood et al., 2019). They attempt to communicate with one another to obtain a sense of belonging and organizational identification (Mohlmann et al., 2021; Rosenblat, 2018). Third, to keep pace with technological changes, algorithms add new functions and update the operating system irregularly. The continuous change may provide more rigorous demands and require that gig workers learn new skills and knowledge constantly, which may increase their pressures and strains (Curchod et al., 2020). Based on these arguments, I proposed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2: Algorithmic control will be positively related to hindrance stress.\nWork Stress and Facades of Conformity\nAs mentioned, challenge stress and hindrance stress are two categories of stress that have differing effects on individuals: Challenge stress is considered motivating, inspiring, and challenging, and hindrance stress is demotivating (Cavanaugh et al., 2000). When algorithmic control is perceived as a form of challenge stress, the demands placed on gig workers are viewed as meaningful, valuable, and rewarding (Liu & Ren, 2022; Xia et al., 2020). Consequently, I believe gig workers are more likely to respond positively and allocate additional time and resources to successfully accomplish their assigned tasks. The completion of each task and the achievement of goals can increase gig workers' confidence (Shi et al., 2022). Previous research has verified that challenge stress is associated with individuals' positive outcomes such as job satisfaction, work engagement (Shi et al., 2022), positive affect, and career initiative (Liu & Ren, 2022). Thus, I proposed that gig workers who consider algorithms control as challenge stress will not create facades of conformity, which is a type of negative behavior. They will be more likely to engage in their work and eager for higher performance and will not passively treat the assignment task. Thus, I proposed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 3: Challenge stress will be negatively related to facades of conformity.\nIn contrast, I propose that when gig workers consider algorithmic control as hindrance stress, they will be likely to exhibit facades of conformity. The work assigned by algorithms will be considered unmanageable and unattainable. In this case, gig workers will experience nervousness and become pressured if they cannot obey the demands and complete the work because they will be punished or even fired. To increase their awards and obtain better impressions, gig workers will attempt to use impression tactics to influence the evaluation of algorithms. Thus, gig workers feeling hindrance stress will tend to suppress their values, conform to the rules and measures of algorithms, and exhibit fake behaviors (i.e., facades of conformity) to earn their rewards. Therefore, I proposed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 4: Hindrance stress will be positively related to facades of conformity.\nDrawing on the challenge-hindrance stress model (Cavanaugh et al., 2000), I propose potential mechanisms between algorithmic control and gig workers' facades of conformity. Specifically, I suggest that algorithmic control may cause gig workers to feel challenge stress and hindrance stress. In turn, the feeling of hindrance stress may result in gig workers' facades of conformity, while the feeling of challenge stress may be not related to facades of conformity. Therefore, I proposed the following two hypotheses:\nHypothesis 5: The indirect effect of algorithmic control on gig workers' facades of conformity through challenge stress will be positive.\nHypothesis 6: The indirect effect of algorithmic control on gig workers' facades of conformity through hindrance stress will be negative.\nThe theoretical model is shown in Figure 1.",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants and Procedure\nTo test the model and hypotheses in this study, a survey instrument was developed and distributed to delivery persons from an online food delivery platform in China called Meituan. The data collection took place during May and August 2022. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, questionnaires were distributed online. I contacted a region manager in a big city in central China, and he agreed to provide help. A total of 245 riders participated in the survey. I adopted a two-wave study to minimize common method bias, and the participants were told that the questionnaires were anonymous and only for academic research purposes.\nAll procedures in this study were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of Taiyuan Institute of Technology, as well as the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its subsequent amendments, or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants in the study.\nIn the first-wave survey, participants were invited to provide their demographic information (gender, age, education level, and daily work hours) and the survey measured their algorithmic control and facades of conformity. I collected 228 questionnaires. One month later, I conducted the second-wave survey among these respondents, and measured challenge stress and hindrance stress. A total of 214 questionnaires were returned. After excluding fifteen responses with incomplete information, the final sample consisted of 199 useful responses. Among the respondents, 149 (74.9%) were men and 50 (25.1%) were women. In terms of age distribution, 4 (2.0%) of participants were below 20 years old, 44 (22.1%) were aged 21-25, 42 (21.1%) were 26-30, 51 (25.6%) were 31-35, 33 (16.6%) were 36-40, and 25 (12.6%) were 41 or above. Regarding the educational background of the participants, 95 (47.7%) had obtained a high school education or lower, 37 (18.6%) possessed a vocational or technical school education, 43 (21.6%) held a college degree, 22 (11.1%) held a bachelor's degree, and 2 (1%) had a postgraduate degree. Among the participants, 37 (18.6%) reported working fewer than 8 hours per day, 102 (51.2%) worked between 8 and 10 hours, and 60 (30.2%) worked more than 10 hours per day.\nMeasures\nThe surveys were initially developed in English, so I translated them to Chinese using the back-translation procedure developed by Brislin (1980). All items in this study were assessed using a five-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).\nAlgorithmic Control\nI measured algorithmic control using the eleven items from an output control measurement model proposed by Weibel et al. (2016). A sample item is \"Algorithms tell me about the level of achievement expected on sales volume or market share targets.\" Cronbach's alpha was .93, indicating that the measure was reliable.\nChallenge Stress and Hindrance Stress\nI adopted a five-item and a four-item scale developed by Cavanaugh et al. (2000) to measure challenge stress and hindrance stress, respectively. A sample item for challenge stress is \"I have huge responsibility,\" and a sample item for hindrance stress is \"Politics rather than performance always affects organizational decisions.\" Cronbach's alpha for challenge stress and hindrance stress were .85 and .79, respectively, indicating that the measures were reliable.\nFacades of Conformity\nI employed the six-item scale by Hewlin (2009) to measure gig workers' facades of conformity. A sample item was \"I behave in a manner that obeys algorithms' demands even though I do not agree with them.\" Cronbach's alpha was .75, indicating that the measure was reliable.\nControl Variables\nThe gender, age, education, and daily work hours of the participants in this study were controlled to reduce false results caused by probable effects of demographic characteristics, as done in previous research on facades of conformity (Chou et al., 2020; Liang, 2021).\nValidity and Reliability\nFirst, I conducted a series of confirmatory factor analyses to assess the discriminant validity of the key variables used in the study. I employed an item-to-construct balance technique (Little et al., 2002) to create item parcels of algorithmic control, which included three parcels (two parcels containing four items each, and one parcel containing three items). Other variables were not parceled because of having too few items. A hypothesized four-factor model was compared with three alternative models, and, as shown in Table 1, it produced a better fit than alternative models with perceived algorithmic control, challenge stress, hindrance stress, and facades of conformity items.\nSecond, the descriptive statistics of the variables are presented in Table 2. The results indicate that all reliability estimates (the Cronbach's alpha values) for the variables exceed .7. Also, composite reliability and average variance extracted index (AVE) indicated good convergent validity. According to Table 2, the square root of AVE for each variable was greater than the correlations between pairs of constructs, providing evidence of discriminant validity (Fornell & Larcker, 1981).",
        "analysis": "",
        "results": "Results\nTable 2 shows the means, standard deviations, and correlations of all the variables. The results indicated that algorithmic control was positively correlated with challenge stress and hindrance stress, and hindrance stress was positively correlated with facades of conformity. These results supported Hypothesis 1, Hypothesis 2, and Hypothesis 4, respectively.\nI conducted structural equation modeling with Mplus 7.0 to test Hypotheses 1-4. The model included four latent variables. In line with Hypotheses 1-4, the proposed model was tested by including algorithmic control, challenge stress, hindrance stress, and facades of conformity. This model showed satisfactory fit to the data for the mediated and direct links between algorithmic control and facades of conformity, [chi squar]/df = 1.02, comparative fit index = .99, Tucker-Lewis index = .99, root-mean-square error of approximation = .03, standardized root-mean-square residual = .05. Standardized coefficient estimates associated with Hypothesis 1-6 are presented in Figure 2. Algorithmic control was positively related to challenge stress and to hindrance stress. Thus, Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 were supported, respectively.\nAs shown in Figure 2, hindrance stress was positively related to facades of conformity, thus Hypothesis 4 was supported. However, the coefficient between challenge stress and facades of conformity was not significant, thus Hypothesis 3 was not supported. Although the direct link between algorithmic control and facades of conformity was not significant, a mediation model without this direct link was tested. This mediation model also achieved a better fit to the data.\nFinally, I conducted bootstrapping analyses to confirm the mediating role of challenge stress and hindrance stress, respectively (see Table 3). The results of bootstrapping analysis, k = 5000, revealed that the indirect effect between algorithmic control and facades of conformity through hindrance stress was significant. Thus, Hypothesis 6 was supported. However, the indirect effect between algorithmic control and facades of conformity through challenge stress was not significant. Thus, Hypothesis 5 was not supported.",
        "limitations": "",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nDrawing upon the framework of challenge-hindrance stress, I investigated the effect of algorithmic control on gig workers' facades of conformity via the indirect effects of challenge stress and hindrance stress.\nFirst, the results of this study contribute to the literature on algorithmic control, which is an emerging research area. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the gig economy and algorithms, with several studies focusing on theoretical research. For instance, investigations have examined the activities performed by platforms (Vallas & Schor, 2020), the impact of algorithmic management on job design (Parent-Rocheleau & Parker, 2022), and the exploration of a research agenda for employment relations and human resource management (Duggan et al., 2020). Only a few scholars have adopted empirical methods to study the effects of algorithmic control, such as Wiener et al. (2021) and Cram et al. (2022). Contributing to the limited empirical research, my study investigated the relationship between algorithmic control and gig workers' facades of conformity, which is an important and negative behavior that relates to low job satisfaction (Chou et al., 2020). In addition, I have expanded the understanding of the outcomes of gig workers who work under algorithmic control. While previous studies have suggested the positive or negative impacts of algorithmic control, they did not concentrate on specific types (e.g., facades of conformity) of gig workers' actions. It is a significant gap, as Hewlin (2009) discovered that the facades of conformity could boost members' plans to exit the organization. This research examined the indirect consequences of algorithmic control on gig workers' facades of conformity and uncovered the underlying mechanism, which enhances the knowledge of the effects of algorithmic control.\nSecond, my study contributes to the challenge-hindrance stress model (Cavanaugh et al., 2000) by revealing an important psychological mechanism to explain the effect of algorithmic control on gig workers' negative behaviors. Prior research adopted the challenge-hindrance stress model to explain the antecedent of employees' behaviors and performance (Mitchell et al., 2019). From the perspective of individuals' feelings of stress, this study finds that the feeling of hindrance stress due to algorithmic control can incur a positive effect on facades of conformity, but the relationship between the feeling of challenging stress and facades of conformity is not significant. These findings contribute to the research on gig workers and provide a clear view of the influence of algorithmic control on gig workers' psychology and behaviors. In addition, this study has found that algorithmic control can promote both challenge and hindrance stress, consistent with the observation that most work demands can elicit a mix of positive and negative stress in individuals (Bliese et al., 2017; Nelson & Simmons, 2003).\nThird, this study broadens the understanding of the antecedents of facades of conformity. Although previous studies have found that workplace behaviors, such as compulsory citizenship behavior, workplace bullying, and insecure attachment, significantly influence facades of conformity (Cheng et al., 2022; Liang, 2021), they did not focus on algorithmic control as a specific management model. In response to the call by Hewlin et al. (2016) for more research to deepen the understanding of facades of conformity, my study investigated the direct and indirect effects of algorithmic control on gig workers' facades of conformity. The results support my hypotheses and complement the literature on facades of conformity from the perspective of algorithmic control.\nThis study provides some valuable implications for platform companies and gig workers. With the increasing development of the gig economy, algorithms are used more and more to manage gig workers. It is important to know how to utilize algorithmic control to regulate gig workers' behaviors. First, platform companies should optimize algorithmic management, such as enhancing protection measures to prevent disclosure of gig workers' privacy, increasing the transparency of the algorithmic process, and designing more convenient feedback channels for gig workers. These approaches may increase gig workers' trust and improve their work willingness. Second, platforms should pay attention to gig workers' psychological health and improve algorithms to increase work interest, such as conducting mental health surveys, designing recreation games online, or organizing entertaining activities, which will prevent emotional exhaustion in gig workers and increase their well-being.\nThis study has several limitations. First, although the research explores the effect of algorithmic control on facades of conformity via stress, boundary conditions were not considered, which may influence the mediating effects. Future research could address this limitation by examining factors such as gig workers' proactive personality (Bergeron et al., 2014), algorithm transparency (Shin & Park, 2019), and the environment characteristics (Iqbal et al., 2021) to revisit the impact of algorithmic control on gig workers' behavior. Second, the data used in this study were obtained from only one source, introducing the possibility of common method variance. To mitigate this limitation, future research could collect data from multiple sources and levels. Third, the generalizability of my findings is constrained as the data were collected exclusively from gig workers in China, whereas attitudes towards algorithmic control may vary among individuals in different countries. To enhance the external validity of my findings, future researchers could conduct surveys among gig workers from diverse countries.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (21BGL146), Taiyuan Institute of Technology Scientific Research Initial Funding (2022KJ067), and Program for the (Reserved) Discipline Leaders of Taiyuan Institute of Technology (2020XKRW02).\nThe author declares no conflict of interest.",

        "introduction": "The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is an assessment tool designed to measure one's learning history with respect to preexisting verbal relations (Bames-Holmes, Hayden, Bames-Holmes, & Stewart, 2008). Responses to stimuli are regarded as implicit because they are measured with respect to the associated response latencies and accuracy, or brief and immediate relational responding (BIRRs; Hughes & Bames-Holmes, 2013, p. 104). This study used the modified (MD) IRAP to select stimuli that were presented in motivational statements in a simulated work task to increase cooperative and conformity responding. Participants came into contact with customized motivational statements promoting cooperative and conformity responding in conditions with a competing pay-for-performance contingency using an alternating treatments design. Results showed that motivational statements temporarily increased cooperative and conformity responding. Moreover, those participants identified as having a stronger history with particular stimuli, as identified in the MD IRAP, chose to cooperate and conform at higher and more sustained rates. The coherence between implicit responding, as demonstrated in the MD IRAP, and explicit responding, as demonstrated in the simulated work task, and the implications it has on prosocial behaviors will be discussed.\nKeywords Cooperation * Conformity * Rule-governed behavior * Motivative augmentals * IRAP\nIntroduction\nOrganizations have largely relied on consequential payment manipulations to increase particular employee behaviors. Indeed, scholars have found that increased performance is often tied to a financial consequence (Rafacz, Houmanfar, Smith, & Levin, 2019). In addition, motivational messages in analog work settings have been shown to enhance financial consequences when the message is relevant to the behavior that produces a financial consequence (Candido, 2013; Rafacz et al., 2019). For example, motivational messages promoting cooperation between participants have been shown to increase cooperative behavior when the financial contingency to cooperate is aligned (e.g., cooperation results in positive financial consequence). When a motivational message to cooperate with a partner does not cohere with a financial consequence (e.g., cooperation results in no financial consequence and working alone results in a financial consequence), cooperative behavior only temporarily increases (Candido, 2013; Rafacz et ah, 2019). Messages that promote a certain behavior at the expense of a particular consequence can also be seen outside of organizational settings. Some social settings may promote cooperative behaviors that are eventually rewarded but compete with immediate individual consequences. For example, volunteering is regarded as cooperative behavior and often occurs without any immediate programmed, tangible reinforcer and may conflict with direct individual consequences (Brayko, Houmanfar, & Ghezzi, 2016). Voting behavior and political participation are also regarded as examples of \"conditional cooperation\"--cooperating only if those around us are willing to do the same (Rolfe, 2012). However, donating time or money to an organization or voting rarely results in contacting the immediate consequences of our behavior (e.g., end result of volunteering, reaping benefits of elected politician) and may compete with the direct individual consequences for doing so (e.g., loss of time, money).\nCooperative behavior as defined by behavior analysts requires \"the combined behavior of two or more organisms\" (Keller & Schoenfeld, 1950, p. 357) wherein \"the reinforcement of two or more individuals depends upon the behavior of both\" (Skinner, 1953, p. 311). However, maintaining cooperative behavior (e.g., employee engagement, volunteering, voting) with no clear shared outcome and at the expense of individual immediate tangible consequences may not fit the behavior analytic definition of cooperation. In formal terms, two individuals may appear to be behaving in cooperation, but behavior analysts might argue that the direct-acting contingency is a verbal consequence that lacks a shared outcome, which is considered a necessary variable in many definitions of cooperation (Guerin, 1994; Hake & Vukelich, 1972; Schmitt, 1984).\nThe probability that an individual will cooperate when a shared outcome is absent has been studied in other fields of psychology, including social psychology. Romano and Balliet (2017) studied the conditions under which people cooperated in a prisoner's dilemma task and found that cooperation was more likely when the behavior was reciprocated with a partner rather than when cooperation was promoted as conforming to a group norm with no partner reciprocity. When participants were told that their partner had been cooperative on previous trials, but the group had not been promotive of cooperation, participants were more likely to cooperate based on their partner's behavior and not the history of the group. Reciprocity assumes a shared outcome that is not achievable by one individual acting alone, which fits the behavior analytic definition of cooperation (Guerin, 1994; Hake & Vukelich, 1972; Schmitt, 1984). However, conforming to group norms in order to promote cooperation may not fit a behavior analytic definition of cooperation. Conforming as an explanation for cooperative behavior lacks a shared outcome contingent on two or more individuals behaving, but may help to explain those behaviors that were previously regarded as cooperative (e.g., employee cooperation at the expense of individual compensation). Verbal behavior may also help to explain the conditions under which an individual conforms when no direct-acting consequence or reciprocity is apparent. For example, an individual may generate the rule, \"If I cooperate, I am a good employee\" or \"If I vote for X, then I am part of this group.\" In this context, the consequence for engaging in a particular behavior is being a good employee or being part of a particular group, which reinforces the rule follower's behavior. This is in contrast to engaging in a particular behavior that is contingent on another individual and results in a shared outcome. Therefore, some behaviors that have been regarded as cooperative may be better explained as conformity, behavior maintained by a social influence.\nAlthough there is a large research base in behavior analytic journals regarding cooperative behavior, we are mainly limited to social psychological research on conformity behavior that is ambiguous and neglects to consider contextual factors (Padalia, 2014). One growing area of research in behavior analysis that looks at the role socially mediated consequences have on mle-govemed behavior is the study of generalized pliance (O'Conner et al., 2019; Ruiz et ah, 2019; Tomeke, Luciano, & Salas, 2008). Generalized pliance, like the social psychological conceptualization of conformity, is behavior that becomes insensitive to direct-acting contingencies wherein \"social approval becomes the main source of reinforcement for the individual\" (Ruiz et ah, 2019, p.190). In a recent study on generalized pliance, O'Conner et ah (2019) found that scores on the Generalized Pliance Questionnaire (GPQ) strongly correlated with results on two measures of insensitivity to contingencies: the Wisconsin Sorting Test (WCST) and the Contingency-shifting variant Iowa Gambling Task (csIGT). Participants who reported higher levels of \"pliant rule-following\" (p. 837) on the GPQ were less likely to be sensitive to the changing contingencies in the WCST and csIGT. Measures like the GPQ and the IRAP allow behavior analysis to contribute substantially to the experimental analysis of rigid socially mediated rule-following (i.e., generalized pliance) commonly referred to as conformity, and the implications this analysis may have on large-scale social issues.\nConformity from a Social Psychological and Behavior Analytic Perspective\nAlthough there are many definitions and subtypes of conformity found in the social psychological literature, Crutchfield (1955) defined conformity as \"yielding to group pressures\" (p. 193). Since then, social psychological research has distinguished between two motivational factors for conformity: informational and normative factors (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955). Social psychologists have since held to these two conceptually independent factors, however interrelated (David & Turner, 2001). In 2004, Cialdini and Goldstein added an additional motivational factor to account for the conditions under which one conforms, which the authors refer to as \"maintaining selfconcept\" (p. 611).\nWe can analyze these three motivational factors from a behavior analytic perspective that further highlights the interrelation and helps to draw a distinction between conformity and cooperation. Cialdini and Goldstein (2004) define informational conformity as \"the desire to form an accurate interpretation of reality and behave correctly\" (p. 606). Several studies (Asch, 1951; Jenness, 1932; Meade & Roediger, 2002; Walther et al., 2002) have looked at how participants conform to information supplied by confederates when \"reconstructing their memories for stimuli\" (Cialdini & Rosenstein, 2004, p. 606). If we describe behavior analytically, explicit information derived from the group (confederates) serves as an antecedent prompt to occasion the \"correct\" response in the presence of some discriminative stimulus. Information from the group serves as a stimulus prompt that operates directly on the antecedent stimulus directing an individual to a correct response (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007). In this instance, the stimulus prompt is necessarily social as it is the social environment that may punish a select \"bad\" behavior (i.e., incorrect) and reinforce \"good\" behavior (i.e., correct; Skinner, 1953). What is considered the \"correct\" response is not necessarily the direct consequence of behavior but rather the socially mediated consequences of responding in agreement with the group.\nCialdini and Goldstein (2004) define normative conformity as \"the goal of obtaining social approval from others\" (p. 606). Individuals engage in normative conformity to \"gain the social approval of others, build rewarding relationships with them, and in the process, to enhance their self-esteem\" (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004, p. 610). Similar to informative conformity, an individual behaves with respect to some antecedent stimulus in order to come into contact with a reinforcing consequence, in this case a group-provided social consequence. Skinner (1974) discusses conformity as it pertains to differentially reinforcing individual behavior through community standards. The community thus functions as a reinforcing or punishing environment. The social environment steps in to punish certain behaviors or reinforce certain behaviors. The presence of the group therefore serves as a motivating operation and alters the reinforcing value of responding in accordance with the group. If a particular behavior produces reinforcement (e.g., social approval or negative reinforcement) it will increase the current frequency of that particular behavior (i.e., conforming).\nSelf-concept, or the goal of maintaining a positive selfconcept, are instances when \"people are frequently motivated to conform to others' beliefs and behaviors in order to enhance, protect, or repair their self-esteems\" (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004, p. 611). Being \"right\" as it relates to a conceptualized group is therefore highly valued. To address this factor, as well as informational conformity and normative conformity, we look to Relational Frame Theory (RFT) and one's listener-generated rules and values with respect to rule-governed behavior. If an individual is primarily controlled by socially mediated consequences like being \"right\" or values being part of a particular group, then conforming is reinforcing. Correspondence between behavior and rules about what is \"right\" is based on a history of arbitrary socially mediated consequences (Hayes, Bames-Homes, & Roche, 2001). This may lead to ineffective behavior as an individual may behave as \"they ought to\" rather than tracking the short- and longterm consequences of such rule following (O'Conner et al., 2019; Ruiz et al., 2019; Tomeke et al., 2008). Although rulegoverned behavior under the control of a history of socially mediated consequences is not problematic (for a the discussion on pliance, see Hayes et al., 2001), an arbitrary relation of coordination between being \"accepted,\" \"right,\" \"good,\" and verbally constructed consequences related to socially mediated consequences may strengthen one's repertoire of ineffective and rigid rule-following and insensitivity to changing contingencies (O'Conner et al., 2019; Ruiz et al, 2019; Tomeke et al., 2008). Conforming therefore involves characteristics of verbally mediated contingencies of group practices and social consequences regarding mle-govemed behavior. As a result, social consequences may ultimately prevail and prevent sensitivity to the direct consequences of behavior, hindering a transition from pliance to tracking (O'Conner et al., 2019; Tomeke et al., 2008).\nCooperation from a Social Psychological and Behavior Analytic Perspective\nSocial psychologist Morton Deutsch defines cooperative relations as \"those in which the goals of the parties involved are predominately positively interdependent\" (Deutsch, Coleman, & Marcus, 2006, p. 5). This definition encompasses two specific similarities with several behavior analytic definitions of cooperation. \"Positively interdependent goals of parties\" assumes 1) two or more individuals behaving to 2) produce a shared outcome not achievable by one behaving alone (Guerin, 1994; Hake & Vukelich, 1972; Keller & Schoenfeld, 1950; Schmitt, 1984; Skinner, 1953, 1974). Deutsch et al. (2006) organized cooperative relations into six groups that make cooperation more likely: the conditions under which someone engages in cooperative behavior. The two characteristics that draw a parallel to the behavior analytic definitions of cooperation are effective communication and sense of agreement.\nEffective communication is \"when ideas are verbalized, and group members are attentive to one another, accepting of the ideas of other members, and influenced by them ... which lead to mutual benefits\" (Deutsch et al., 2006, p. 5). Deutsch et al. explain that effective communication results in group members having less difficulty communicating and understanding communication within the group. The behavior analytic explanation of \"effective communication\" is that rules are explicitly or implicitly verbalized and effectively relate to the consequence. Similar to Hake and Vukelich's (1972) definition of cooperation, effective communication involves more than one person, acting in accordance with one or more individuals that results in the group contacting similar consequences. Cooperative behavior in this instance requires both parties to behave to produce an outcome one cannot obtain by behaving alone. The direct-acting contingency, therefore, for cooperating with effective communication is the natural consequence stated in the rule. From an RFT perspective, behavior is, \"under the control of the apparent correspondence between the rule and the way the world is arranged,\" the behavior that is specified in the rule produces the consequence that was also specified in the rule (Hayes et al., 2001, p. 109).\nSense of agreement is \"a basic sense of similarity in beliefs and values, as well as confidence in one's own ideas and in the value that other members have to those ideas\" (Deutsch et al., 2006, p. 6). One's values, and the listener-generated rules related to those values, align with others in the group. Group members share similar values, and therefore a potential shared outcome, or as Guerin (1994) defines cooperation: \"Cooperation is controlled by remote contingencies contacted by group members and only by group members acting in concert\" (p. 127). Whether the contingency is direct or remote, behavior is performed and some joint consequence is contacted. For example, collaborating with a colleague on a project results in a shared outcome with a direct contingency (e.g., the completion of the project) and a remote contingency (e.g., praise or recognition from leadership to you and your colleague).\nThe Distinction between Conformity and Cooperation\nFrom a behavior analytic point of view, the distinction between conformity and cooperation seems to be functional, not formal. Conformity and cooperation can be considered two types of social behavior (e.g., helping, sharing, altruism, competition). The distinction, however, may be that cooperation is to achieve some shared outcome not achievable by one individual behaving alone (cooperation as defined by Guerin, 1994; Hake & Vukelich, 1972; Keller & Schoenfeld, 1950; Schmitt, 1984; Skinner, 1953, 1974). In the case of conformity, there is no clearly shared outcome between two or more individuals behaving. One instead comes under control of a particular social influence and acts accordingly, wherein the outcome can be entirely abstract, verbally constructed, and socially mediated. A potential outcome of conformity includes a general sensitivity to consequences provided by others (perceived or real) and insensitivity to the direct outcome or consequences of behavior, what behavior analysis refers to as generalized pliance (O'Conner et al., 2019; Ruiz et al., 2019; Tomeke et al., 2008). Conformity behavior is more susceptible to rigid rule following given an individual's history of responding under the control of socially mediated consequences that may lead to maladaptive rule following. Cooperative behavior is associated with variation in individual responding (see effective communication above) to produce a shared outcome. Therefore, cooperative behavior is more susceptible to flexible rule following, sensitive to changing contingencies, and the factors involved to produce commensurate consequences.\nRafacz et al.'s (2019) looked at the effect motivational statements had on responding in the presence of changing financial contingencies. The study presented motivational statements in an analog medical data entry task that promoted cooperative responding (defined as \"fix partner errors\") as opposed to working independently (defined as \"working alone\"). Conditions were arranged such that a cooperative response in one condition resulted in a neutral financial contingency (profit share: \"fix partner errors\" or \"working alone\" choice resulted in money), and in another condition a cooperative response resulted in a competing contingency (piece rate: \"working alone\" choice only resulted in money). Results showed that in the presence of a motivational statement promoting cooperative responding, participants were more likely to select \"fix partner errors\" in conditions when the financial contingency to do so was neutral. When in a condition where the direct-acting financial contingency was promotive of working alone, motivational statements had little to no effect on participants selecting to \"fix partner errors\" and were more likely to select to \"work alone.\" In sum, the authors found that participants were more likely to be sensitive to the direct-acting financial contingency rather than a socially mediated rule (motivational statements) to cooperate.\nIn line with Rafacz et al.'s (2019) experimental procedure, this study considered a response cooperative when a participant selected to \"fix partner errors\" and a response as independent when the participant selected to \"work alone.\" In this study, however, the financial contingency was modified wherein the piece rate financial contingency to \"work alone\" was held across experimental conditions. Therefore, in all experimental conditions with a motivational statement a cooperative response to \"fix partner errors\" never resulted in a positive consequence whereas an independent response of \"work alone\" always resulted in an immediate positive financial consequence. Similar to Rafacz et al.'s findings, participants who 1) initially selected \"fix partner errors\" but quickly transitioned to \"work alone\" or 2) exclusively selected \"work alone\" were considered to be responding to the direct-acting contingency. Unlike Rafacz et al.'s findings, this study identified participants who maintained their selection of \"fix partner errors\" rather than transition to the alternate response to \"work alone\" in the presence of a competing financial contingency. These participants may have been responding to a social influence, in particular the motivational message presented in the condition and were insensitive to the direct financial contingency.\nFunctional Account of Rule Governed Behavior and Motivative Augmentals\nWhether the other individual or partner was physically present or not, a cooperative or conformity response involved one individual behaving with a stimulus that functionally substituted for another individual. Given that this study focused on the conditions under which cooperative and conformity messages functioned as rules, specifically motivative augmentals, conformity and cooperative behavior in these instances were verbal. Examining how verbal rules affect behavior can be analyzed through an RFT lens (Hayes et al., 2001). RFT provides a liinctional account of rule-governance and the conditions under which rules influence behavior. Through transfer of stimulus function, verbal stimuli come to act as rules that, \"represent 'contingency specifying' and 'functioning altering' stimuli\" (Kissi et al., 2017, p. 2). According to RFT, there are at least three distinct classes of mle-govemed behavior: pliance, tracking, and augmenting (Hayes et al., 1989, p. 203). Based on previous research (Candido, 2013; Maraccini, Houmanfar, & Szarko, 2016; Rafacz et al., 2019), analyzing cooperative and conformity behavior using the framework of augmentals was most appropriate. Augmenting is defined as \"rule-governed behavior under the control of apparent changes in the capacity of events to function as reinforcers or punishers\" (Hayes, 1989, p. 206) and \"is most important for the establishment of abstract consequences such as fairness, justice, peace, or righteousness\" (Hayes, Gifford, & Hayes, 1998, p. 262). Augmentals fall under two classes: formative and motivative. A motivative augmental is rulegoverned behavior that is controlled by, \"relational networks that temporarily alter the degree to which previously established consequences function as reinforcers or punishers\" (Hayes et al., 2001, p. 109). For example, an employee is working on a complex and difficult work task and as their boss passes the employee's desk the boss says, \"Hard work and dedication is the backbone of this company.\" If this verbal stimulus temporarily increases the likelihood that the employee continues to work on the task and work even harder on the task, then it is likely the verbal stimulus is functioning as a motivative augmental. The role of motivative and formative augmentals as related to organizational applications (e.g., buy-in, work productivity, retention) has received growing attention of researchers and practitioners in behavior analysis (Houmanfar, Rodrigues, & Smith, 2009; Maraccini et al., 2016; O'Hora & Maglieri, 2006; Rafacz et al., 2019; Stewart, Bames-Holmes, Bames-Holmes, Bond, & Hayes, 2006).\nThe distinction between cooperative stimuli and conformity stimuli and their potential to function as motivative augmentals may have important implications in workplace settings and large-scale social issues (e.g. employee productivity, political participation, policy adherence). Although cooperative responding has been shown to increase when participants are paid to cooperate (for a discussion of this in profit sharing conditions, see Rafacz et al., 2019), promoting meaningful behavior change in an organization and beyond requires more than financial and consequential contingencies as a sole intervention (Candido, 2013; Maraccini et al., 2016; Rafacz et al., 2019). The verbal history of an individual arbitrarily relating stimuli must be considered when assessing a person's likelihood to respond (e.g., cooperate or conform) in a given situation.\nRelational responses are regarded as learned operants that include an individual's discrimination of the relevant functional relationship between two or more stimuli (e.g., \"cooperating makes me a good person\"; Hayes et al., 2001, pp. 22-24). Moreover, implicit responses are considered relational responses, learned from interactions with stimuli in the environment over multiple exemplars. When a stimulus is presented, a relational response may occur relatively quickly, for example, seeing the stimulus \"cooperation\" and immediately thinking, \"I'm cooperative!\" These quick relational responses are known as brief and immediate relational responses (BIRRs) and can be assessed using the IRAP. Relational responding is considered explicit when the individual who is responding to stimuli (e.g., motivational message to cooperate in an analog work task) has a \"sufficient\" amount of time to alter their response (in general, 3 s or more). These delayed responses are known as extended and elaborated relational responses (EERRs; Bames-Holmes et al., 2010a, b). Both BIRRs and EERRs can be part of the same behavioral process of arbitrary relational responding, but under different time parameters. The Relational Elaboration and Coherence Model (REC) argues that the verbal community reinforces coherence between implicit and explicit relational responding, and punishes incoherence (Bames-Holmes et al., 2010a, b). Previous research has shown that a stronger reinforcement history with a cooperative verbal stimulus (e.g., \"team player\"), as identified in the IRAP, the more likely a person will respond cooperatively following the presentation of that verbal stimulus embedded in a cooperative message in an explicit analog work task (e.g., \"being a team player is highly valued\"; Candido, 2013). Rafacz et al. (2019) also found that participants were more likely to cooperate in conditions when cooperation was aligned with a positive financial consequence and less likely to cooperate in conditions when the financial consequence was promotive of working alone. In addition, cooperative messages were found to only temporarily (if at all) increase cooperative responding in those conditions when cooperative behavior did not result in a positive financial consequence.\nThis study extended the abovementioned research (Rafacz et al., 2019) by introducing in addition to cooperative motivational statements, motivational conformity statements to assess an individual's level of cooperation or conformity responding (e.g., selecting to \"fix partner errors\") under a competing financial contingency in an analog work task. By introducing conformity statements, the authors sought to increase the probability a participant would select \"fix partner errors\" based on a more explicit socially mediated consequence for doing so (e.g., compliance is highly valued). The study also examined the function of the motivational statements as motivative augmentals. Motivative augmentals, when interacting with other rule-governed behavior (i.e., tracking or pliance), decrease the sensitivity to changing contingencies and instead increase the sensitivity and reinforcing value of more abstract controlling consequences (Tomeke et al., 2008). In Phase 1 of the experiment, a modified IRAP was used to identify each individual's history with specific cooperative and conformity stimuli in order to select the top two stimuli from each list that evoked a strong positive relational response. These stimuli were used to generate individualized motivational statements for each participant in the second phase. In Phase 2, participants completed an analog data entry work task with conditions that presented personalized motivational statements meant to promote cooperative or conformity responding with a financially competing contingency and choice behavior was measured (fixing partner errors vs. working alone).",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants and Setting\nA power analysis was conducted to establish the necessary sample size to determine statistically significant effects using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). A baseline effect size was determined using data from Candido (2013), which provided a reasonable estimate of the relative magnitude of the effects to be measured in this study. Subsequent to establishing the likely effect size and design of study, an a priori power analysis (G*Power; Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, & Lang, 2009) was performed for a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures. The results indicated a recommended sample size of 20 or more participants.\nParticipants were 67 undergraduate students. Forty-seven (70%) participants were female, 19 (28%) participants were male, and 1 participant (1%) did not disclose the gender to which they identify. Sixty-two (93%) participants were between the ages 18 and 25. Participants were compensated with extra credit (3 credits), and the dollar amount they earned during the Phase 2 data entry task. All sessions were conducted in two small laboratory rooms on a university campus containing two desks and two PC desktop computers.\nPhase 1: IRAP\nThis experiment involved two different phases (MD IRAP and data entry task). Phase 1 required participants to complete an MD IRAP using stimuli within cooperative and conformity response classes, based on the results from an IRAP stimuli survey. An IRAP stimuli selection survey was included as classes of stimuli are \"critical in determining the internal reliability and predictive validity of the IRAP\" (Hughes & Bames-Holmes, 2013, p. 115). Minor differences in stimuli can have subtle changes on IRAP performance, thus making stimuli selection integral. Therefore, a more systemic and objective method for stimuli selection was warranted. A threequestion online Qualtrics[C] survey was created asking participants to rank from strongest (1) to weakest (10) synonyms that best describe the terms: \"conforming with others\" and \"working with others\" (see Table 1 for survey results). Participants for the IRAP stimuli selection survey included 355 undergraduate students who were compensated for their participation with extra credit (1 credit). The top four words from each category were selected and used in an MD IRAP based on the closest mean to 1, or strongest association to the terms \"conforming with others\" and \"working with others.\" Those students who participated in the IRAP stimuli selection survey were excluded from participating in this study.\nThe IRAP is an empirically validated assessment tool that measures the latency and consistency of the participants' responses to a given set of stimuli presented on a computer screen (Bames-Holmes et al, 2008). Previous work using the IRAP captures the implicit attitudes of participants and the predictive utility of those results in relevant experimental settings (Bames-Holmes et al., 2010a, b; Candido, 2013; Cullen, Bames-Holmes, Bames-Holmes, & Stewart, 2009; Drake et al., 2010; Jackson et al., 2016; Ju & Hayes, 2008; McKenna, Bames-Holmes, Bames-Holmes, & Stewart, 2007; Murphy, MacCarthaigh, & Bames-Holmes, 2014; Rafacz et al., 2019). In the present study, an MD IRAP provided an account of the listener's history with respect to various verbal stimuli that potentially have acquired a cooperative or conformity function, however similar the response may topographically appear.\nModified (MD) IRAP\nThe MD IRAP is the product of an ongoing translational research program that builds on Smith (2013), and subsequent collaboration between the Performance System Technologies Laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the University of Nevada, Reno Medical School. The MD IRAP incorporates variations of the standard IRAP (Bames-Holmes et al., 2008) and the mixed-trial IRAP (Levin, Hayes, & Waltz, 2010) in an attempt to remediate some of the methodological issues presented by the standard and mixed-trial IRAP. This variation of IRAP still relies on the block-byblock hypothesis introduced by the traditional IRAP but addresses the limitations of the block design by isolating stimulus relations in a randomly presented order. Such a design permits investigative flexibility when it comes to designing stimuli. Specific trials are presented more than once within a given block, but the practice phase blocks of the modified version use a different set of practice target stimuli, along with the same two categorical/evaluative stimuli, such that the repeated practice exposures to test stimuli from the traditional version are eliminated within the current version. In addition, what distinguishes the MD IRAP from the standard and mixed-trial IRAP, is the way by which the MD IRAP accounts for responses that do not meet either accuracy (incorrect) or latency criteria. Rather than simply recording responses that are either incorrect or too slow and including them in the final data set of latencies for analysis, the program recognizes a response that does not meet one or both of the criteria and then quasi-randomly re-presents that specific trial later in the same block. The process is repeated as necessary during each block, such that the final data set for analysis includes only responses that are specific to the targeted relation (i.e., correct responses) and are emitted under sufficient time pressure to drive the implicit responding effect. Similar to list-level analyses, raw response latencies are transformed into D-IRAP scores, but the transformation follows a slightly different procedure. The D-IRAP scores for each target stimulus are calculated using the response latencies for that specific target stimulus and each of the evaluative/categorical stimuli (i.e., \"Comfortable\" and \"Uncomfortable\") across all test blocks of trials. For example, each relation is presented three times: \"Comfortable and Team Player\"--Yes/Agree; \"Comfortable and Team Player\"--No/Disagree. The mean latency is calculated for Yes and No responses, respectively. The standard deviation is then calculated from those trials combined (agree and disagree responses), and the difference between the two means is divided by that standard deviation. Thus, the same equation is applied, but instead of taking block means, stimulus means are used for each response type.\nThe MD IRAP provided the assessment of participant's individual responding when presented with the four cooperative and four conformity stimuli identified in the IRAP stimuli survey (see Table 1). Presented on the computer screen with the target stimuli was one evaluative word (\"comfortable\" or \"uncomfortable\") and two accuracy words (\"yes\" and \"no\") wherein participants responded using a keyboard key press to make their accuracy response (see Appendix for an example). Instructions were provided for the participants at the beginning of each trial block, which indicated the relationship with which they were to respond (e.g., comfortable or uncomfortable) to a particular set of stimuli (e.g., cooperative stimuli).\nFor example, the target stimulus \"team player\" and the attribution stimulus \"comfortable\" were presented in a trial block with instructions to respond comfortably to cooperative stimuli. If a participant emitted the response \"yes\" quickly, it suggested a stronger relationship with that particular target stimulus. A response of \"no\" would have been considered an inaccurate response. The MD IRAP began with two practice blocks to familiarize the participants following by six testing blocks, alternating between three consistent and three inconsistent blocks. This resulted in four different IRAP trial types and provided the researcher with information relevant to responding for each. Participants had to pass the two practice blocks and test blocks by responding under 3 s and with at least 80% accuracy. An IRAP effect in the testing blocks was determined by subtracting the mean response latency for the hypothesized consistent blocks from the mean response latency for the inconsistent blocks. This difference is said to reflect the \"differences in the probabilities of the two patterns of responding, as established in the preexperimental history of the individual\" (Bames-Holmes, Bames-Holmes, Luciano, & McEnteggart, 2017, p. 437).\nParticipants who responded with shorter latencies in IRAP test blocks that presented a consistent relation (e.g., cooperation/comfortable) as compared to an inconsistent relation (e.g., cooperation/uncomfortable) were assumed to have a stronger history of reinforcement with that stimulus-stimulus relation. In other words, it was expected that words with shorter latencies and more consistent patterns of responding would have an additive effect when presented in other contexts (Hughes & Bames-Holmes, 2013). The successful completion of both practice and test blocks of the MD IRAP was required to move on to Phase 2. Participants were allowed two attempts to successfully complete the MD IRAP.\nPhase 2: Data Entry Task\nParticipants were given a short break (5 m) after the completion of the MD IRAP in order for the researcher to analyze each participant's D-IRAP scores and subsequently embed them into the Phase 2 motivational statements, and then were brought back to complete the second phase of the experiment, the analog medical data entry task. A flowchart of the experimental procedure can be seen in Figure 1.\nExperimental Design and Independent Variables\nTo examine the differential, functional outcomes of verbal stimuli functioning as motivative augmentals, customized statements based on each participant's MD IRAP results were systematically introduced in a simulated EKG medical data entry task (see Appendix for a screenshot of data entry task). Using each participant's two strongest and positive stimuli from each list, cooperative and conformity motivational statements were presented during the task to see if the stimuli with the highest relative strength in the MD IRAP influenced a participant's likelihood to cooperatively respond. Cooperate or conform in this instance was selecting the button \"fix partner errors\" as opposed to working independently and selecting the button \"work alone\" in the presence of a conflicting financial contingency.\nPhase 2 was an alternating treatment design that included eleven 3 m conditions ([ABACD.sup.1][CE.sup.1][CD.sup.2][CE.sup.2]). Each participant encountered the same experimental conditions; however, within each condition, participants were exposed to the stimuli specific to their MD IRAP results (in the D and E conditions). In other words, researchers calculated the participant's four highest D-IRAP scores (two for cooperation, two for conformity) to embed into that participant's EKG data entry task in the D and E conditions.\nDuring the first three conditions (ABA), all participants were exposed to the EKG data entry task in the absence of motivational or neutral statements. Condition A was a piecerate contingency and Condition B was a pay-for-time contingency. The purpose of the first three conditions was to not only assess a rate of responding in the absence of statements, but also for participants to come under stimulus control of the two financial contingencies. See experimental procedure for details on financial contingencies.\nDuring the latter eight conditions, [CD.sup.1][CE.sup.1][CD.sup.2][CE.sup.2], the financial contingency from the previous condition (A, piece rate) was held constant and the presentation of statements were introduced. Neutral statements were presented first and alternated between motivational statement conditions in order to assess for any change in condition effects from the ABA conditions, carry over effects from previous motivational statement conditions, and to examine the additive effects of the motivational statements on cooperative and conformity responding, when compared to the presentation of neutral statements. Condition C represented the alternating neutral statements, \"Paying attention is highly valued\" and \"Staying on task is highly valued.\" Condition D1 represented a participant's strongest cooperative motivational statement (e.g., \"cooperation is highly valued\"), Condition E1 a participant's strongest conformity motivational statement (e.g., \"Fitting in is highly valued\"), Condition [D.sup.2] a participant's second strongest cooperative motivational statement (e.g., \"collaboration is highly valued\") and Condition [E.sup.2] a participant's second strongest conformity motivational statement (e.g., \"compliance is highly valued\"). In the [CD.sup.1][CE.sup.1][CD.sup.2][CE.sup.2] conditions the neutral and motivational statement scrolled at the bottom of the screen for the entirety of the 3-m condition, regardless of what button was selected. At the end of each condition a feedback screen appeared that provided the participants a report of how many screens they processed fixing partner errors, working alone, and how much money they made in that condition. This manipulation was conducted to determine the effects of cooperative and conformity responding in the face of a competing financial contingency to work alone and earn more money.\nIndependent variables included the manipulation of financial contingencies in the ABA conditions (piece rate and pay for time) and the neutral and motivational statements during intervention conditions, [CD.sup.1][CE.sup.1][CD.sup.2][CE.sup.2].\nDependent Variables\nDependent variables included the response allocation of the cooperative or conformity option (fixing partner errors) and the individual response option (working alone) across each condition, and measures of productivity across each condition (number of correct and incorrect EKG data screens processed). Motivative augmentals are concerned with the temporary alteration of a consequence functioning as a reinforcer. The temporary effect of the predicted motivative augmental (i.e., motivational statements) must then show that a choice was made immediately following its presentation in order to be considered a motivative augmental. Therefore, looking at choice order within each 3-m condition was analyzed.\nFor Phase 2 a secondary dependent measure of eye tracking for the first 29 participants was used to correlate the frequency and duration of a person's eye gaze directed at a particular stimulus on the computer screen within their EKG data entry task. Tobii Studio[R] is a technology that detects gaze on a screen based on the biological functioning of the eye (Tobii Technology, 2010). Two of the metrics produced by the Tobii Studio[R] software that controls the eye tracker device used in this study were fixation duration (i.e., the time in seconds of each fixation on a particular area of the screen) and fixation frequency (i.e., the number of times a participant looks at a particular area of the screen). The researchers defined specific areas on the screen (areas of interest; AOI), and the Tobii Studio[R] software calculated the total eye fixation duration and frequency included in those areas. The AOIs identified on the computer screen were the \"fix partner error\" button, \"work alone\" button, and the scrolling motivational or neutral statement. The AOIs and the size of the AOIs for all participants were the same (see Appendix for a screenshot of EKG data entry task including AOIs). Duration and frequency were selected as measures of eye gaze as they directly correlate to the primary dependent variables of choice count of working alone and fixing partner errors. Eye tracking offered an additional secondary measure to choice count measures (e.g., frequency of \"work alone\" and \"fix partner errors\") and postexperiment questionnaire data related to attending and behaving with respect to the motivational statements on the screen. Research in the communications field suggests that eye-tracking technology is an objective measurement of attention and a means to measure message \"retention\" (Crosswell & Porter, 2016; Crosswell, Porter, & Sanders, 2017; Maughan, Gutnikov, & Stevens, 2007; Siefert et al., 2008). In addition, eye-tracking technology has been used in advertising research to evaluate \"advertising effectiveness by revealing insight into the perceptual and cognitive processes that influence consumer decisions\" (Crosswell, 2013, p. 39). With the addition of eye-tracking data to this particular line of research, and behavior analytic research in general, a correlational and interactional relationship can be made between physiological findings (e.g., eye gaze) and observable behavior (e.g., choice count). In addition, a postexperiment questionnaire was administered.\nPhase 2: Experimental Procedure\nThe experimenters first read a script to participants detailing how to perform the EKG data entry task. In the instructions, participants were told that they were working with a partner to review and compare patient heart rates and rhythms against normal ranges and that they would receive whatever money they earned within the task. One 2-m practice trial with no financial contingency or statements was required to ensure participants understood how to complete the task. The experimenter remained in the room during the practice trial to answer any questions related to the EKG data entry task. Once the practice trial was complete, the eye-tracking equipment was activated for the first 29 participants. To do this, participants had to follow a red dot on the computer screen for approximately 10 s in order for the equipment to calibrate to the person's line of sight. No explanation was given to participants with respect to the eye-tracking software and no participant asked for any explanation. Following calibration, the experimenter left the room and the participant began the experimental phase of the EKG data entry task.\nThe EKG data entry task was an analog data entry task designed to simulate a medical record-processing task. The task involved the participant choosing between radio button options that categorized a patient's heart rate and QT interval (heart rhythm). New, fictitious patient information including the patient's name, date of birth, age, gender, patient ID number, heart-rate measurement, and QT interval appeared for each data screen processed. Based on this information, the participant had to identify the patient's heart rate and QT interval as being above, below or within a specified range by selecting two buttons, one for heart rate and one for QT interval. For example, a patient's listed heart rate and age was compared to a normal heart rate for a specified age range and participants had to select the correct option as being above, within, or below the specified range. Participants had to make two responses (heart rate and QT interval) for each trial and then click a \"submit\" button to complete the trial (see Appendix for a screenshot of data entry task).\nPrior to the beginning of each trial, participants had to select a button marked \"start work session\" which began that 3-m condition. Following the initial selection to \"start work session,\" two additional buttons marked \"work alone\" and \"fix partner errors\" appeared indicating whether the person was going to behave individually or cooperatively, respectively. After an option was selected, fictitious patient information then appeared and participants were required to fill in the necessary medical entry information. If \"work alone\" was selected, participants completed the medical task \"from scratch\" (i.e., the response options were blank). If \"fix partner errors\" was selected, a medical entry screen appeared with patient information completed but that had errors to be corrected (i.e., both response options were already filled in and either one or both were incorrect). After all fields had been completed or corrected, the participant clicked the submit button and the \"work alone\" and \"fix partner errors\" buttons reappeared. On the screen at all times was a timer counting down from 180 s so that participants were aware of how much time was left within that condition. In addition, a money-earned text box was always present on the screen indicating the amount earned in that condition.\nParticipants received feedback after each submission with a large red \"X\" if the submission was incorrect. Submitting records correctly in the piece-rate conditions resulted in $.02 for every data entry screen completed but only when choosing the \"work alone\" button. Data entry tasks that were submitted within the piece-rate condition that were \"fixing partner errors\" did not result in any financial consequence. Therefore, the only way to earn money in a piece-rate condition was to select the \"work alone\" button. Pay-for-time was a neutral financial contingency that paid a flat $.13 at the end of the 3-m condition regardless of how many data entry screens were completed, either \"work alone\" or \"fix partner errors.\" Throughout all conditions, a text box showing the amount earned within that condition was always visible. When in a piece-rate condition and a \"work alone\" screen was processed correctly, the $.02 earned immediately updated the cumulative amount earned box and briefly highlighted the box yellow. After each condition, a feedback screen replaced the data entry screen. The feedback screen informed participants how many total screens were submitted correctly, how much money they earned in that condition, how many screens were processed \"working alone\" and how many screens were processed \"fixing partner errors.\"\nTo ensure participants attended to the statements in the [CD.sup.1][CE.sup.1][CD.sup.2][CE.sup.2] conditions, at the start of each new condition, a message box with the motivational statement would appear (e.g., \"cooperation is highly valued\") that the participant would have to click out of in order to begin that new session. After the message box was removed, that same motivational statement immediately began to scroll across the bottom of the screen until the participant made the choice to either \"work alone\" or \"fix partner errors.\" Once a participant made a selection, the statement was removed, and patient information appeared. The same motivational statement would reappear in a given 3-m condition once a screen was submitted and the participant was again asked to select the option to either work alone or fix partner errors. In the D and E conditions, the motivational statements were intended to increase cooperative or conformity responding (i.e., selecting the \"fix partner errors\" button) despite no compensation for doing so (i.e., piece rate financial contingency for working alone only). All possible motivational statements based on individual D-IRAP scores and the neutral statements are shown in Table 2.\nPostexperiment Questionnaire\nFollowing the Phase 2 EKG data entry task, participants completed a posttest questionnaire and were paid the money they earned in Phase 2. The posttest questionnaire asked participants whether the motivational statements effected their cooperative or conformity responding, what task was easier to complete (work alone or fix partner errors), and if not getting paid to fix partner errors had any effect on their cooperative and conformity responding. In addition, participants were asked if they believed their partner was real and if the presence of a partner had an effect on their responding (i.e., was there a self-generated or derived social contingency) and the overall satisfaction with the study. Lastly, participants were asked if they had previously heard about the study.",
        "analysis": "Eye-Tracking Analysis\nEye tracking was used as a secondary measure to determine if correlations existed between eye fixation count of our three AOIs (\"fix partner errors\" button, \"work alone\" button, and the scrolling message) and choice allocation (see Appendix for AOIs). In addition, correlations between the AOIs were analyzed for 18 of the participants so that their accuracy of recording with respect to eye gaze calibration was at a level that captured the AOIs consistently across each condition.\nFindings showed strong correlations for both the relationship between the eye fixation count of the fix partner errors button and fix partner errors choice, and also the correlation between eye fixation count of the work alone button and work alone choice (see Figure 6). Results of the Pearson correlation indicated that there was a significant positive association between the eye fixation count of the fix partner errors button and fix partner errors choice (r(17) =.633,p < .01) and a strong positive association between eye fixation count of the work alone button and work alone choice (r(17) = .69, p < .001). Said another way, there is a correlation between participants looking at a particular button and a participant selecting that button.\nAs mentioned, another correlation of interest was the association between the eye fixation of the scrolling message (the AOI that contained the neutral and motivational statements) and eye fixation of either the fix partner errors button or work alone button. Results of the Pearson correlation indicated there was a significant positive association between the eye fixation count of the scrolling message and the eye fixation count of the fix partner errors button (r(17) =.81, p < .0001). In other words, a relationship existed between participants looking at the scrolling message when it contained a cooperative or conformity motivational statement and looking at the fix partner errors button. When looking at the correlation between the scrolling message and work alone responding, results of the Pearson correlation indicated a significant negative association between eye fixation count of the scrolling message and work alone choice (r(17) = -.15,p< .001). Thus, a relationship existed between participants increasing independent responding (selecting the work alone button) and decreasing eye fixation on the scrolling message area of interest. These two findings strengthen the argument that when participants are fixating on the scrolling messages, they are coming under control of the motivational statements with respect to choosing to fix partner errors (i.e., cooperate or conform) or attending to the fix partner errors button. This positive correlation between looking at the scrolling message AOI and looking at the fix partner errors button, but not selecting it, also strengthens the argument that the motivational statements only temporarily, or initially, increased the reinforcing value of selecting the button to fix partner errors. Although participants saw the motivational statement to cooperate or conform and then attended to the fix partner errors button, they were ultimately not selecting to fix partner errors consistently across a 3-m condition.\nPostexperiment Questionnaire\nWhen asked, 85% of participants (n = 56) reported they primarily worked alone rather than fixed partner errors. Of those 56 participants, 56% (n = 29) said they did so as it was the \"easier\" choice and 37% (n = 19) said they did so because they got paid. However, when participants were asked explicitly what task was harder, working alone or fixing partner errors, responding was split fairly even, 35% (n = 23) reported working alone was more difficult, 38% (n = 25) reported fixing partner errors was more difficult and 27% (n = 18) reported no difference in difficulty. When asked if not getting paid to fix partner errors atfected their cooperative or conformity behavior, 50% of participants (n = 33) reported it decreased then-cooperative behavior. This would suggest the consequence of working alone (i.e., financial contingency to make money), rather than the task itself (i.e., easier to work alone) motivated participants to select to work alone more frequently. Further, when asked if they were motivated by money, 81 % (n = 55) of participants reported they were at least somewhat to highly motivated to earn money. All 67 participants indicated they noticed the motivational statements in the EKG data entry task and 45% (n = 31) reported that the motivational statements increased their cooperative or conformity responding. Lastly, when asked explicitly if the motivational statements increased cooperative or conformity responding, 59% (n = 39) said that it increased their level of fixing partner errors. This selfreporting is lower than the 76% (n = 51) identified in the data that differentially responded to the motivational statements (see EKG data entry results discussion). This could be that participants reported that the statements initially set the occasion to fix partner errors, but the financial contingency to work alone eventually dominated responding.",
        "results": "Results\nPhase 1: IRAP\nResponse latencies of the MD IRAP were calculated using the standard D-algorithm, which produces a D-IRAP score that is similar to Cohen's d effect size (Bames-Holmes et al., 2010a, b; Cohen, 1988). Individual D-IRAP scores were provided for all eight stimuli presented within the MD IRAP. D-IRAP scores were organized in terms of effect size using the Rafacz et al. (2019) classification system. A strong effect (< -.8 and >.8), medium effect (-.5 to -.8 or .5 to .8), small effect (-.21 to -.49 or .21 to .49) and neutral or no effect (-.2 to .2). The D-IRAP score indicates both the strength and direction (positive or negative) of the relational response to the stimulus. The two strongest positive stimuli from both the cooperative and conformity lists were identified for each participant and used in Phase 2 of the study for that particular participant.\nTable 3 shows the breakdown of each stimulus for the cooperative and conformity lists and the number of participants who exhibited a strong, medium, weak, and neutral effect. Based on Rafacz et al. (2019) and Smith (2013) classification system of the strength of D-IRAP scores, a participant was considered to have a moderate to strong history with a particular stimulus if their D-IRAP score was .5 or higher. Having two classes of stimuli (cooperation and conformity) in the MD IRAP allowed for a posthoc classification system of participants and a between group comparison based on the strength of D-IRAP scores for each list, cooperation and conformity (see Table 1 for list). For example, if a participant had a D-IRAP score of >.5 for their top two stimuli from either the cooperative or conformity list (i.e., their top two cooperative stimuli were both >.5) they were identified as \"pro-cooperative.\" Based on the identification of a D-IRAP score of greater than .5 indicating a strong to moderate relationship with a particular stimulus (Smith, 2013), we were able to identify four post-hoc groups: \"cooperative\" (i.e., their top two cooperative stimuli were >.5), \"conformity\" (i.e., their top two conformity stimuli were >.5), \"both\" (i.e., their top two cooperative and conformity stimuli were >.5) and \"neither\" (i.e., one or more stimuli from each group was <.5). This classification system allowed for a post-hoc analysis of between group responding after each participant had gone through Phase 2. See Table 4 for the average D-IRAP scores for each group.\nPhase 2: Data Entry Task\nThis study primarily examined the differential effects of varying stimuli (individually identified in the MD IRAP) on cooperative and conformity responding functioning as potential motivational stimuli, or motivative augmentals. In order to discuss these statements functioning as motivative augmentals, the order of choice allocation within each condition was analyzed. This study also assessed the potential delineation between the terms cooperation and conformity as predicted by the MD IRAP and demonstrated in the EKG data entry task. Identifying participants based on their IRAP scores as being part of a particular group: \"cooperative,\" \"conformity,\" \"both,\" and \"neither\" allowed for a between group analysis and a discussion related to the differential responding between each group and the relation to the definitions of cooperation and conformity that were provided. Lastly, the secondary measure of eye tracking and its correlation to participant choice behavior was analyzed.\nEffect of Statements on Cooperative/Conformity Responding\nThe effects of the statements on cooperative and conformity responding (choosing to fix partner errors; FPE) were determined through a visual depiction and statistical analysis at the individual level for each participant and also determined through statistical analysis at the group level. Fifty-one of the 67 participants (76%) increased cooperative or conformity responding with respect to experimental conditions that included a motivational statement (conditions D and E). The statements can be argued to have functioned as motivative augmentals for the majority of participants as the data demonstrated the reinforcing function of cooperating or conforming, as selecting the fix partner errors button temporarily increased in the presence of the statements at a descriptive level (see Figure 2). Or, as Hayes (1989) puts it, \"the statement of the rule might establish certain stimuli as more effective behavioral consequences; that is, the statement of the rule might make those stimuli more rewarding or more aversive\" (p. 291). In order to further substantiate that these stimuli temporarily altered the reinforcing function of selecting to fix partner errors, and thus functioned as motivative augmentals, a statistical analysis of variance was run to power. Results of a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures indicated there was a statistically significant difference in choosing to fix partner errors (i.e., cooperative or conformity responding) between conditions with a motivational statement and conditions with a neutral statement F (7, 462) = 23.23, p = <.00001, [n.sup.2] = .26. Based on the descriptive and statistical analyses, the verbal statements functioned as establishing operations that temporarily increased the reinforcing function of fixing partner errors as they participated in a relational frame of equivalence with the existing categories of reinforcing stimuli, cooperation or conformity, as identified in the MD IRAP.\nTemporary Alteration of Choice Behavior\nAdding to the argument that the motivational statements functioned as motivative augmentals, an analysis of the temporary alteration of the reinforcing effects to choose to fix partner errors in the presence of motivational statements was necessary. Previous research (Candido, 2013) discussed the momentary, or temporary, function of motivative augmentals, in particular in conditions that included a competing directacting contingency. Measuring the order of choice allocation across each 3-m condition captured the momentary transformation of stimulus function to choose to fix partner errors as the more reinforcing alternative in the presence of motivational statements (see Figure 3.)\nOn average, a total of 18.3 screens were processed in each 3-m condition, whether that was a selection to fix partner errors or work alone. When presented with a motivational statement to cooperate or conform at the start of each condition, participants initially--or temporarily--chose to fix partner errors as their reinforcement history predicted, rather than choose the direct acting financial contingency to work independently and make money. Visual depiction of the data (Figure 3) suggests the majority of participants chose to fix partner errors within their first three choices in each condition with a motivational statement more so than in conditions with either no statement or conditions with a neutral statement. In addition, a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures on fixing partner errors demonstrated there was a statistically significant difference in fixing partner errors (i.e., cooperative or conformity responding) within the first three responses between conditions with a motivational statement as compared to conditions with a neutral statement F(7, 441) = 21.21, p <.00001, [n.sup.2] = .25. When comparing the percentage of participants who chose to fix partner errors within their first three choices in each condition with a motivational statement (see Figure 3) to the overall percentage of choosing to fix partner errors for the entirety of each 3-m condition (see Figure 2), participants had higher percentages of fixing partner errors within the first three choices as compared to the entirety of the condition wherein the independent response (work alone) dominated. By comparing the average percent of cooperative or conformity responding across each 3-m condition with a motivational statement to the average percent of cooperative or conformity responding within the first three choices, the percentage of responses to fix partner errors declined, which pointed to the temporary alteration of responding.\nBetween Group Comparison\nA visual depiction of the data broken out by group across experimental conditions showed there was a differentiation between groups with respect to experimental conditions with a motivational statement and cooperative or conformity responding. The \"both\" and \"cooperative\" groups on average fixed partner errors in experimental conditions with a motivational statement more so than both the \"conformity\" group and the \"neither\" group. In addition, the average of fixing partner errors in all four motivational statement conditions between groups differed (see Table 5). Based on the difference across groups, as well as our overall visual analysis (see Figure 4), posthoc paired-samples t-tests were conducted to confirm conclusions from the visual analysis. Results showed that the \"both\" group (M= .46, SD = .36) fixed partner errors significantly more than the \"neither\" group (M = .24, SD = .33), t = 3.36,p < .001, d = .64 and the \"conformity\" group (M= .26, SD = .31), t = 2.91, p < .01, d = .59. Additional paired-sampled /-tests showed that the \"cooperative\" group (M = .4, SD = .34) also fixed partner errors significantly more than the \"neither\" group (M- .24, SD = .33), t = -2.94,p < .01, d= .48 and the \"conformity\" group (M = .26, SD = .31), t = 2.34,p < .05, d = .43. Based on this analysis, the \"both\" and \"cooperative\" groups fixed partner errors in experimental conditions with motivational statements statistically higher than both the \"conformity\" and \"neither\" group. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences when comparing the \"conformity\" group to the \"neither\" group or comparing the \"both\" group to the \"cooperative\" group.\nAlthough there was no statistical difference in responding between the \"both\" group and the \"cooperative\" group when comparing the average of cooperative or conformity responding across all four conditions with a motivational statement, a visual analysis of the data showed a maintenance of responding with respect to fixing partner errors with the \"both\" group that was absent in all other groups (see Figure 5). When comparing the first motivational statement condition ([D.sup.1]) and the last motivational statement condition ([E.sup.2]), results showed a decline in selecting to fix partner errors (cooperative or conformity responding) in the \"cooperative,\" \"conformity,\" and \"neither\" group in subsequent conditions. Post-hoc paired t-tests confirmed the \"cooperative\" group fixed partner errors significantly more in the first condition with a motivational statement (M = .63, SD = .31) than compared to the fourth motivational statement (M= .26, SD = .32), t = 3.61, p < .001, d = 1.17, the \"conformity\" group fixed partner errors significantly more in the first condition with a motivational statement (M = .47, SD = .35) compared to the fourth motivational statement (M= . 16, SD = .27), t= 2.91, p; < .01, d = .99, and the \"neither\" group fixed partner errors significantly more in the first condition with a motivational statement (M = .4, SD = .38) compared to the fourth motivational statement (M= .19, SD = .29), t = 2.02,p < .05, d = .6. The \"both\" group, however, had no change in responding at a statistically significant level when comparing rates of cooperative or conformity responding (fixing partner errors) across conditions, showing a maintenance of cooperative or conformity responding in the presence of motivational statements and a financially competing contingency to work alone.",
        "limitations": "",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThis extended research examining varying financial contingencies, and level of customization of motivational statements (rules) on cooperative and conformity responding. Previous research looking at various financial contingencies and cooperative responding showed that most participants do not alter cooperative responding in financially competing contingencies even when presented with motivational statements to cooperatively respond (Candido, 2013; Maglieri, 2007; Rafacz et al., 2019). Rather, participants will only cooperate under financially neutral contingencies (i.e., pay for time or profit share). However, in this study, the stimuli used in the motivational statements in the EKG data entry task were taken from each participant's MD IRAP results and were individualized. This is a level of customization that was missing from previous studies that instead aggregated IRAP results at the group level and embedded those stimuli into the EKG data entry task (Candido, 2013; Maglieri, 2007; Rafacz et al., 2019). Therefore, it was predicted based on these previous studies, that individually determined motivational statements would yield the most cooperative or conformity responding. In individualizing the motivational statements, we found that the majority (76%) of participants responded to the motivational statements by choosing to fix partner errors at a level that was higher than the ABA conditions and the neutral statement conditions, at least initially, in each condition with a motivational statement.\nAlso consistent with previous research was the impact on cooperative and conformity responding when presented with a financially competing contingency. Research has shown that participants will primarily respond in accordance with whatever direct financial contingency is in place (Candido, 2013; Maglieri, 2007; Rafacz et al., 2019). In this study, when participants were under a piece-rate financial contingency to promote individual responding, cooperative and conformity responding was temporary and individual responding dominated. Previous research (Candido, 2013; Rafacz et al., 2019) also looked at varying a financially neutral contingency (i.e., payment is the same for either choice) and a competing piece rate contingency to see the differences in responding with respect to motivational statements. As mentioned, participants chose to fix partner errors more frequently when in conditions with financially neutral contingencies rather than competing financial contingencies. This study only examined conditions with financially competing contingencies and found that, like previous research, the motivational statements only temporarily altered cooperative and conformity responding, rather than replacing the contingency-shaped responding (Candido, 2013; Maglieri, 2007; Rafacz et al., 2019). When crafting messaging for any audience, therefore, it is predicted that the rule (i.e., antecedent stimulus) and the direct-acting contingency should align in order to promote and maintain a specific behavior. This study was designed as an analog to highlight the effect of motivational statements on cooperative or conformity responding even in the face of losing money to do so. As with any analog study taking place in a laboratory, there are limitations to directly generalizing results to what would occur in a field environment. Of course, field locations have many variables that cannot be controlled, and the setting or organization may not allow the time for phase changes. Productivity cannot be compromised, and employee participation may not be optimal for research in an actual work setting. The lack of controls for a study in a field environment necessitates the need for an analog study. By neutralizing the effect of some of the controlling variables in the work environment and running the study in the laboratory, the researchers were able to determine the effect of some fewer number but isolated dependent variables. What the researchers compromised was the extent to which the work setting is successfully duplicated to accurately collect generalizable work-setting data. Whether or not this analog study correlated directly to an organization's naturalistic working environment, some empirical information can be indicated with this approach and offers incremental improvements in terms of demonstrating the motivational influence of communication (organizational rules as well as the source of rule generation) on cooperative responding. The information attained may be useful for future research in this field.\nExperimental research looking into motivative augmentals is extremely limited (Kissi et al., 2017). In order to approach an experimental and functional account, future work could attempt to establish motivative augmentals using arbitrary words for the purpose of \"developing a functional-analytic precision of rule-following based on a laboratory induced network of derived relations\" (Kissi et al., 2017, p. 15). The limited research available could be due to the fact that motivative augmentals are said to augment the other classes of rule-governed behavior, pliance and tracking (Hayes, 1989). Plys and tracks are subject to alteration based on augmentals as they alter the reinforcing consequences of either plys or tracks by \"creating a need\" (Hayes, 1989, p. 208). This study was an attempt at an experimental analysis of motivative augmentals \"creating that need\" with respect to cooperative or conformity responding.\nUnderstanding the conditions under which a person will engage in cooperative or conformity behavior even in the presence of a competing contingency and crafting messaging to function as motivative augmentals has implications at the organizational and cultural level. Based on previous studies (Maglieri, 2007; Rafacz et al., 2019), the alteration of responding is temporary in the face of a financially competing contingency. Therefore, we should predict that crafting communication to promote a particular behavior under similar financial circumstances will to not maintain that particular behavior over time. However, with this study, we identified a group (\"both\" group) wherein responding was likely to be sustained at higher levels even with a financially competing contingency. This maintenance of responding could be that participants that relationally responded at statistically significant levels to both cooperative and conformity stimuli based on the MDIRAP results have a history of helping others with respect to some shared outcome (i.e., helping to fix a partners errors as they would do for you, cooperative/reciprocal responding) and a history of socially mediated rule following (conformity responding). Similar to Tomeke et al.'s (2008) discussion on the problems with generalized tracking, being a \"cooperative\" person is based on a personal history of derived relations among events which transforms the function of ineffective rules. This leads a participant to being inflexible to the actual short-term consequence of cooperative responding (losing money) and rigid rule following with respect to behaving as they \"ought to\" based on listener-generated rules and the socially mediated consequences related to being cooperative. In other words, those that fell within this group were insensitive to the direct financial contingency and engaged in generalized pliance where the consequence of choosing to \"fix partner errors\" was controlled by some abstract, verbally constructed consequence. In either case, maintenance of responding across conditions with the \"both\" group may not have been appropriately contextually controlled as those that fall within this group were responding to delayed and arbitrarily derived social contingencies that dominated immediate consequences. Assessment tools like the MD IRAP may help organizations and those in leadership positions to identify those employees, citizens, etc. who have a history of reinforcement with respect to an arbitrary relation between the social consequence of following rules (conforming) and being a cooperative person as their behavior is more likely to be maintained (O'Conner et al., 2019; Tomeke et al., 2008). And by augmenting this particular repertoire, an individual, \"may pursue more and more remote and probabilistic consequences which will alter the reinforcing and punishing properties of present contingencies\" (Tomeke et al., 2008, p. 155).\nFuture research could look at the other classes of rulegoverned behavior (plys and tracks) and the impact motivative augmentals have on rules by analyzing particular patterns of responding, like this study found across specific groups. As discussed above, the \"both\" group maintained their cooperative and conformity responding when presented with a motivational statement (rule) more so than the other identified groups. Based on generalized tracking (Tomeke et al, 2008) and our definition of conformity and the social consequences of rule following, a participant maintains conformity and cooperative responding when presented with a motivational statement (rule) as there is correspondence between the current rule (e.g., cooperation is highly valued) and other rules in the listener's history (e.g., \"I am a cooperative person\"). In the case of the \"cooperative\" group, data demonstrated more flexible mle following across conditions. When initially presented with a motivational statement to cooperate in condition D1, the \"cooperative\" group fixed partner errors at a rate that was higher than all other groups but then quickly decelerated in subsequent conditions (see Figure 5). Based on these patterns of responding, the motivational statements can be argued to have augmented pliance influenced by socially mediated factors (e.g., doing what someone tells you to do, in this case to be cooperative and fix partner errors). However, once participants came into contact with the direct consequences of a cooperative or conformity response (i.e., fixing partner errors and not making money), responding switched over to working alone and making money. This is an example of rule-governed behavior appropriately transferring from instances of socially mediated consequences (pliance) to the ones aligned with the way the world is arranged (see tracking, Hayes, 1989). Likewise, the \"neither\" group demonstrated a motivative augmental effect initially in conditions when presented with a motivational statement, although at much lower rates than any other group. In addition, responding switched over to working alone at higher rates (see Figures 3 and 4). The \"neither\" group shows more flexible rule following (transitioning from pliance to tracking) within each condition with a motivational statement that was similar to the \"cooperative\" group, but at lower rates of responding to fix partner errors with the initial presentation of a motivational statement (see Figure 5). This would be predicted as participants who were categorized as being part of the \"neither\" group had the lowest overall DIRAP scores for both the cooperative and conformity stimuli (see Table 4). Lastly, the \"conformity\" group, based on our definition of conformity, may have had lower levels of cooperative and conformity responding as any rules related to being part of a group and the socially mediated consequences of following a particular rule (pliance) may not have been in a frame of coordination of being \"cooperative.\" In addition, the group to which the person would conform was contrived. Correspondence between behavior and rules about what is \"right\" are based on a history of arbitrary socially mediated consequences that may have nothing to do with making a cooperative response.\nThe opportunity to measure eye fixation allowed us to do several analyses. The simplest, but still important, was to confirm that participants actually attended to the motivational statements. In addition, our correlational analyses between eye fixations on the motivational statements and eye fixations on choice buttons and choice behavior were significant. These findings further the argument that the motivational statements functioned as motivative augmentals as the data demonstrated the correlation between participant's looking at a particular motivational statement and attending to the \"fix partner errors\" button, regardless of the specific choice behavior. The eye-tracking correlation also helped to confirm the momentary influence of motivational statements on responding. Motivative augmentals temporarily alter the reinforcing consequences of a particular behavior. The correlation between participant's attending to the motivational statement (i.e., eye gaze frequency) and then immediately looking at the fix partner error button demonstrates what we may refer to as a brief and immediate relational response (BIRRs). However, the data suggested that although participants immediately attended to the motivational statement and then to the fix partner error button (i.e., BIRRs), participants ultimately altered their responding and chose to instead work alone. This alteration of responding may be referred to as an extended and elaborated relational response (EERRs; Bames-Holmes et al., 2010a, b).\nPrevious studies (Maglieri, 2007; Rafacz et ah, 2019) cited that peer introduction was a limitation. In this study, peers were not used, but implied in the EKG data entry script. In Rafacz et al. (2019), the majority of participants reported in the postexperiment questionnaire that they did not believe their partner was real. Based on this feedback, Candido (2013) introduced peers (confederates) as a variable to the experiment and found that the majority of participants still did not believe their partner was real. Our postexperiment questionnaire reflected the same limitation. Seventy-six percent of participants reported that they did not believe their partner was real. Given this and previous feedback, the EKG data entry task may be limited as it does not provide the necessary feedback in order for a participant to assume there is a partner present. The EKG data entry task also does not provide a commensurate consequence between the participant and the \"partner\" that is considered necessary for many definitions of cooperation (Guerin, 1994; Hake & Vukelich, 1972; Schmitt, 1984). Future extensions of this task may look to include feedback on the screen that shows your partner's performance and the reciprocal relationship between the performance of the participant and partner. In addition, the preexperiment survey (Table 1) was intended to identify the stimuli to be used in the MD IRAP that was most similar to \"working with others\" for the cooperation stimuli and \"conforming with others\" for the conformity stimuli. However, this study did not include the stimulus, \"conformity\" in the list of stimuli most similar to \"conforming with others.\" This may have had an effect on the rank order of the terms best suited for the phrase \"conforming with others\" as it is assumed the stimulus \"conformity\" would have ranked in the top four stimuli and therefore would have had an effect on those participants who would be identified as \"pro-conformity\" based on IRAP performance. Future studies could look to include the stimulus, \"conformity\" into the class of stimuli used for the conformity list and if this has an effect on the number of participants identified as part of the \"conformity\" group. Lastly, our between group analysis was not balanced. Based on our MD IRAP classification of data, we identified 9 \"both\" participants, 22 \"neither\" participants, 19 \"cooperative\" participants, and 17 \"conformity\" participants. This limited the statistical analyses that were implemented and did not permit for a mixed ANOVA analysis to be run to power.\nBased on the results of this study and the differential responding between the cooperative and conformity stimuli and the potential to differentiate IRAP groups, we may begin to make the case of the potential functional delineation between cooperation and conformity. Analyzing the existing literature and experimental research in the social psychological field of the two terms allows for a more rigorous behavior analytic understanding and distinction of the phenomena and their ability to function as motivative augmentals. As Kissi et al. (2017) say, \"it is likely that work in other areas of psychology (e.g., experiments on obedience to authority; see Blass, 1999, and Milgram, 1963) exists that may be of relevance to our understanding of the behaviors associated with pliance, tracking, and augmenting\" (p. 17). It is important as behavior scientists to understand the terms cooperation and conformity and the distinction between the two as it may have important implications in social settings and sociocultural phenomena. It is possible that we are not considering apparent direct social contingencies or a lack of a shared outcome, leading to an overgeneralization of the term cooperation. As behavior scientists work to better understand the conditions under which people are likely to conform and cooperate and the distinctions between the two, we are able to promote instances in which their application is for prosocial behaviors. Arranging the environment to encourage instances of conformity or cooperative behavior and the consequences of increasing such prosocial behaviors impacts us all when it is applied to any number of important areas like organizational settings, social justice movements, and political participation.\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\nConflict of Interest On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest.\nEthical Approval All procedures performed in this study involving human participants were in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments.\nInformed Consent Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in this study.\nData Availability The datasets during and/or analyzed during this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nAppendix\nCaption: Fig. 7 Modified TRAP screen\nCaption: Fig. 8 EKG data entry screens\nCaption: Fig. 9 EKG data entry screen with patient information\nCaption: Fig. 10 EKG data entry screen with AOIs highlighted\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/S40732-020-00400-7",

        "introduction": "Building on the work of Heerdink et al. (2013), this research assessed the relationship between group reactions and conformity, with feelings of acceptance/rejection proposed to mediate and the need for affiliation to moderate the effect. The direct relationship between the need for affiliation and conformity was also examined. There was a direct relationship between group reactions and cognitive conformity. Furthermore, there was a relationship between group reactions and feelings of acceptance/rejection and between acceptance/rejection and affective and behavioural conformity. Full mediation of acceptance/rejection was not present between group reaction and cognitive conformity. Finally, there was a partial effect for need for affiliation on conformity; however, the moderating effect of need for affiliation was inconsistent.\nKeywords: conformity, need for affiliation, group reactions, acceptance/rejection\nImagine as vividly as possible that you and several friends decide to go on a vacation together. After some discussion, the group decides to go to a ski resort. Once realising how expensive flights are, you propose to change plans and take a road trip to the next city. Your friends respond as if they are disappointed, even angry. Take a moment to try to picture everything in your 'mind's eye'. Imagine how you might feel in the situation. Does this negative emotional response lead you to conform to the group, or do you leave the group?\nConformity is a rational process, where individuals construct a norm based on other people's behaviour to determine what is appropriate or right for themselves (Asch, 1952). Conformity occurs when the pressure for uniformity influences individuals to change their behaviours, opinions, or perceptions to become closer to the group norm (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004). Although the literature on the decision-making processes involved in conformity is vast, comparatively little is known about emotional and motivational influences on those processes. The present study, therefore, aims to contribute to our understanding of this area by looking at the effects of group reactions and feelings of acceptance and rejection on conformity, as well as whether the need for affiliation moderates the relationship between group reactions and feelings of acceptance/rejection.\nEmotions in Groups\nIn recent years there has been an increasing awareness of emotions having interpersonal consequences and functions (Cote, 2005; Elfenbein, 2007; Fischer & Manstead, 2008; Hareli & Rafaeli, 2008; Lazarus, 1991; van Kleef, 2009). Emotions expressed by groups or individuals may influence the behaviours, emotions, and thoughts of other groups and individuals through inferential or affective processes (e.g., liking or emotional contagion; Hess & Bourgeois, 2010; van Kleef, 2009; van Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2010; see also Molden, Lucas, Gardner, Dean, & Knowles, 2009). Regarding inferential processes, observers often infer information about people's attitudes, feelings, behavioural intentions, and relational orientation based on their emotional expressions (DeWall, 2010; Keltner & Haidt, 1999). For instance, sadness becomes apparent when an individual experiences irrevocable loss and has little coping potential (Smith, Haynes, Lazarus, & Pope, 1993). Therefore, observers of sadness may infer that the expresser is in need of support, which may lead the observer to offer support (Clarke, Pataki, & Carver, 1996). In addition, when a person is the focus of an angry expression, they may infer that they are to blame and did something wrong, which in turn may inform behaviour (van Kleef, 2009).\nEvidence suggests that expressions of emotions can also have an interpersonal influence by provoking affective reactions in observers, and therefore affect their behaviour (Chow, Tiedens, & Goven, 2008; van Kleef, 2009). Emotions can transmit directly to the observer from the expresser by emotional-contagion processes that involve afferent feedback (i.e., physiological feedback from either facial, postural or vocal shifts), imitation, and mirror-neuron activity (van Kleef, 2009). On the other hand, emotional expressions can also affect interpersonal liking and impressions (van Kleef, 2009). One study found that working teams with an angry manager also became angry themselves and acquired a negative impression of the manager, while teams with a happy manager became happy and developed a positive impression of the manager (Sy, Cote, & Saavedra, 2005). Additional studies found that negotiators whose colleagues expressed anger became angry themselves, disliked the colleague and were less willing to meet again. However, people whose colleague expressed happiness became happy and liked the other, and were more satisfied and willing to meet again (van Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2004; van Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2004b).\nHeerdink, van Kleef, Homan, and Fischer (2013) conducted a series of five studies on social influence and emotions in groups, including the interpersonal effects of emotions in relation to conformity and deviance. In this series of studies, the authors investigated the relationship between majority emotions and feelings of acceptance and rejection by a deviant group member. In one study, Heerdink et al. (2013) used a vignette approach to examine the idea that emotional expressions are indicators of an individual's inclusionary status. Participants imagined themselves in a group where the majority reacted with anger, disappointment, happiness or no emotion to their deviant opinion. Results indicated that in a situation where a person disagrees with the majority, participants felt more rejected if the group expressed anger. However, deviant group members felt more accepted if the group exhibited happiness.\nIn another study, Heerdink et al. (2013) explored situations in which the majority's emotions can pressure deviant group members to conform by prompting feelings of acceptance and rejection. The role of perceived cooperativeness was investigated by asking participants to recall a situation where their opinion had differed from those of the group and to report the emotions that were expressed by the majority. Following this, participants were asked to what extent they felt pressure to conform to the situation. Heerdink et al. (2013) preferred this method compared to asking participants whether they actually conformed, given that individuals are generally disinclined to overtly disclose their conformity. Interestingly, evidence suggests that individuals distort their memories of acting with conformity to make it look as if they initially agreed (Griffin & Buehler, 1993). Heerdink et al. (2013) also examined whether the effects of the majority emotions on conformity pressure were facilitated by perceived rejection. The results of this study replicated the finding that the majority's emotions are related to the extent to which individuals feel accepted or rejected. In addition, this study indicated that in situations that were perceived as cooperative, higher conformity pressure was experienced to the extent that less happiness and more anger was expressed, and this correlation was mediated by feelings of rejection. In situations that were perceived as competitive, a similar mediating effect was not found, which is consistent with the idea that conformity is not a meaningful way of showing good group membership in a competitive setting (Heerdink et al., 2013).\nAlthough the aforementioned evidence suggests that emotions influence conformity in interpersonal relationships, individual differences in the motivations to conform should also be considered. One significant issue that Heerdink et al. (2013) suggest require future research is the idea of teasing apart the motivational processes that may underlie the behavioural conformity effect observed. As participants adapted their behaviour because they felt rejected, Heerdink et al. (2013) note the possibility that their participants were driven by a desire to affiliate.\nNeed for Affiliation as a Moderator of Conformity\nTo extend from the study conducted by Heerdink et al. (2013), the present study examined the moderating role of need for affiliation (Leary, 2010). The need for affiliation is powerful and pervasive, and it motivates the way in which individuals form positive and lasting interpersonal relationships (Leary, 2010; Steinal et al., 2010). As early as 1967, McGhee and Teevan argued that a high desire for affiliation to referent groups may be associated with greater conformity; however, this relationship has seldom been clearly demonstrated. Rose, Shoham, Kahle, and Batra (1994) found that socially oriented people exhibited a greater need for affiliation, which was consistent with the empirical findings of Homer and Kahle (1988) and Rotter (1966). Furthermore, Rose et al. (1994) found that people with a high need for group affiliation tend to conform more and that conformity and high group identification were positively related. Rose et al. reasoned that people with strong group identification may be more reliant on others and are therefore more likely to conform to gain approval. In contrast to these findings, numerous other studies found no significant relationship between need for affiliation and conformity (Crutchfield, 1955; Samelson, 1957). These inconsistencies in past literature make it problematic to draw conclusions as to whether or not there is, in fact, a relationship between need for affiliation and one's desire to conform.\nThe Current Study: Aims and Hypotheses\nAlthough the effects of conformity in group behaviour are clearly important to understand, the brief review above indicates that there are a number of outstanding and unresolved issues. The aim of the present research is to add to our current understanding of the emotional and motivational processes involved in conformity, and to contribute to the resolution of some of the conflicting findings that have been noted. Our approach was to begin by partially replicating the study by Heerdink et al. (2013) to determine whether there was an effect of group reactions on conformity. We first wanted confirm the relationship between group reactions and acceptance/rejection. It was hypothesised that participants would feel more accepted if the group responds with happiness, whereas individuals would feel rejected if the group responds with either negative or neutral emotion.\nNext, we were interested in determining if the relationship between group reactions and conformity is mediated by feelings of acceptance and rejection. We hypothesised that the relationship between group reactions and conformity would be mediated by feelings of acceptance and rejection. We hypothesised that participants who felt greater rejection would feel more pressure to conform compared to those who felt accepted in an effort to regain standing in the group. Furthermore, we sought to explore whether the need for affiliation moderated the relationship between group reactions and feelings of acceptance and rejection. It was hypothesised that need for affiliation will moderate the effect of group reactions on feelings of acceptance/rejection, with those participants reporting a high (versus low) need for affiliation feeling greater pressure to conform after experiencing rejection.\nFinally, we wanted to assess whether there was a direct relationship between the need for affiliation and conformity. As mentioned, several studies (e.g., Hardy, 1957; McGhee & Teevan, 1967; Rose et al., 1994; Schacter, 1951) have found that conformity is positively correlated with a high need for affiliation, whereas other studies have found no significant relationship (Crutchfield, 1955; Samelson, 1957). Therefore, the relationship between need for affiliation requires clarification.",
        "methodology": "Methods\nDesign\nThe design of this study was partially based on the research of Heerdink et al. (2013). We first looked at the effect of group reactions on conformity. Group reaction had four conditions (i.e., anger, happiness, disappointment, and neutral). Feelings of acceptance and rejection were proposed to mediate the relationship between group reaction and conformity. Conformity was evaluated using three separate measures: affective (feelings of pressure), cognitive (abiding by the majority), and behavioural (leaving the group). Need for affiliation was proposed to moderate the effect of group reactions on feelings of acceptance and rejection. Finally, a test was conducted to address the inconsistencies regarding the relationship between need for affiliation and conformity (see Figure 1 for an illustration for the proposed relationships among the variables).\nParticipants\nA total of 216 undergraduate participants from a New Zealand university took part in this study, and 181 of the 216 questionnaires were fully completed and were able to be used for analysis. Out of the 181 participants, 163 identified as women and 17 as males. One participant preferred not to say. The sample consisted of 128 who identified as New Zealand/ European, 17 as Maori, 1 as Samoan, 3 as Cook Islander Maori, 3 as Tongan, 1 identified as Chinese, 2 as Indian, and 26 identified as other. The average age of participants was 27.63 (SD = 10.86). The minimum age of participants was 17 and the maximum was 68.\nMaterials and Procedure\nThis study consisted of an online questionnaire, and employed materials similar to those used by Heerdink et al. (2013) including a similar vignette, acceptance/ rejection scale, a question on conforming versus leaving the group, and a question on conformity pressure. In addition, the Interpersonal Orientation Scale (IOS; Hill, 1987) was administrated. A manipulation check was included at the end of the questionnaire before the demographic items. Demographic items queried participants' gender, ethnicity, and age.\nParticipants were first asked to read a vignette that described a group situation in which the group's emotional response was manipulated (Heerdink et al., 2013). In the vignette, participants were asked to try to imagine as vividly as possible the situation described, imagining that they are in the scenario and how might they feel in the situation. The participant and three close friends had an issue with another friend and had come together to discuss and decide what they should do. All three friends shared the similar ideas, whereas the participant had a conflicting idea. The vignette ended with 'when it is your turn to tell your friends your idea, they don't immediately agree with you.....' followed by 'they then stared blankly with no sign of emotion whatsoever' (neutral/ no emotion condition), 'they then looked toward the ground, shaking their heads, clearly disappointed' (disappointment condition), 'they then smile and nod, clearly happy' (happy condition), or 'then they frowned, looking clearly angry' (anger condition). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four emotional conditions mentioned above, two of which were negative emotions (i.e., anger and disappointment).\nThe acceptance/rejection scale (Heerdink et al., 2013) measured the extent to which participants felt accepted versus rejected. The scale consists of four items; 'I feel rejected due to the group's reaction,' 'the group's reaction makes me feel alone,' 'the group's reaction makes me feel happy,' and 'I feel supported due to the group's reaction'. The latter two items are reverse coded. The items are scored on a 4-point scale (1= strongly disagree, 2= disagree, 3= agree, and 4= strongly agree). Higher scores on the acceptance/rejection scale indicate greater feelings of rejection. For the current study, the acceptance/rejection scale showed an overall Cronbach's alpha of [alpha] = .84, which indicates excellent internal consistency.\nThe three conformity items were all measured using a 7-point scale (Heerdink et al., 2013). The cognitive conformity item asked participants to indicate the extent to which they would 'conform to the group, while disregarding your own thought or idea (abide my majority)' and the item regarding leaving the group (behavioural conformity) asked participants whether they would 'attempt to find other friends whose reasoning is similar to your own'. Options ranged from 'definitely not conform to the group' to 'definitely conform to the group'. For the affective conformity question, participants were asked to 'please indicate to what extent you felt pressure to be in agreement with the group', and responses ranged from 'absolutely no pressure' to 'an extreme amount of pressure'.\nThe IOS (Hill, 1987) was developed to focus on four aspects assumed to correlate with affiliation motivation: positive stimulation, attention, emotional support, and social comparison. The positive stimulation subscale (9 items; a = .85) reflects social reward; an example item is 'I get satisfaction out of contact with others more than most people realise'. The attention component (6 items; a = .84) reflects the social motive of attention seeking; an example is 'I like to be around people when I can be center of attention'. Emotional support (6 items; a = .89) reflects the capacity for affiliation to decrease the experience of negative emotions related to fear-provoking or stressful situations. A sample item is 'If I feel unhappy or kind of depressed, I usually try to be around other people to make me feel better'. Finally, the social comparison dimension (5 items; [alpha] = .73) includes seeking information about self-relevant issues when objective criteria for evaluation are not available. An example is 'I find that I often look to certain other people to see how I compare to others'. Each item was assessed on a 4-point scale ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree'.\nFinally, to check whether participants perceived the intended emotional response, at the end of the questionnaire participants were asked to indicate which emotion was present in their scenario: A) Happiness, B) Anger, C) Disappointment, or D) Neural (no emotion).\nThe questionnaire was approximately 15 minutes long. As a Koha or offer of reciprocity, participants who fully completed the questionnaire were eligible to enter the draw to win a $100 gift voucher.",
        "analysis": "",
        "results": "Results\nManipulation Check\nA chi-square test of independence was used to determine whether the manipulation of the group's reaction had been successfully perceived by participants. The manipulation check indicated that what people perceived the group reaction to be was significantly different from what was expected, x(N = 181) = 24.34, p < .01 (refer to Table 1). Each of the four conditions had roughly the same number of participants. Interestingly, participants in the angry condition were more likely to have observed disappointment. Participants in the happy condition were more likely to have equally perceived both disappointment and neutral emotion. Participants in the disappointment condition observed the portrayed emotion correctly for the most part. Furthermore, participants in the neutral condition often observed disappointment. Nevertheless, given that the other measures may detect effects of the manipulation to which our check was not sensitive, we continued with the remainder of the analyses.\nGroup Reactions on Conformity Affective conformity\nA one-way between groups analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to explore the of impact of groups reactions on feelings of conformity pressure. There was no significant effect (F(3, 177) = 0.27, p = .85, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .01; see Table 2), as each of the conditions' means are approximately the same.\nCognitive conformity\nA one-way between groups ANOVA was conducted to explore the impact of group reactions on cognitive conformity. There was a significance difference (F(3, 177) = 5.48, p = .001, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .09) for participants abiding by the majority. Post-hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated that the difference was between the happy condition and each of the others (ps =< .03). All other comparisons were non-significant, ps >.85. The significant effect can also be seen in Table 2. Individuals in the happy condition tended to disregard their opinion less compared to each of the additional conditions.\nBehavioural conformity\nIn relation to behavioural conformity, a one-way ANOVA was conducted to examine whether there was an impact of group reactions on behavioural conformity. There was no significant effect on participants intentions to leave the group, F(3, 177) = 0.46, p = .71, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .01.\nIn sum, the present study concluded that group reactions did not affect feelings of pressure or intentions of leaving the group. However, there was a cognitive change; individuals in the happy condition tended to disregard their opinion less compared to each of the additional conditions. We therefore used Baron and Kenny's (1986) procedure to assess whether acceptance/rejection mediates the effect of group reaction on cognitive conformity.\nGroup Reactions on Acceptance/Rejection\nTo test whether there was a relationship between group reactions and feelings of acceptance/rejection, a one-way between groups ANOVA was conducted. Group reactions did have a significant effect on participants' feelings of acceptance and rejection, F(3, 177) = 13.55, p < .001, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .19.\nThe significant difference was again found in the happy condition (see Table 3). Post hoc Tukey HSD comparisons demonstrated that participants in the happy condition scored lower on rejection than those in the other conditions (ps < .001), and differences between each of the other conditions were nonsignificant (ps > .92).\nAcceptance/Rejection Mediating the Effect Between Group Reactions and Cognitive Conformity\nA general linear model with a categorical variable (i.e., group reaction) and a continuous moderator1 (i.e., acceptance/ rejection) was used to evaluate the third step of Baron and Kenny's (1986) procedure, which was to determine whether feelings of acceptance/rejection mediated the effect of group reactions on cognitive conformity (i.e., disregarding one's opinion in favour of the group).\nA marginally nonsignificant effect was found for feelings of acceptance/rejection (F(1, 176) = 3.66, p = .06, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .02) on cognitive conformity. The effect for group reaction was still present, (F(3, 176) = 6.78, p<.001, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .10), which indicates full mediation is not applicable.\nAcceptance/rejection on affective conformity. Despite the fact that mediation of acceptance/rejection was not present between group reactions and both affective and behavioural conformity, we were still interested in examining whether feelings of acceptance/rejection predict the additional two conformity measures.\nSimple regression was used to examine if feelings of acceptance/rejection predict whether individuals felt pressure to conform to the group. Results indicate that there was a relationship between feelings of acceptance/rejection and pressure to conform, b = 1.14, t(179) = 5.92, p < .001, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .16. The effect size for acceptance/rejection influencing conformity is large and in the positive direction. This illustrates that as feelings of rejection increase so does conformity pressure.\nAcceptance/rejection on behavioural conformity\nSimple regression was used to examine if acceptance/ rejection predicts intentions to leave the group.\nResults indicated a small, negative effect on intentions to leave the group, b = -.59, t(179) = -2.56, p = .01, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .04. As rejection increased, intentions of leaving the group declined.\nIOS Moderating the Effect Between Group Reactions and Acceptance/Rejection\nIOS general. A series of general linear models with the IOS scales included individually as a continuous variables were used to explore if IOS general and its subscales moderated the effect of group reaction on feelings of acceptance/rejection.\nResults indicate that IOS as a whole did moderate the effect of group reactions, F(1, 171) = 3.40, p = .02, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .06.\nThe effect was found for participants in the disappointment condition (b = .51, t(179) = 2.02, p = .05, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .02), but not in the remaining conditions (ps > .11). Results indicated a small, positive effect that suggests that individuals in the disappointment condition with higher need for affiliation were more likely to experience feelings of rejection, compared to each of the other conditions (see Table 4).\nWith regard to the emotional support and positive stimulation dimensions, mediation was not present. The effect of the mediation was largely driven by the social comparison subscale, F(3, 171) = 6.11, p = .001, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .10, and was again present in the disappointment condition, b = .73, t(177) = 4.00, p < .001, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .09. Participants in the disappointment condition who scored higher in social comparison tended to feel more rejected. No effects were observed in the other conditions, ps > .77.\nThe relationship between attention and group reactions was marginally nonsignificant (F(3, 173) = 2.64, p = .051, partial [[eta].sup.2] = .04), with a small to moderate effect size. The marginal difference was driven by the angry condition, (b = -.34, t(177) = -1.68, p = .10, partial [[eta].sup.2] = 0.02) which again was marginally nonsignificant. All other comparisons were nonsignificant, ps > .84.\nIn brief, the present study concluded that the IOS general did interact with the group reaction condition on acceptance/ rejection. The effect was largely driven by the social comparison subscale and to some extent the attention subscale, and existed primarily in the disappointment condition.\nRelationship between the Need for Affiliation and Conformity Measures\nFinally, the relationship between need for affiliation (as measured by the IOS) and the three conformity measures (i.e., cognitive conformity, behavioural conformity and affective conformity) was investigated using the Pearson correlation coefficient.\nAs shown in Table 5, there was a weak positive relationship between the IOS general and affective conformity, indicating that high levels of need for affiliation were associated with high feelings of pressure to conform. Furthermore, a weak positive correlation was found between the attention subscale and affective conformity, which shows that higher scores on attention were associated with higher feelings of conformity pressure. Interestingly, a weak negative relationship was found between the social comparison subscale and cognitive conformity, demonstrating that high levels of social comparison are related to lower levels of conforming to the group, while disregarding one's own thought. The final significant relationship that was present was a weak to moderate positive correlation between social comparison and affective conformity, which shows that higher scores on social comparison were associated with greater pressure to conform.",
        "limitations": "Limitations and Future Directions\nThere were several limitations to this study. First, the sample was obtained from a fairly demographically limited population as most participants were young adults, female and the majority identified as NZ European. Different results may have been obtained if the sample had included a similar male to female ratio, participants of more varied age, and with greater proportions of non-European ethnic identities. Gathering results from a diverse population ensures that results can be generalised to wider populations. It may be beneficial to include an equal female to male ratio and compare under which conformity measure females and males conform. It may also be worthwhile to examine whether there is a cultural difference between Maori and NZ European and the relationship of group reactions on conformity and feelings of acceptance and rejection.\nAn additional shortcoming of the present study was that the respondents were offered an incentive (koha) which involved a prize draw of a $100 shopping voucher. This might have had impacted the likelihood of true responses, as participants were more likely to complete the questionnaire with hopes of winning the prize draw and might not have been motivated to devote full cognitive resources to the task. The consequences of this lead to questions regarding the genuineness of participants' responses.\nAdditional enquiry into why there was only a cognitive change in conformity compared to a behavioural or affective change would also be valuable; for instance, whether an individual had an internal fear response regarding the consequences of leaving the group which prohibited them from actually leaving compared to simply considering it.\nSummary and Conclusion\nIn summary, this study has explored the cognitive, affective, and behavioural components of conformity and feelings of acceptance and rejection in response to group reactions. Furthermore, research regarding the moderating effects of need for affiliation on conformity in response to group reactions were also evaluated.\nThere was no direct relationship between group reactions and affective or behavioural conformity. There was, however, a relationship between group reactions and cognitive conformity. Furthermore, a relationship was found between group reactions and participants' feelings of acceptance/ rejection and between conformity pressure and behavioural conformity. Acceptance/rejection did not mediate the effect of group reaction on cognitive conformity, but the relationship between group reaction and acceptance/rejection was moderated by the (general) need for affiliation. A moderating effect for social comparison was found and a marginally nonsignificant interaction was found for attention. Finally, results indicated that there was a direct relationship between some elements of need for affiliation and conformity.\nThe results of the present study need to be cautiously interpreted. Nevertheless, the findings add to previous research and clarify the effects of group reactions on conformity and feelings of acceptance/rejection. It is hoped that the contributions of the present study encourage further research into the relationship of the need for affiliation and conformity.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe aim of the present experimental study was first to partially replicate the study conducted by Heerdink et al. (2013), to determine whether there was an effect of group reactions on conformity. The second objective was to determine whether there was an effect of group reactions on feelings of acceptance/rejection. From this, the we were interested in examining if the relationship between group reaction and conformity was mediated by feelings of acceptance/rejection. The third aim was to explore whether the need for affiliation mediates the relationship between group reactions and acceptance/rejection. The final aim was to investigate whether there was a direct relationship between the need for affiliation and conformity.\nKey findings suggest that there was no direct relationship between group reactions and affective or behavioural conformity. There was, however, a relationship between group reactions and cognitive conformity. Furthermore, results indicated there was a relationship between group reactions and participants' feelings of acceptance/rejection and between conformity pressure and behavioural conformity. However, acceptance/rejection did not mediate the effect of group reaction on cognitive conformity. The relationship between group reaction and acceptance/rejection was moderated by the (general) need for affiliation. It is important to note that a moderating effect for social comparison was found and a marginally nonsignificant interaction was found for attention. Finally, results indicated that there was a direct relationship between some elements of need for affiliation and conformity.\nManipulation Check\nIn the present study, the manipulation check replicated from Heerdink et al. (2013) showed inconsistent findings. Out of the four conditions, the disappointment condition was the only condition to be observed correctly by the majority of participants. In contrast to this finding, the manipulation check conducted by Heerdink et al. (2013) confirmed that the majority reaction was perceived correctly. Given that the present study's manipulation check was employed slightly differently, this could be a possible reason for the inconsistencies in the findings. For instance, at the completion of the experiment Heerdink et al. (2013) asked participants to demonstrate to what extent the group had reacted with anger, enthusiasm and disappointment (from 1 = not at all to 7 = very much). The present study added an additional reaction (i.e., neutral) and at the completion of the questionnaire asked participants to demonstrate which emotion was present in the above vignette, which was presented in a multiple choice format. In the present study's vignette, the group reactions were projected in a rather explicit manner, and one possibility is that participants inferred that it was an intentionally misleading question. For instance, at the end of the vignette participants in happy condition were told that the group members then 'smile and nod, clearly happy.' Clearly, a happy emotional response was demonstrated, yet the majority of participants still choose either disappointment or neutral.\nPerhaps a more realistic interpretation pertains to the ambiguous wording of the question (i.e., \"Please indicate which emotion was present in the above scenario\"). It is unclear whether this refers to the emotion expressed by the group members, the emotional reaction of the participant, the emotion initially expressed to the group by the participant, or some combination of the above. This ambiguity may be have affected participants' responses to the manipulation check item, despite the manipulation itself having the intended effect. An individually administered debriefing, or perhaps additional follow-up questions given to a subset of participants might have clarified the interpretation of this item. Unfortunately, this was not possible due to the anonymous and online nature of the data collection.\nGroup Reactions on Conformity\nThere were a number of inconsistencies between the results of the present study and those of Heerdink et al. (2013). One explanation could be due to the cultural identity of participants. Heerdink and colleagues (2013) did not specify the ethnicity of their participants; however, their study was conducted in the Netherlands, which is generally considered an individualistic culture (Triandis, 1994). collectivist cultures tend to define themselves as members of a group and subordinate their personal goals to the group's goals (Mills & Clark, 1982). On the other hand, individuals from an individualistic culture value individual achievement, self-reliance and personal goals (Fong & Wyer, 2003; Kim & Markus, 1999; Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 2001). People from individualistic cultures often have greater skill when it comes to entering and leaving new social groups, and they make acquaintances easily (Triandis, Bontempo, Villareal, Asai, & Lucca, 1988).\nAlthough the majority of participants in the present study identified as NZ European, there is a considerable influence of Maori and Pacific Island culture on New Zealand society (Houkamau & Sibley, 2010). Maori have strong connections with whanau (family) and iwi (tribe; Houkamau & Sibley, 2010). Furthermore, Pere (1979, 1988) noticed that whanaugatanga (i.e., the mutual responsibilities and relationships with group members) provide individuals with a sense of identity. Durie (1994) mentions that the Western ideal of independence and 'standing on your own two feet' is seen as maladaptive by Maori people, while interdependence, connectedness, and emphasis on whanau is actively encouraged. Unfortunately, sample sizes in the present research prevented further analyses to determine whether participants' ethnicity moderated the observed effects; however, it is possible that either a more collectivistic orientation or a greater cultural heterogeneity accounts for some of the variability in the data (Jetten, Postmes, & McAuliffe, 2002; Oh, 2013).\nGroup Reactions on Acceptance/Rejection\nIt was hypothesised that participants would feel more accepted if the group responds with happiness, whereas participants would feel more rejected if the group responds with either anger, disappointment, or a neutral emotion. In this study, results suggest that participants in the happy condition reported fewer feelings of rejection (i.e., feeling more accepted). This finding is consistent with Heerdink et al. (2013), who found that after an angry reaction, participants reported feeling more rejected, whereas after a happy response, participants felt more accepted. Despite what Heerdink et al. (2013) found, various limitations were discussed regarding the methodology. For example, the use of a vignette gave more experimental control but may be criticised for drawing on naive concepts about emotions (Parkinson & Manstead, 1993), rather than actual reactions to emotional expression.\nFurthermore, additional studies suggest that individuals who receive an angry expression tend to experience a threat to their need to belong (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). This is highly unpleasant and motivates one's behaviour to improve the level of acceptance in the group (Williams, 2007). Hollander (1960) argues that by conforming to the group norm, the deviant individual can show that they are a 'good' group member, which increases the likelihood of acceptance (Steinel et al., 2010; Van Kleef, Steinel, Van Knippenberg, Hogg, & Svensson, 2007).\nAcceptance/Rejection Mediating an Effect between Group Reactions and Cognitive Conformity\nOur study found a marginally nonsignificant effect for acceptance/rejection and cognitive conformity while controlling for group reactions. The effect for group reactions on cognitive conformity was still present, which indicates that full mediation is not possible. The small effect size for acceptance/rejection suggests that even partial mediation is unlikely. On the contrary, Heerdink et al. (2013) indicated that in situations that were perceived as more supportive, higher conformity pressure was experienced when anger was expressed. Interestingly, they found that this relationship was mediated by feelings of rejection; though in situations perceived as more competitive this mediation was not found (Heerdink et al., 2013).\nAcceptance/Rejection on Affective Conformity and Behavioural conformity\nFor both the additional conformity measures (e.g., affective and behavioural conformity), it was hypothesised that participants who felt greater rejection would conform more compared to those who felt more accepted, despite the lack of mediation of group responses.\nThe results for affective conformity indicate that the higher feelings of rejection an individual felt, the more pressure they felt to conform. In relation to the effect of acceptance/ rejection on behavioural conformity, results suggest that there is an effect of acceptance/rejection on behavioural conformity (i.e., intentions of leaving the group): as feelings of rejection increase, intentions of leaving the group decline. That is, participants who feel accepted are more likely to leave the group.\nResults from Heerdink et al. (2013) suggest that the majority's emotional expression influence feelings of acceptance or rejection. These feelings of acceptance/ rejection can influence how an individual relates to conformity pressures or impede behavioural conformity. According to Heerdink et al. (2013), when the majority expresses happiness in response to deviance, the deviant individual feels accepted and in turn, is not likely to change their behaviour and is expected to persist in deviance. On the other hand, if the majority expresses anger, the deviant individual feels rejected and therefore will most likely be motivated to re-establish their sense of belonging in the group by conforming (Heerdink et al., 2013). The consequence of behavioural conformity is that the deviant individuals opinion is eliminated and by conforming the individual can demonstrate commitment to the group's goals and identity (Klein, Spears, & Reicher, 2007), which in turn can increase acceptance from the group (Hollander, 1960; Levine & Moreland, 1994). It could be argued that feelings of rejection elicit a response that participants want to remain in the group in hopes to gain acceptance and show commitment. However, when an individual has feelings of acceptance within the group, the desire to gain the favour of the group is lessened because acceptance is met and comfort is found.\nNeed for Affiliation Moderating the Effect Between Group Reactions and Acceptance/Rejection\nThe present study demonstrated an interaction between group reactions and feelings of acceptance/rejection, which may be moderated by the need for affiliation. The effect was largely driven by the social comparison subscale and in the disappointment condition. For those individuals in the disappointed condition, a greater need for affiliation was associated with greater feelings of rejection. These findings to some extent support the hypothesis that need for affiliation functions acts as a moderator between group reactions and acceptance/rejection. In addition, partial mediation was suggested with regard to the attention subscale. This study represents the first attempt to examine the moderating effects of need for affiliation on group reactions and acceptance/ rejection. Although firm conclusions are difficult to draw based on the current findings, past literature suggests that need for affiliation could be an important variable in determining whether an individual remains independent or conforms to group norms (McGhee & Teevan, 1967).\nNeed for Affiliation and Conformity\nThe present study partially supported the hypothesis that there is an association between need for affiliation and conformity. There was a correlation between feelings of need for affiliation (general) and affective conformity; therefore, greater feelings for need for affiliation were associated with higher levels of pressure to conform. Furthermore, findings suggest a correlation between the attention subscale and affective conformity, and a relationship was found between the social comparison subscale and both cognitive and affective conformity.\nPast research has found inconsistencies in the relationship of need for affiliation and conformity. Several studies found that the need for affiliation is associated with conformity (Hardy, 1957; McGhee & Teevan, 1967; Rose et al., 1994; Schacter, 1951). However, additional studies suggest that there is no relationship between need for affiliation and conformity (Crutchfield, 1955; Samelson, 1957). One study by Hardy (1957), found that high need for affiliation groups conformed more under conditions of non-support than under conditions of support. The moderate need for affiliation group was found to conform under both conditions. However, the low need for affiliation group conformed more under conditions of support than non-support; though participants in the low group were considered to be responding more to the objective content compared to the social structure.\nBased on Heerdink et al. (2013) results, individuals who have greater feelings of need for affiliation felt more rejected and feelings of rejection was associated with higher pressure to conform or changes in behaviours related to conformity. Contradictions are still present, and questions remain regarding the association between need for affiliation and conformity; however, the present study represents an important step in understanding the nuances of this relationship.",

        "introduction": "I investigated the relationships among health consciousness, self-esteem, and successful aging in the context of South Korean baby boomers' engagement in leisure sports. The sample consisted of 530 baby boomers who actively participated in leisure sports in South Korea. Data collection was carried out through an online survey. Structural equation modeling revealed that health consciousness had a positive effect on both self-esteem and successful aging. Moreover, self-esteem had a positive effect on successful aging. My findings provide valuable insights to guide the formation of impactful strategies aimed at enriching the journey of successful aging within this specific demographic.\nKeywords baby boomer, leisure sports, health consciousness, self-esteem, successful aging\nArticle Highlights\n* Health consciousness was found to have a positive effect on self-esteem and successful aging among South Korean baby boomers engaging in leisure sports.\n* Self-esteem had a positive effect on successful aging.\n* This research contributes insights for formulating effective strategies for a successful aging experience.\nThe aging of populations presents distinct challenges at both personal and societal levels, manifesting in age-related diseases, physical and social inactivity, and subsequent impacts on individual quality of life (Banerjee, 2020). At the societal level, the increasing proportion of older adult citizens strains national finances due to a reduced working-age population and escalating healthcare costs (M. J. Kim & Kim, 2020; Restrepo & Rozental, 1994). In response to aging-related challenges, the concept of healthy aging has gained prominence. The World Health Organization (2021) defines healthy aging as \"developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being in older age\" (p. 9). This approach aims to enhance older individuals' overall quality of life through well-being and functional capacity. Similarly, the paradigm of successful aging has surfaced, shifting from traditional aging perspectives. Successful aging emphasizes disease prevention and health promotion, leveraging the potential inherent in older individuals, in contrast to the prior focus on negative factors such as loss or decline (Reichstadt et al., 2007; Rowe & Kahn, 1998; Ryff, 1982).\nSelf-esteem, which is an important factor in achieving successful aging (Bae, 2020), is defined as the extent to which someone perceives themself as a meaningful, capable, and successful individual (Coopersmith, 1981). In the case of Korean baby boomers, the higher their self-esteem, the higher are their scores on positive psychological variables such as life satisfaction, subjective happiness, and subjective quality of life (T. S. Kang, 2018; M. J. Lee, 2023; Seo, 2018).\nWell-being likewise acts as a determinant of successful aging. Rowe and Kahn (1997), who were foundational to the development of the concept of successful aging, identified \"low probability of disease and disease-related disability, high cognitive and physical functional capacity, and active engagement with life\" (p. 433) as key components. Baltes and Baltes (1990) stressed individual considerations and continuous interaction with the environment to minimize the negative effects and maximize the positive outcomes of aging, despite the inevitable physical or cognitive decline. Scholars have highlighted the profound connections between physical, psychological, and social well-being in achieving successful aging (e.g., Fisher & Specht, 1999).\nHealth consciousness, which is defined as \"the degree to which health concerns are integrated into a person's daily activities\" (Jayanti & Burns, 1998, p. 5), has a substantial influence on preventive healthcare behaviors that contribute to an individual's overall life span. Health-conscious individuals take an interest in preserving and enhancing their health in their daily lives (Hong, 2009), and strive to enhance their well-being by simultaneously adopting multiple health behaviors (Newsom et al., 2005).\nIn advanced welfare states, national policies have been implemented to create an environment that fosters health management through leisure sports participation, with the goal of achieving successful aging even before individuals reach old age (Noh & Kim, 2009). Leisure sports activities, which form a key policy initiative in South Korea, positively address fundamental human needs, including health, self-expression, self-realization, self-esteem, and physical activity (Cheng et al., 2017; Mannell, 2007).\nThe population of South Korea, as of 2023, includes approximately 9.5 million older adults (18.4%), making it one of the world's fastest aging nations (Statistics Korea, 2023). This trend largely stems from the baby boomer generation, born between 1955 and 1963, who numbered around 7.2 million as of 2020 (Statistics Korea, 2021). The initial wave, born in 1955, entered older adulthood in 2020, with an estimated 690,000 to 920,000 more projected to join this age group by 2028 (Song & Won, 2020). Distinguished by high levels of education, strong economic power, and high professional competence, South Korean baby boomers differ from earlier generations (E. Kim, 2021; J. H. Lee, 2019; Rha et al., 2008) and also show within-group differences in areas such as health, life expectancy, education, and retirement preparedness, which are influenced by individual factors (C. J. Park, 2014). Consequently, the degree of successful aging may vary among individuals.\nA systematic review revealed that older adults' definition of successful aging differs across countries and cultures (Reich et al., 2020). This implies the need to examine successful aging within the context of a particular country or culture, as is the case in this study, in which I focused on Northeast Asia by recruiting a sample of South Korean baby boomers. South Korea faces the challenge of becoming a super-aged society, necessitating preparation. While research examining the successful aging of baby boomers is pivotal for enhancing public health and welfare within an aged society (Foster & Walker, 2015), there exists a scarcity of studies focusing on successful aging among South Korean baby boomers.\nI investigated the structural relationships between health consciousness, self-esteem, and successful aging among baby boomers engaged in leisure sports. My aim was to contribute essential insights for formulating effective strategies to promote successful aging among baby boomers in South Korea. The research model is presented in Figure 1.\nResearch Hypotheses\nIn the later stages of life, various changes, including shifts in social interactions, may contribute to feelings of loneliness among older adults. However, proactive engagement in health behaviors, such as regular physical activity and exercise, may mitigate loneliness and promote self-esteem and psychological or social well-being (Y. S. Kim, 2001; Y. R. Kim, 2006; Ma, 2001). Given prior studies (Breslow & Enstrom, 1980; Hong, 2009) have shown that health consciousness can predict proactive health behavior, I established the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: Health consciousness among baby boomers participating in leisure sports will positively affect their self-esteem.\nWithin the realm of successful aging, health-related behaviors have been a focal point of research (Goo & Kang, 2015; Y. H. Lee, 2011). The significance of engaging in leisure-time physical activities or exercise for promoting successful aging has been further emphasized in numerous studies (e.g., Ahn & Shin, 2017; C. I. Lee & Park, 2020). Thus, I established the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2: Health consciousness among baby boomers participating in leisure sports will positively affect their successful aging.\nIn the context of successful aging, self-esteem emerges as a crucial psychological factor that profoundly influences overall quality of life and well-being among older adults (Choi et al., 2009; Chung, 2004; D. G Lee, 2013). Numerous researchers have suggested the positive impact of self-esteem on the attainment of successful aging among diverse groups of older adults (Bae, 2020; D. H. Kim, 2014; H. Y. Lee, 2016). Thus, I established the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 3: Self-esteem among baby boomers participating in leisure sports will positively affect their successful aging.",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants and Procedure\nThe participants in this study were baby boomers in South Korea, born between 1955 and 1963, who participated in leisure sports. I conducted an online survey through Macromille Embrain in South Korea from September to November 2021. The survey was administered to individuals listed in the company's database after providing them with a comprehensive explanation of the research purpose and obtaining their consent for participation. Respondents initiated the survey by clicking on a hyperlink provided within the email invitation, then a screening question was presented: \"Have you previously engaged in leisure sports activities?\" To enhance response rates, the survey company offered a monetary incentive of USD 1.00 to all participants who successfully completed the survey.\nThere were 540 participants, of whom 10 were excluded because they had missing data or unreliable responses; thus, 530 valid questionnaires were analyzed. Among the respondents, 50% (n = 265) were men, 50% (n = 265) were women, and 51.3% (n = 272) were born between 1960 and 1963, with the rest (48.7%, n = 258) being born between 1955 and 1959.\nMeasures\nThe variables were measured using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.\nHealth Consciousness\nThe health-consciousness measure I used consisted of five items (e.g., \"I'm currently improving my mental and physical health by participating in leisure sports\") that were modified according to the purpose of the study (K. R. Kim, 2000; S. Y. Lee et al., 1995).\nSelf-Esteem\nThe 10-item self-esteem scale I used was developed by Rosenberg (1965) and adapted by Jeon (1974). It includes six items related to positive self-esteem (e.g., \"I feel I am as valuable as others\") and four items related to negative self-esteem (e.g., \"I tend to think of myself as a failure\"). Negative self-esteem items are reverse scored.\nSuccessful Aging\nThe 31-item successful aging scale used in this study was modified from the successful aging measure for Korean older adults developed by D. B. Kim (2008). Dimensions include autonomous life (six items; e.g., \"I try to break unhealthy habits\"), self-completion orientation (six items; e.g., \"I have a plan I want to achieve in life\"), positive life participation (five items; e.g., \"I tend to make friends easily\"), satisfaction with one's offspring (five items; e.g., \"I am proud of my children\"), self-acceptance (three items; e.g., \"I am satisfied with the house I live in\"), and other-acceptance (three items; e.g., \"I tend to accept younger generations' opinions\").",

        "results": "Results\nCronbach's alphas, descriptive statistics, and correlation analysis results are shown in Table 1. Cronbach's alphas exceeded the minimum criterion of .70, indicating acceptable reliability. The correlation coefficients between the variables were less than .80, indicating that they were independent of each other and multicollinearity was not a significant concern. Prior to testing the hypotheses, I conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to confirm the validity and goodness of fit of the measures used in this study. The measurement model demonstrated an excellent fit to the data, chi square ([chi square]) = 2042.519, degrees of freedom (df) = 942, comparative fit index (CFI) = .91, Tucker--Lewis index (TLI) = .90, root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .05.\nUsing maximum likelihood estimation, I analyzed the structural model of participants' health consciousness, self-esteem, and successful aging. The model satisfied the criteria for acceptable goodness of fit, [chi square] = 243.46, df = 60, CFI = .95, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .07. I then tested the hypotheses through structural equation modeling. The results demonstrated that health consciousness was significantly and positively related to self-esteem (.32, p < .001) and successful aging (.19, p < .001). Further, self-esteem was significantly and positively related to successful aging (.86, p < .001). Thus, all of my hypotheses were supported.",

        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe findings of this study underscore the significant role of health consciousness and self-esteem in the context of successful aging through participation in leisure sports among baby boomers. To begin with, there is a noteworthy positive influence of health consciousness on self-esteem. Although research examining the direct relationship between health consciousness and self-esteem is limited, previous studies have reported that higher levels of health consciousness tend to be associated with increased engagement in health-promotion behaviors (Ha & Choi, 2013). Drawing from the insights of previous studies on health-promotion behaviors, involvement in physical activity and exercise contributes positively to the enhancement of self-esteem in older adults (Y. S. Kim, 2001; Y. R. Kim, 2006; Ma, 2001). Additionally, S. H. Park and Park (2015) demonstrated that an integrated health and wellness program comprising nutritional guidance, exercise regimens, and psychological support contributed to heightened health consciousness among senior individuals. Notably, various local governments in South Korea have undertaken initiatives to provide an array of resources and programs designed to augment the well-being of retired baby boomers, encompassing aspects such as health, exercise, liberal arts, life design, retirement preparedness, and vocational education (Jang, 2021). Hence, this emerges as a potential avenue for promoting health ons iousness and enhan ing self-esteem.\nFurthermore, my analysis has revealed that health consciousness has a positive effect on successful aging. While direct research examining the correlation between increased health consciousness and successful aging remains limited, the existing literature has unveiled a link between health consciousness and health-promotion behaviors (Ha & Choi, 2013). For instance, J. J. Kim et al. (2013) demonstrated that the health-promotion behaviors exhibited by older adults engaging in community dance programs positively influence successful aging, and Ahn and Shin (2017) identified health-promotion behavior as a predictor of successful aging. In a similar vein, participation in leisure sports programs and activities has been shown to contribute to successful aging among older adults (C. I. Lee & Park, 2020; J. S. Lee, 2019), suggesting that engagement in recreational sports, possibly fueled by enhanced health consciousness, fosters the experience of successful aging. Korea witnessed a nearly twofold increase in medical expenditures for older adults over a 6-year period, from 19.9 trillion won in 2014 to 36.3 trillion won in 2020, with an anticipated escalation to approximately 91 trillion won by 2030 (H. G. Kang, 2021). This mounting financial strain on medical resources can be attributed to the rising prevalence of chronic ailments, such as hypertension and diabetes, accompanying the aging population. Consequently, the active development and dissemination of health-promotion initiatives that encompass the physical, mental, and social aspects of older adults within welfare facilities like senior centers, community halls, and senior classrooms--all conveniently accessible to local older adults--holds the potential to elicit increased health consciousness among those who participate in these programs. This strategic approach may alleviate the burden of healthcare costs and have a positive impact on the experience of successful aging among older adults.\nLast, I have ascertained that self-esteem bears a positive association with successful aging, which is congruent with earlier research (Bae, 2020; H. M. Kim, 2014; K. H. Lee, 2016). This suggests that elevated levels of self-esteem might foster an augmented sense of fulfillment and significance in daily life experiences (Han, 2001), thereby contributing to successful aging through the enhancement of mental well-being. Building on this premise, B. J. Lee and Hong (2012) proposed that leisure activities hold the potential to cultivate elevated self-esteem levels among older adults. Consequently, it is recommended that both governmental bodies and local authorities invest proactively in the development of proficient professionals capable of guiding leisure pursuits for older adults. Furthermore, the activation of leisure activity programs tailored to the preferences and motivations of older adults can foster enhanced self-esteem and an enriched experience of successful aging within this demographic.\nLimitations and Directions for Future Research\nThis study does bear some limitations. First, given that the participants were all baby boomers actively engaged in leisure sports, stratifying the sample into leisure sports participants and nonparticipants could unveil more nuanced outcomes, thereby further elucidating the intricate relationships among subvariables. Second, given that this study's methodology was centered around quantitative research involving survey data, it is recommended that qualitative approaches, such as interviews, be used in future research. Qualitative methods have the potential to capture multidimensional and detailed perspectives, thereby facilitating a more profound exploration of insights and outcomes.",

        "introduction": "To test the relationship between social face consciousness (SFC) and life satisfaction (LS) among new employees in a Chinese context, we administered the Consciousness of Social Face Scale, the Satisfaction With Life Scale, the Perceived Social Support Scale, and the Ruminative Responses Scale to 624 employees with 1 year or less of service in the job market. The results showed that SFC had a significant negative predictive effect on new employees' LS, and indirectly affected new employees' LS through perceived social support. Further, rumination played a significant role in moderating the influence of SFC on new employees' LS; specifically, for new employees with a low level of rumination, SFC had no significant predictive effect on LS, whereas for those with a high level of rumination, SFC had a significant negative predictive effect on their LS. Thus, SFC inhibits new employees' LS and affects LS through the intermediary role of perceived social support, while rumination moderates this relationship. This study provides insight into how new employees can improve their LS in practice.\nKeywords\nnew employees, social face consciousness, life satisfaction, perceived social support, rumination\nIn recent years, positive factors such as life satisfaction (LS), subjective well-being, awe, optimism, and hope have received widespread research attention (Connolly & Garling, 2023; Dai & Jiang, 2023; Feldman et al., 2023). While happiness has been shown to be the most-reported life goal pursued, LS reflects how an individual evaluates their overall quality of life, and is therefore often regarded as a key indicator of subjective well-being (Kim et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021), which can predict an individual's physical and mental health (Uchino et al., 2016). In the increasingly competitive business environment, turning graduates into excellent employees is key for enterprises to maintain their talent competitiveness and growing sustainability (Hu et al., 2020). New employees must negotiate the transformation in their identity from student to employee, going through the adaptation process to workplace life. This major shift in identity and life can be a great challenge for new employees, and will have an important impact on their physical and mental development. Therefore, exploring the mechanism of new employees' LS is of great value in terms of understanding the psychological status of new employees, with a view to determining key time points for interventions if necessary.\nSocial Face Consciousness and New Employees' Life Satisfaction\nPersonality has been shown to be an important factor affecting individual LS. Previous studies have found that the Big Five personality traits (Hansson et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2021; Smith & Konik, 2021), positive personality traits (Y. L. Zhang et al., 2021), and proactive personality traits (S. L. Wang et al., 2019) can significantly predict LS. However, few scholars have paid attention to the relationship between \"social face,\" as the personality element, and LS. As a qualifier of social costs, social face, as understood throughout thousands of years of Chinese cultural heritage and deeply rooted in the hearts of the Chinese people, refers to the sequential or psychological status of someone in the eyes of others. Social face consciousness (SFC) refers to the consciousness that people have in terms of gaining face or avoiding loss of face in their social interactions, and there are two kinds: face struggle, namely, working to increase or gain face, and face protection, which entails attempting to avoid face damage (X.-A. Zhang et al., 2011). New employees with strong SFC often want to demonstrate excellence or show off their skills by exaggerating or boasting about their performance, and keeping their shortcomings unnoticed or hidden (C. Wang & Zhang, 2021). Therefore, when talking about their weaknesses, these employees find ways to redirect topics of conversation when necessary. This untrue self-presentation, however, has been found to be associated with a high level of social anxiety (Twomey & O'Reilly, 2017), which leads to a lower level of LS (L. Wang & Yao, 2020). Thus, we formed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: Social face consciousness will have a significantly negative predictive effect on new employees' life satisfaction.\nPerceived Social Support as a Mediator\nPerceived social support (PSS) refers to an individual's belief that others support and understand them (Sarason et al., 1991). As an important external resource, PSS is of great significance to people's physical and mental health (Chow et al., 2022; Hui et al., 2023). A study of laid-off workers showed that because of being embarrassed about their situation and afraid of being looked down upon by others, laid-off workers tend to reduce their social interactions to alleviate the social pressure they feel others exert on them, which leads to their feeling less social support (X. Y. Wang, 2005). According to the buffer theory perspective (Aneshensel & Stone, 1982), PSS can cushion the detrimental effects of negative stimuli on individuals, enabling them to avoid all kinds of negative emotions and helping them to better regulate the relationship between various adverse stimuli and their mental health (Jin et al., 2020). In addition, empirical studies have shown that PSS has a positive predictive effect on LS (Han et al., 2021; Miao et al., 2020). New employees with a low level of SFC do not consciously expect themselves to be sensational in front of their colleagues, nor will they feel ashamed or embarrassed for being, or feeling, inferior to their colleagues. Therefore, such new employees often do not feel greater psychological pressure and present themselves as having a relaxed state when interacting with colleagues. Such harmonious social communication often receives positive feedback from those with whom they are communicating, which results in their feeling a higher level of social support. Furthermore, when these new employees encounter difficulties, their high level of PSS enables them to feel the goodwill of their colleagues, which, in turn, feeds back into their developing a higher level of personal LS. We therefore proposed the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 2: Perceived social support will play a mediating role between social face consciousness and new employees' life satisfaction.\nRumination as a Moderator\nRumination refers to the act of continuously paying attention to all kinds of negative thoughts, particularly those related to oneself; individuals engaging in rumination repeatedly think about the causes and consequences of these negative thoughts, without actively solving the problem (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). Rumination has been shown to have a significant negative correlation with LS, and it can also negatively predict LS (Zheng et al., 2019). Previous research has shown that individuals with a high level of rumination tend to be entangled in past misbehaviors, and they repeatedly experience negative emotions such as regret (Allaert et al., 2023). If individuals are more inclined to pay attention to their own shortcomings and deficiencies, they then encode this negative information more concretely, which may lead to more rumination (Tafarodi et al., 2003). However, a high level of SFC means that individuals will pay more attention to their position in others' minds, and expect to cover up their shortcomings, performing well in front of others (C. Wang & Zhang, 2021), which is very similar to the behavior style of people with a high level of rumination. Individuals with a high level of rumination often experience high anxiety and depression (Dogan, 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Petwal et al., 2023), and low levels of LS (Zheng et al., 2019). When SFC and rumination work together, individuals not only hope that they can perform better than others, but also fear that their shortcomings may be revealed to their colleagues. When such individuals encounter negative events, they experience a variety of negative thoughts and find it difficult to let go of the negative effects of the event in a timely manner, making it more difficult to experience a higher level of LS. Therefore, we formed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 3: Rumination will play a moderating role in the influence of social face consciousness on new employees' life satisfaction, such that a high level of rumination will strengthen the negative effect of social face consciousness on life satisfaction.",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants and Procedure\nThe Ethics Committee of Inner Mongolia Normal University approved this study. Through a combination of cluster and individual sampling, we selected as participants new employees living in Liaoning Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, who had been in the job market for 1 year or less. All participants gave informed consent, then completed a paper-and-pencil survey in groups at suitable times at their workplace. The survey included questions about demographic variables (e.g., gender and age) and four scales: the Consciousness of Social Face Scale, the Satisfaction With Life Scale, the Perceived Social Support Scale, and the Ruminative Responses Scale. We handed out 700 questionnaires and collected 624 valid forms, for a response rate of 89.14%. Of the final sample, 286 were men (45.8%) and 338 were women (54.2%); the average age was 25.79 years (SD = 1.45, range = 22-28); 305 worked in state-owned enterprises (48.9%) and 319 in private enterprises (51.1%); and 141 held a junior college degree (22.6%) and 483 had a bachelor's degree (77.4%).\nMeasures\nSocial Face Consciousness\nThe Consciousness of Social Face Scale (X.-A. Zhang et al., 2011) comprises 11 items scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The scale includes two dimensions: desire to gain face (e.g., \"I hope people think that I can do better than most others\") and fear of losing face (e.g., \"I do my best to hide my weakness before others\"). In this study the Cronbach's alphas of the subscales were .86 and .85, respectively, and that of the scale as a whole was .90.\nLife Satisfaction\nThe Satisfaction With Life Scale (Diener et al., 1985) comprises five items scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). A sample item is \"I am satisfied with my life.\" The scale has a one-dimensional structure; the higher the total score, the higher the individual's level of LS. In this study the Cronbach's alpha of the scale was .88.\nPerceived Social Support\nThe Perceived Social Support Scale (Zimet et al., 1988) comprises 12 items scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The scale includes three dimensions: family support (e.g., \"My family really tries to help me\"), friend support (e.g., \"My friends really try to help me\"), and other support (e.g., \"There is a special person in my life who cares about my feelings\"). In this study the Cronbach's alpha of the subscales were .85, .83, and .83 respectively, and that of the scale as a whole was .89.\nRumination\nThe Ruminative Responses Scale (Treynor et al., 2003) comprises 22 items scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (always). The scale includes three dimensions: reflection (e.g., \"Go someplace alone to think about your feelings\"), brooding (e.g., \"Think 'Why can't I handle things better?'\"), and depression (e.g., \"Think about how sad you feel\"). In this study the Cronbach's alphas of the subscales were .73, .81, and .91 respectively, and that of the scale as a whole was .93.",

        "results": "Results\nTest of Common Method Bias and Primary Analysis\nHarman's single-factor test was used to examine if there was common method bias in the data. We standardized all items. Results showed there were nine common factors with eigenvalues greater than 1, and the explanation rate of the first common factor was 23.21%; as this is less than the 40% cut-off (Podsakoff et al., 2003), we determined that there was no serious common method bias in this study.\nTable 1 shows the means and standard deviations of the principle variables. We first controlled for the demographic variables of gender, age, type of work unit, and educational background, and standardized the focal variables of SFC, PSS, rumination, and LS. The results showed that SFC was significantly and negatively correlated with PSS and new employees' LS, and significantly and positively correlated with rumination. PSS was significantly and negatively correlated with rumination, and significantly and positively correlated with new employees' LS. Rumination was significantly and negatively correlated with new employees' LS.\nHypothesis Testing\nModel 5 in PROCESS version 3.3 (Hayes, 2012) was employed to test the association between SFC and new employees' LS, and to determine whether PSS mediated and rumination moderated this relationship. Gender, age, type of work unit, and educational background served as control variables. The results (see Table 2) showed that SFC had a significant predictive effect on PSS and new employees' LS, and PSS significantly predicted new employees' LS. The direct effect of SFC on new employees' LS was significant (t = -4.02, p < .001). The indirect effect of PSS as a mediator of the relationship between SFC and new employees' LS was also significant, effect value -0.04. Thus, Hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported.\nAlso shown in Table 2, the interaction between SFC and rumination had a significant predictive effect on new employees' LS, 95% confidence interval [-0.13, -0.01]. To better explain the moderating function of rumination, we carried out a simple slope analysis. The results showed that for new employees with a low level of rumination (M - 1 SD), SFC had no significant predictive effect on LS (b = -0.12, SE = 0.07, t = -1.78, p > .05). However, for those with a high level of rumination (M + 1 SD), SFC had a significant negative predictive effect on their LS (b = -0.26, SE = 0.04, t = -6.48, p < .001). This supported Hypothesis 3.",
        "limitations": "",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe results of this study show that SFC significantly and negatively predicts new employees' LS, supporting Hypothesis 1. Previous findings have also shown that SFC can negatively predict LS (Chen & He, 2017), and face-saving behavior has been shown to cause Chinese-Americans to experience higher psychological pressure (Mak et al., 2009). For recently graduated employees new to the workplace, leaving campus to enter the workforce requires a complete transformation from student to employee identity in both body and mind. This stage of life also entails learning new work skills and sudden, intense accumulation of work experience. New employees often strive to show off their talents in the workplace, hoping to make a good impression on their leaders and colleagues. New employees with a strong sense of face are eager to avoid negative evaluations caused by losing face, and are more likely to exhibit behaviors that meet social expectations or social requirements, potentially ignoring their own inner needs or personal preferences. This eventually leads to damaging their sense of LS (C. X. Wang & Zhu, 2016).\nIn this study we also found that PSS plays a partial intermediary role in influencing the mechanism of SFC on new employees' LS, which supported Hypothesis 2. New employees with a strong level of SFC often have a high level of need to gain face as well as fearing losing face. Gaining face consciousness causes new employees to want to be better than others, which can include vanity, showing off, and boasting. Previous studies have shown that if individuals are more vain and more likely to show off or boast during interpersonal communications, this will often affect their maintenance and development of interpersonal relationships (F. Z. Yu, 2018). Eventually, when new employees encounter difficulties, the damage caused to their interpersonal relationships will result in them struggling to access the social support they require, making it difficult for them to feel a high level of PSS. Meanwhile, fear of losing face is reflected by new employees wanting to hide their shortcomings or deficiencies from others, so that when they face difficulties, they will tend to stay silent. This makes it difficult for others to understand the difficulties faced by the new employees at a point when they can offer necessary support, resulting in the new employees being unable to obtain a high level of PSS. Previous studies have also shown that there is a significant positive correlation between PSS and LS, and PSS can positively predict LS (Han et al., 2021; M. L. Yu et al., 2020). Therefore, when new employees have a high level of SFC, this will often lead to a lower level of PSS, which, in turn, leads to them experiencing a lower level of LS.\nIn addition, we found that rumination significantly moderates the relationship between SFC and new employees' LS, which supported Hypothesis 3. Specifically, for new employees with a low level of rumination, SFC has no significant predictive effect on LS. However, for those with a high level of rumination, SFC has a significant negative predictive effect on their LS. When the individual has a higher level of rumination, the scope of that individual's attention will be reduced, as well as their self-control (Jin et al., 2018). Thus, it is difficult for such individuals to face problems realistically, and easier for them to produce more negative emotions (Y. L. Wang et al., 2020). In life, individuals with a high level of rumination will repeatedly pay attention to their negative mood, habitually forcing themselves to think about their bad situation and reasons, and immersing themselves in sadness. This way of thinking will activate negative self-cognition (Feng et al., 2023), negative self-reference processing, and negative emotion, and persistent rumination impairs the individual's ability to problem solve and manage emotions, making this a maladaptive cognitive style (Ando' et al., 2020), which is closely related to depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other mental disorders (Dodd et al., 2019; Kertz et al., 2019; Kraus et al., 2020; Mihailova & Jobson, 2020). In addition, individuals with a high level of rumination are more likely than are those with a low level of rumination to be afraid of interacting with others, since they worry about not doing well and tend to immerse themselves in negative emotions in interpersonal communication (Qin & Peng, 2024), which will have a negative impact on their level of life satisfaction (Foroughi et al., 2022). In short, rumination is often accompanied by negative emotional experience. Repeated thinking and the resulting negative emotional experience are important factors that create the negative effect of SFC (C. Wang, 2023). Rumination, as a negative personality trait, will thus magnify the negative influence of SFC on new employees' LS.\nIn this study we examined the influence of SFC on new employees' LS, the mediating role of PSS, and the moderating role of rumination. We have provided theoretical references and practical understanding of how to improve the LS of new employees. First, the SFC of new employees can be reduced through special psychological interventions, such as induction training and inclusion as part of the daily work process. New employees can be influenced through the use of carefully chosen words or behaviors with the aim of reducing their level of SFC. Employers can also screen new employees for SFC through the use of questionnaires or interviews, and professional training can be carried out in the workplace to reduce their level of SFC with the goal of improving their LS. Second, in improving new employees' LS, long-term interventions related to their sense of PSS can also be considered. By encouraging new employees to focus on a positive and healthy attitude, they could be influenced to change their negative work and life patterns. Guiding new employees to develop an ideology of colleagues being like family could encourage them to actively seek help when they encounter difficulties or to lend a helping hand to others in need, thus improving new employees' ability to perceive social support through practice. This could also be considered as a way to improve new employees' ability to perceive social support through the reduction of their sense of social face, therefore leading to an improvement in their level of LS. Finally, by screening new employees for a high level of rumination by means of questionnaires or interviews, interventions could be introduced to reduce their level of rumination, such as expressive writing or mindfulness training. Encouraging new employees with a high level of rumination to participate in such activities could lead them to shift their inherent cognitive model to become more conducive to better moods and more skilled in objective cognitive ability, thus positively impacting their level of LS.\nThis study is subject to the following limitations: First, we distinguished between the types of work units of new employees, but did not distinguish between their occupations. In future research, we will examine the relationship between the SFC and LS of new employees with different occupations. Second, we focused on new employees and did not examine employees who have worked for many years. Can our research results be extended to long-term employees? This needs to be examined in future research. Third, we collected data mainly by means of a questionnaire survey, which means the results of the study may be affected by social desirability bias. We recommend verifying our current research results by means of experimental study approaches.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors have no known conflict of interest to disclose.\nThe raw data supporting the research conclusions can be obtained from the corresponding authors.",

        "introduction": "This study investigates the impact of Philosophy-Based Language Teaching (PBLT) on the critical thinking skills and learner engagement of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students. A concurrent mixed-methods approach, including semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and academic achievement tests, was employed with an experimental group (EG) exposed to PBLT and a control group (CG) receiving traditional instruction. The results reveal a substantial positive effect of PBLT on the critical thinking abilities of EFL learners, as evidenced by thematic analyses of interviews and document content. Themes include heightened critical thinking awareness, collaborative knowledge construction, and increased learner engagement. Academic achievement tests further demonstrate significant improvement in the experimental group's performance. A comparison with existing literature underscores the novelty of our mixed-methods approach. Implications for language teachers, materials developers, syllabus designers, and policy-makers are discussed, highlighting the potential of PBLT in cultivating critical thinking and learner engagement.\nKeywords: Academic achievement, Critical thinking, Engagement, Philosophy-based Language Teaching\nAuthor(s): Lingxi Li1 , Sayed M. Ismail2 , Indrajit Patra3 and Desta Lami4\nIntroduction\nLanguage teaching has witnessed the emergence and evolution of various teaching approaches over time. While some approaches have gained more prominence than others, scholars acknowledge that no approach is flawless. Additionally, certain approaches are recognized for their effectiveness in honing specific skills rather than others. For instance, communicative language teaching (CLT) and content and language-integrated learning (CLIL) are deemed crucial for oral skill development, whereas genre-based pedagogy predominantly focuses on written texts [1]. More recently, a novel approach known as PBLT has surfaced in the literature [2-4]. This approach has proven to assist EFL learners not only in enhancing speaking and writing skills but also in developing critical thinking skills. PBLT revolves around two central elements: posing philosophical questions and viewing the classroom as a community of inquiry. The approach stems from the observation that when philosophical questions arise in the EFL class, learners spontaneously engage and feel motivated to participate actively in discussions.\nPBLT, centered around posing philosophical questions and viewing the classroom as a community of inquiry [2-4], emerges from the observation that when philosophical questions arise in the EFL class [4], learners spontaneously engage and feel motivated to participate actively in discussions [3]. This active involvement goes beyond the surface of language acquisition, delving into the realm of critical thinking. As learners grapple with philosophical inquiries, they are prompted to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information, fostering a cognitive process that extends beyond the immediate linguistic context [3]. In this way, philosophy-based language instruction serves as a catalyst for nurturing critical thinking skills among EFL learners [5].\nCritical thinking is a foundational skill essential for effective decision-making and problem-solving in education and beyond [6]. In the realm of language instruction, critical thinking goes beyond the mere acquisition of language skills, involving the ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information [7]. PBLT has emerged as a distinctive approach fostering critical thinking skills among EFL learners [8-9]. Through the exploration of philosophical questions, students are encouraged to question assumptions, consider alternative viewpoints, and articulate well-reasoned responses. Engagement with complex philosophical inquiries not only deepens linguistic proficiency but also nurtures cognitive processes associated with critical thinking. PBLT provides a unique space where learners actively participate in discussions, offering them the opportunity to navigate linguistic and conceptual complexities simultaneously. As a result, critical thinking becomes an integral aspect of language learning within the framework of PBLT, contributing to the development of discerning and analytically astute language learners.\nEngagement involves showcasing learning motivation, where learners direct energy and effort toward achieving specific educational goals [10-11]. Defining student engagement comprises three interconnected dimensions: behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Behavioral engagement encompasses active student participation in learning activities, such as posing questions and completing assignments [12]. Emotional engagement relates to students' feelings regarding teachers, peers, or the learning process, including reactions like interest, boredom, happiness, sadness, and anxiety during a course [13]. The core concept of cognitive engagement focuses on the depth of investment in learning, highlighting a psychological commitment to mastering knowledge and skills rather than merely completing tasks [12]. Therefore, cognitive engagement can be understood as students' grasp of the subject matter being taught [14].\nAcademic achievement is a multifaceted concept encompassing the attainment of knowledge, skills, and competencies within an educational context [15]. In the field of language instruction, academic achievement is often measured by students' proficiency in language skills, successful completion of language courses, and performance in assessments [16]. PBLT emerges as a dynamic approach that not only enhances linguistic proficiency but also contributes to broader academic achievement [2-3].\nThe contemporary landscape of language instruction is characterized by a myriad of teaching approaches, each offering unique strengths and challenges. While approaches such as CLT and content and language-integrated learning CLIL have gained prominence for their efficacy in specific skill development, a critical examination reveals that no singular approach is without its limitations [1]. Moreover, the emphasis on honing particular skills often overshadows the holistic development of learners. In this context, the recent emergence of PBLT introduces a novel dimension to language instruction by not only enhancing speaking and writing skills but also fostering critical thinking abilities among EFL learners [2-4]. However, despite the promising indications, a comprehensive investigation into the efficacy of PBLT in comparison to traditional approaches is notably absent in the current literature. This research gap prompts the need for a focused exploration into the consequences of philosophy-based language instruction on EFL learners' critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement. By addressing this gap, the study seeks to contribute valuable insights that can inform language educators and policymakers about the potential benefits and challenges associated with the integration of PBLT in EFL classrooms.\nThis study aims to achieve three overarching objectives that collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the impact of PBLT on EFL learners. Firstly, the investigation seeks to understand the effect of PBLT on critical thinking skills among EFL learners. This involves a close examination of how the integration of philosophy-based language instruction influences cognitive processes such as analysis, evaluation, and synthesis. By assessing the impact on critical thinking, the study aims to illuminate the cognitive dimensions that PBLT brings to language learning.\nSecondly, the study aims to assess the effect of PBLT on learner engagement. This involves an exploration of the extent to which philosophy-based language teaching enhances learner motivation and active participation in the language learning process. The investigation encompasses the examination of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive dimensions of engagement, providing insights into how PBLT contributes to creating a stimulating and participatory classroom environment.\nLastly, the study seeks to evaluate the effect of PBLT on academic achievement. This involves a comprehensive assessment of the impact of philosophy-based language instruction on traditional measures of academic success, including language proficiency, course completion rates, and performance in assessments. By examining both linguistic and broader academic competencies, the study aims to provide a holistic understanding of how PBLT influences learners' overall academic achievement within the EFL context. Accordingly, the study addresses the following research questions:\n1. How does PBLT affect learners' critical thinking?\n2. How does PLBT affect learners' engagement?\n3. What is the effect of PBLT on learners' academic achievement?\nThis study aims to achieve three primary objectives that hold significant implications for both language educators and policymakers. Firstly, by investigating the effect of PBLT on critical thinking skills among EFL learners, the study offers insights into how philosophy-based language instruction shapes cognitive processes essential for effective language acquisition. Understanding this impact not only enriches our knowledge of language learning methodologies but also provides educators with evidence-based strategies to enhance learners' critical thinking abilities, which are crucial for navigating an increasingly complex world. Secondly, by assessing the effect of PBLT on learner engagement, the study contributes to our understanding of how philosophy-based approaches can foster a more stimulating and participatory classroom environment. This knowledge equips educators with tools to create learning environments that promote active participation and motivation, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of language education. Lastly, by evaluating the effect of PBLT on academic achievement, the study informs policymakers about the broader implications of philosophy-based language instruction on traditional measures of academic success. This understanding can guide policy decisions regarding curriculum development, teacher training, and resource allocation, ultimately shaping the direction of language education policies to better serve the needs of EFL learners.\nThe significance of this study lies in its exploration of the innovative PBLT approach and its potential impact on critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement among EFL learners. In the ever-evolving landscape of language instruction, the recognition that no single approach is flawless underscores the need for continuous exploration and refinement. Methods, including CLT and CLIL, have demonstrated effectiveness in specific skill development but may not holistically address the multifaceted nature of language acquisition.\nThe emergence of PBLT as a distinctive approach represents an opportunity to delve into its unique qualities, particularly in enhancing speaking and writing skills while concurrently fostering critical thinking abilities. Through the deliberate integration of philosophical questions and the establishment of a community of inquiry, PBLT engages learners in a cognitive process that extends beyond immediate linguistic contexts. The study seeks to unravel the significance of this approach in nurturing critical thinking skills, providing valuable insights into how language instruction can transcend traditional boundaries.\nMoreover, the examination of learner engagement within the context of PBLT extends beyond the surface of active participation to explore the intricate dimensions of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. By investigating these interconnected elements, the study aims to shed light on how PBLT creates a dynamic and stimulating classroom environment that encourages learners to direct their energy and effort toward achieving educational goals. This exploration is crucial in understanding the broader impact of PBLT on the motivation and commitment of EFL learners.\nFurthermore, the study's focus on academic achievement adds a crucial layer to the investigation, expanding beyond linguistic proficiency to encompass traditional measures of success such as course completion rates and performance in assessments. PBLT, as a dynamic approach, holds the potential not only to enhance language skills but also to contribute to the overall academic achievement of EFL learners.\nIn essence, this research aims to bridge a notable gap in the literature by providing a thorough examination of the consequences of philosophy-based language instruction on critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement. The findings of this study are anticipated to offer educators, policymakers, and researchers' valuable insights into the potential benefits and challenges associated with the integration of PBLT in EFL classrooms, contributing to the ongoing discourse on effective language instruction strategies and their broader educational implications.\nLiterature review\nTheoretical background\nPhilosophy-based Language instruction\nAccording to Vygotsky [17], elevated levels of thinking skills, particularly abstract thinking, can be attained through mediated tools like language. The specific type of language use conducive to knowledge discovery is dialogic question-and-answer interactions. In essence, it is the exploratory talk that engages learners in expanding their knowledge by experimenting with new ideas and receiving feedback from their interlocutor [18]. This contrasts with well-structured, pre-planned presentational speeches, especially in dialogues about fundamental philosophical matters. In this context, the term philosophy, in line with [19]'s paradigm, denotes small 'p' philosophy, aiming to assist learners in constructing a critical perspective on central life concepts rather than accepting everything exposed to them as absolute truth.\nThe tradition of dialogic philosophical questioning in education traces back to Socrates approximately 2500 years ago [20]. Drawing inspiration from Dewey's [21] concept of \"reflexive inquiry,\" [19] reinvigorated Socratic questioning by proposing the use of philosophy for children, primarily aiming to instill critical thinking skills in young learners. This involves establishing a community of inquiry (see, for example, [22]), where individuals actively engage in knowledge production through profound contemplation of various life issues, facilitated by the exchange of questions and answers [23]. Participants collaboratively construct and address their own philosophical questions based on specific input resources, fostering a sense of responsibility for their learning. Employing higher-order thinking skills in conjunction with cooperation, learners develop a social understanding of fundamental assumed beliefs and life concepts, subsequently enhancing their reasoning abilities and self-esteem [24]. Haynes [25] advocates for creating communities of inquiry in the classroom, asserting that children should be encouraged and provided opportunities to participate in society from an early age in meaningful contexts such as families, schools, and other settings where they have a stake.\nIt is crucial to underscore that philosophical dialogues within a community of inquiry diverge from ordinary conversations, where the focus is on participants' personal ideas. In contrast, in the former, the aim is to collectively construct ideas from peers' comments to address problems. The primary motivating factor for participants in a community of inquiry to sustain their discussions is the pursuit of truth, a dimension absents in casual conversations [26].\nWhile learners take the lead in classroom discussions and philosophical question-and-answer activities, it's crucial to note that the teacher is not passive; instead, they play an active role in guiding learners to clarify and simplify their ideas. However, the teacher refrains from dominating the discussion. The mediator appreciates learners' capabilities in knowledge creation and interpretation of reality embedded in the dialogues [27].\nCritical thinking\nThe theoretical underpinnings of critical thinking draw from various educational and philosophical perspectives, emphasizing the development of cognitive skills and the ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information. Scholars in the field of education have often turned to influential frameworks and models to conceptualize and understand critical thinking.\nOne prominent model is Bloom's Taxonomy of Cognitive Objectives, developed by Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues [28]. This taxonomy categorizes cognitive skills into a hierarchy, ranging from lower-order thinking skills (remembering, understanding) to higher-order thinking skills (applying, analyzing, evaluating, creating). Critical thinking is situated at the top of this hierarchy, emphasizing the ability to evaluate information and make reasoned judgments.\nAdditionally, the Paul-Elder Critical Thinking Framework, developed by Richard Paul and Linda Elder, provides a comprehensive model that identifies essential components of critical thinking, such as clarity, accuracy, relevance, and depth [29]. This framework encourages educators to guide learners in developing intellectual traits and habits associated with effective critical thinking.\nIn the realm of language education, scholars like Ennis have proposed specific dimensions of critical thinking relevant to language learners, including interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, explanation, and self-regulation [30]. These dimensions align with the cognitive processes involved in language comprehension, production, and analysis.\nFurthermore, philosophical perspectives, particularly those influenced by the Socratic method, have long been intertwined with the conceptualization of critical thinking. The Socratic method emphasizes questioning, dialogue, and reflective inquiry to stimulate critical thought and illuminate underlying assumptions.\nIn the context of PBLT, the works of Lipman and Sharp contribute to the theoretical foundation. Lipman's Philosophy for Children (P4C) approach advocates for integrating philosophy into education, fostering a community of inquiry where students engage in collaborative philosophical discussions [24].\nThis theoretical background demonstrates the multidimensional nature of critical thinking, drawing from educational models, philosophical traditions, and language education frameworks. The integration of these perspectives offers a comprehensive foundation for understanding and fostering critical thinking skills among learners.\nEngagement\nLearners' engagement is defined by the student's willingness to actively participate in daily school activities, such as attending class, completing assignments, and attentively listening to the teacher. A low level of classroom engagement can lead to adverse effects on both learning performance and the overall learning process [31]. In this context, [32] highlighted that student engagement results from effective classroom teaching and school development initiatives, signifying its increasingly crucial role [33]. underscored the importance of dynamic and collaborative learning, academic activities, effective communication with the teacher, and educational experiences within the realm of classroom engagement.\nLearners' engagement is a multifaceted construct that encompasses various cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dimensions within the educational context. Grounded in educational psychology, engagement is commonly defined as the extent to which students actively participate in and are committed to their learning experiences [34]. Fredricks, Blumenfeld, and Paris proposed a conceptual model that identifies three core components of student engagement: behavioral engagement, emotional engagement, and cognitive engagement [12]. Behavioral engagement involves participating in classroom activities and adhering to academic tasks, while emotional engagement pertains to the affective reactions and sentiments students associate with their learning. Cognitive engagement focuses on the investment of mental effort, active participation in complex cognitive tasks, and the application of higher-order thinking skills [12].\nSkinner and Belmont further emphasized the reciprocal relationship between teacher behavior and student engagement, highlighting the role of teachers in cultivating an environment conducive to sustained learner involvement [35]. Educational researchers have extended the scope of engagement to encompass not only academic activities within the classroom but also extracurricular pursuits and the broader school climate [36]. Mahoney, Cairns, and Farmer, for instance, identified extracurricular activity participation as a significant factor contributing to interpersonal competence and educational success [36].\nMoreover, Appleton, Christenson, and Furlong have drawn attention to the critical conceptual and methodological considerations associated with the construct of student engagement, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding that considers both its cognitive and affective dimensions [37]. Recognizing the dynamic interplay between various factors, including classroom dynamics, social interactions, and a sense of belonging, offers a comprehensive theoretical foundation for understanding and promoting learners' engagement in diverse educational settings [37].\nIn summary, the theoretical background of learners' engagement draws from foundational models like the one proposed by Fredricks, Blumenfeld, and Paris, which conceptualizes engagement as a multidimensional construct involving behavioral, emotional, and cognitive components. The reciprocal influence of teacher behavior, the impact of extracurricular activities, and the broader school climate further enrich our understanding of the complex dynamics that contribute to learners' engagement in educational contexts.\nAcademic and language achievement\nLanguage achievement is a nuanced and intricate concept reflecting an individual's competence and proficiency in a specific language [38]. It transcends mere knowledge of grammar and vocabulary, encompassing the ability to comprehend, utilize, and communicate effectively in both written and spoken forms. This process of achievement is dynamic, evolving over time, influenced by factors such as language exposure, formal instruction, learner motivation, and individual learning preferences [39]. It signifies an ongoing journey of improvement, where individuals strive to enhance their language skills through dedicated practice, immersion in authentic language contexts, and active engagement within language communities [40].\nThe assessment of language achievement is a multifaceted undertaking that encompasses a range of evaluation methods [41]. These methods include standardized language proficiency tests, performance assessments, and communicative tasks, which collectively provide a comprehensive appraisal of learners' language abilities. Standardized tests offer a structured and impartial means of assessing language proficiency across diverse dimensions, while performance assessments and communicative tasks shed light on learners' practical language application and communicative prowess. By integrating these assessment strategies, educators and researchers gain a holistic comprehension of learners' language achievement and the efficacy of language instructional approaches [42].\nEmpirical background\n[2] conducted an experimental study aiming to assess whether EFL students taught through the PBLT approach would surpass those instructed using traditional ESL methodologies in speaking skills and its components. The study involved 34 students from a prominent Iranian university, majoring in engineering, sciences, and humanities. All students were at an intermediate language level before the experiment. Randomly assigned to the experimental (N = 17) and control (N = 17) groups, the former received PBLT-driven EFL instruction, while the latter received conventional ESL methodologies. Results indicated that the experimental group outperformed the control group in speaking skills and related components (range, fluency, coherence, content), excluding accuracy. The authors attributed the lack of a significant difference in accuracy to PBLT's emphasis on meaning, whereas accuracy primarily pertains to linguistic form.\nAnother study investigating the efficacy of PBLT in the EFL classroom was carried out by [3]. Employing the same participants as in [2], the authors utilized a pretest-posttest experimental design to examine the impact of PBLT on the development of EFL students' productive skills (speaking and writing) as well as their critical thinking abilities. Their findings demonstrated that PBLT plays a crucial role in fostering the productive skills of EFL students by creating a conducive environment for discussion and negotiation. Additionally, they assert that the environment facilitated by PBLT has the potential to boost EFL students' motivation and cultivate positive attitudes toward the approach.\nIn a more recent study, [43] demonstrated that implementing the PBLT approach in the EFL classroom has the potential to enhance students' speaking skills and their willingness to communicate. The authors of the same study suggest that the observed efficacy of PBLT in improving speaking skills and fostering a willingness to speak indicates that PBLT could serve as an alternative approach to the traditionally employed IRF (Initiation-Response-Feedback) approach in teaching speaking skills.\n[44] aimed to assess P4C's impact on the critical thinking and English-speaking skills of 7th-grade gifted EFL students in T\u00fcrkiye. Employing a mixed methods research design, the study included randomly assigned experimental and control groups. Quantitative data were gathered through the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT) X level and the Cambridge English Speaking Test (A2 level for Schools), while qualitative data were obtained from reflective diaries and evaluation forms. The control group followed standard SAC English-speaking lessons, while the experimental group received English-speaking lessons based on the P4C approach. While both groups showed an increase in English-speaking skills, the difference was not statistically significant. However, there was a notable increase in critical-thinking skills for the experimental group, which was statistically significant. Qualitative feedback from the experimental group indicated positive effects of P4C practices on critical thinking and English-speaking skills, though the impact on English-speaking skills was not statistically significant.\nEducational philosophy encompasses systematic ideas and concepts within the educational domain [45]. aimed to investigate the impact of educational philosophy, critical thinking, and classroom engagement on academic achievement among pre-service teachers, utilizing structural equation modeling [45]. involved 444 teacher pre-service volunteers from a Turkish state university. Data were collected through the Educational Belief Scale, UF/EM\u00c4\u00b0 Critical Thinking Disposition Instrument, and Classroom Engagement Inventory. The analysis revealed that the hypothesized model explained 22% of the variance in academic achievement. Path coefficients demonstrated significant relationships between certain educational philosophies and critical thinking dispositions. Moreover, innovativeness in critical thinking disposition was a significant predictor for all dimensions of classroom engagement.\nThe emphasis on student engagement has gained prominence in higher education due to its positive association with learning outcomes. Despite its acknowledged importance, there is limited research on pedagogical methods that effectively enhance this engagement. In [46], a classroom scenario involving 33 students at a Chinese university was examined to investigate their interaction with a pedagogical approach integrating automated, peer, and teacher feedback on academic writing. Through the analysis of multiple drafts, feedback sources, and retrospective interviews, the study found that the majority of students actively participated in this integrated approach, fostering behavioral, affective, and cognitive engagement and facilitating thoughtful revisions.\nAmid the global repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, online classes have garnered considerable attention. In language learning, the teacher-student relationship assumes a pivotal role, especially in online settings where student engagement holds paramount importance [47]. investigated the relationship between structured feedback and three types of engagement--cognitive, behavioral, and emotional--in an online class. The study encompassed 114 EFL third-year college students, and the results revealed positive and significant correlations between the utilization of structured feedback and all three types of engagement. The structured feedback, administered at the conclusion of each lesson, empowers students to articulate their knowledge, queries, and insights. This underscored the significance of effective feedback strategies in enhancing engagement within online language learning environments.\n[48] investigated the potential mediation of students' motivational beliefs in the association between teacher-student relationships and foreign language achievement. The study involved 1171 eighth graders in China. Results indicated a positive correlation between teacher-student relationships and foreign language achievement, with intrinsic and extrinsic motivation serving as partial mediators. Notably, intrinsic motivation played a more substantial mediating role compared to extrinsic motivation. In summary, nurturing teacher-student relationships can elevate learners' foreign language proficiency by cultivating motivation, with intrinsic motivation being particularly influential.\n[49] provided essential insights derived from a systematic literature review concentrating on the influence of teaching assistants or similar roles on pupils' academic performance. The review assessed measurements before and after teacher support interventions. The amalgamation of findings reveals that primary school students with identified learning difficulties, particularly in literacy, experience substantial academic improvement with targeted teacher support. However, studies involving more general teacher support, not specifically directed at pupils with identified difficulties, yield varied outcomes. This suggests that teacher support in mainstream classes may not universally enhance the academic achievements of all students.\nThe studies reviewed offer valuable insights into the efficacy of PBLT and related pedagogical approaches in enhancing language skills, critical thinking, and learner engagement [2] and [3]. demonstrate the superiority of PBLT over traditional ESL methodologies in fostering speaking skills, critical thinking, and learner motivation among EFL students, suggesting its potential as a transformative approach in language education. Similarly, [43] highlights the positive impact of PBLT on speaking skills and willingness to communicate, emphasizing its role as an alternative to conventional instructional methods. Additionally, [44] provides evidence of the effectiveness of P4C practices in enhancing critical thinking among EFL students, further underscoring the value of philosophy-driven methodologies in language instruction. These findings collectively contribute to the ongoing discourse on effective language teaching methodologies and underscore the importance of integrating philosophical inquiries into language education to promote holistic learner development.\nThe existing literature on PBLT has laid a strong foundation for the current study by highlighting the potential benefits of integrating philosophical inquiries into language instruction. Previous research has underscored the positive impact of PBLT on critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement among EFL learners. The research questions addressed in this study are crucial as they aim to provide empirical evidence to further substantiate these claims and offer insights into the specific mechanisms through which PBLT influences learners' cognitive and academic outcomes. By examining the effects of PBLT on critical thinking skills, learner engagement, and academic achievement, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on effective language teaching methodologies and informs educators and policymakers about the importance of incorporating philosophy-based approaches into language instruction.\nDespite the diverse landscape of language instruction approaches, such as CLT, CLIL, and more recently, PBLT, there exists a critical gap in the current literature regarding the specific impact of PBLT on critical thinking, learner engagement, and academic achievement among EFL learners. While existing studies acknowledge the efficacy of PBLT in enhancing speaking and writing skills, the literature lacks comprehensive investigations into its influence on critical thinking processes and overall engagement. The integration of philosophical questions and the establishment of a community of inquiry within PBLT have shown promise in fostering cognitive processes beyond linguistic contexts. Therefore, this study seeks to address this research gap and provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and challenges associated with the integration of PBLT in EFL classrooms, contributing to the ongoing discourse on effective language instruction strategies and their broader educational implications. The study aims to explore three key dimensions: the effect of PBLT on critical thinking skills, its impact on learner engagement, and its role in shaping overall academic achievement within the EFL context.",
        "methodology": "Method\nDesign\nThis study employed a concurrent mixed-methods research design, seeking to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of PBLT's impact on critical thinking, learner engagement, and academic achievement among EFL learners. The concurrent design involved the simultaneous collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data to offer a holistic perspective on the research questions. The quantitative phase utilized a teacher-made test to quantitatively measure PBLT's effect on academic achievement. Simultaneously, the qualitative phase employed interviews, focus group discussions, and reflective diaries to gather in-depth insights into participants' experiences and perceptions regarding the integration of PBLT. The concurrent mixed-methods approach ensured a robust exploration of the complex interplay between PBLT and the targeted outcomes, allowing for a comprehensive interpretation of the findings and enhancing the overall validity and reliability of the study.\nThe selection of a concurrent mixed-methods design for this study is justified by the need to comprehensively explore the multifaceted impact of PBLT on EFL learners. By combining both qualitative and quantitative approaches concurrently, this design allows for a more holistic understanding of the complex interplay between PBLT, critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement. While quantitative measures provide numerical data to assess academic outcomes, qualitative insights from interviews and document analysis offer nuanced perspectives on learners' experiences and cognitive processes. This integrated approach enhances the depth and richness of the study findings, providing a more robust foundation for informing language teaching practices and policymaking decisions.\nThe study was conducted in a university setting in Bangladesh, involving a total of 75 learners who were enrolled in intact classes. These learners were divided into two groups: an EG consisting of 38 learners and a CG with 37 learners with the same gender distribution. All participants were identified as intermediate EFL learners based on the results of the Oxford Quick Placement Test. The learners, aged between 18 and 26, shared Bengali as their native language and were learning English as their second language. Notably, none of the participants had prior experience visiting an English-speaking country before the commencement of the study. This homogeneous participant profile ensured consistency in language proficiency levels and background characteristics, contributing to the internal validity of the research findings. It is important to consider that in education settings, it is almost impossible to have a random selection of participants, therefore language researchers mostly resort to intact and preexisting classes [50]. However, it might also hamper the generalizability of the findings [50].\nThe selection criteria for participants in this study involved targeting EFL learners from similar educational backgrounds and language proficiency levels to ensure comparability between the experimental and control groups. Participants were recruited based on their enrollment in language courses that followed either a PBLT or traditional instructional approach. Additionally, efforts were made to ensure demographic diversity within the participant pool to enhance the generalizability of the findings.\nInstrument\nThe study employed a comprehensive set of instruments to measure various dimensions of learners' outcomes. Semi-structured interviews, adopted from [45, 47], were utilized to explore in-depth insights into learners' critical thinking and engagement. This qualitative approach allowed for a nuanced understanding of the participants' experiences and perspectives following the PBLT intervention.\nDocumentary analysis was conducted to complement the qualitative data, aiming to triangulate findings related to critical thinking and engagement. This involved the examination of relevant documents, records, or artifacts that could provide additional context and evidence of changes in learners' cognitive and participatory behaviors.\nTo assess language achievement, a teacher-made test (See Additional File 1) was administered, consisting of fill-in-the-blanks, multiple-choice, short-answer, and open-ended questions. The test's face and content validity were confirmed by two Ph.D. holders in Applied Linguistics, ensuring that the items effectively measured the intended constructs. Additionally, the construct validity was established through the known-group technique [50], further substantiating the test's ability to differentiate between groups with varying proficiency levels. To be more specific, we implemented the test a group of language teachers whose performance turned out to be significantly different from out participants at the outset of the study (p >.05), hence the construct validity of the instrument.\nReliability analysis was conducted using the KR-21 formula, resulting in a high-reliability coefficient (r =.823). This indicated consistency and dependability in the test scores, enhancing the robustness of the instrument for measuring language achievement. The careful validation and reliability procedures contribute to the overall trustworthiness and validity of the study's findings.\nData collection procedures\nIn this study, the EG received PBLT, while the CG received traditional language instruction. The PBLT sessions were designed to integrate philosophical questioning and the establishment of a community of inquiry within the EFL classroom.\nPBLT sessions were conducted over a specific timeframe, with each session lasting approximately 90 min. The EG, comprising 38 learners, participated in a total of 12 PBLT sessions conducted twice a week for six weeks. The sessions were facilitated by the instructor, emphasizing collaborative dialogue, exploration of philosophical questions, and engagement in critical thinking activities.\nIn PBLT, the instructor initiated discussions by posing open-ended philosophical questions relevant to the learners' language proficiency level. These questions were carefully crafted to stimulate higher-order thinking skills, encourage reflection, and prompt meaningful discourse. Learners actively engaged in discussions, sharing their perspectives, questioning assumptions, and collectively constructing knowledge within the community of inquiry.\nThe PBLT approach also involved collaborative activities, where learners worked together to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information related to the philosophical inquiries. The process aimed to extend learners' cognitive engagement beyond the immediate linguistic context, fostering a deeper understanding of language use in connection with critical thinking.\nThe PBLT sessions in the study were characterized by a dynamic and interactive learning environment that encouraged learners to engage deeply with language concepts through philosophical inquiries. Specific examples of philosophical questions used included queries about the nature of truth, the ethical implications of certain actions, and the meaning of identity. These questions prompted learners to critically analyze language usage in various contexts and consider multiple perspectives, fostering their critical thinking skills. Collaborative activities within the PBLT sessions involved group discussions, debates, and collaborative projects where learners worked together to explore language and philosophical concepts. For instance, learners might engage in a debate about the ethical implications of a hypothetical scenario or collaborate on a project to create a philosophical dialogue in the target language.\nConversely, the CG, consisting of 37 learners, received traditional language instruction, focusing on established methodologies without the incorporation of philosophical questioning or the community of inquiry approach. The traditional instruction encompassed language learning activities commonly found in conventional EFL classrooms, emphasizing grammar exercises, vocabulary drills, and communicative tasks.\nIn traditional language instruction for the control group, the focus was primarily on rote learning and mastering predefined language patterns. Learners engaged in activities such as grammar drills, vocabulary exercises, and structured dialogues aimed at practicing language forms and rules. Content typically revolved around textbook passages, dialogues, and exercises designed to reinforce grammar rules and vocabulary usage. Activities included completing fill-in-the-blank exercises, translating sentences, and practicing scripted dialogues. The instructional approach was teacher-centered, with the instructor delivering explanations, modeling language usage, and providing corrective feedback. Classroom interactions were often structured around the Initiation-Response-Feedback model, where the teacher posed questions, students responded, and the teacher provided feedback. Overall, the emphasis was on linguistic accuracy and mastery of prescribed language patterns, with limited opportunities for open-ended discussion, critical inquiry, or collaborative exploration of language concepts.\nBy contrasting the outcomes of the EG and CG, the study aimed to assess the specific impact of PBLT on critical thinking, engagement, and language achievement among EFL learners in the university setting. The careful design and implementation of PBLT sessions allowed for a focused examination of the innovative approach's efficacy in comparison to traditional language instruction methods.\nThe data collection procedures for this study involved a comprehensive approach, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods to gather information on critical thinking, engagement, and language achievement among the study participants.\nIndividual semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants from both the EG and the CG. These interviews aimed to explore learners' experiences, perceptions, and reflections on critical thinking and engagement after exposure to philosophy-based language teaching (PBLT). The interviews were audio-recorded with participants' consent and subsequently transcribed verbatim for qualitative analysis.\nA documentary analysis was conducted to complement the interview data. Relevant documents, such as written reflections, class notes, and artifacts, were collected from all participants in both the EG and CG. This additional source of data provided context and depth to the understanding of changes in critical thinking and engagement throughout the study.\nTo assess language achievement, a comprehensive teacher-made test was administered to all learners from both groups.

Our study suggests that a more inquiry-based and collaborative approach, inspired by philosophy, can be integrated into existing language curricula. Syllabus designers may consider creating spaces for dialogic interactions, community of inquiry activities, and opportunities for learners to explore language within broader philosophical contexts. This shift in syllabus design encourages a more holistic view of language learning, emphasizing the interconnectedness of language instruction with critical thinking development.\nPolicy-makers in the field of education can consider the implications of our study when formulating guidelines and recommendations for language teaching methodologies. The positive impact of PBLT on critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement suggests the potential benefits of incorporating such approaches into broader educational policies. Policy initiatives may focus on providing professional development opportunities for teachers to integrate PBLT strategies, allocating resources for the development of materials aligned with philosophical inquiries, and encouraging a pedagogical shift towards more interactive and collaborative language learning environments. Our findings provide a basis for policy-makers to explore innovative and research-based approaches to language education, fostering a culture of critical thinking and active engagement among EFL learners.",

        "introduction": "Many students feel uncomfortable when obliged to communicate in English. Students' fear of speaking English is influenced by psychological reasons such as the fear of failing, being misunderstood, and making grammatical errors. Students' active participation in English class discussions might be hindered by shyness, nervousness, lack of confidence, and motivation. Helping these reserved students gain self-assurance and perfect their spoken English is a top priority for all English language instructors. In the classroom, teachers may use some simple methods to encourage their reserved students to open up and speak English with more ease and confidence. The existing literature on students' shyness shows that the gap in this realm is great and a critical look is needed. To this end, the current research intended to gauge the effects of self-esteem, teacher support, and critical thinking on anxiety and shyness in language classes. 385 language learners attending English language institutions took part in this research. They were at intermediate and upper intermediate levels. The findings of both confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) point to the fact that improving students' self-esteem, teacher support, and critical thinking may have a moderating effect on students 'anxiety and shyness in language learning. The implications of this inquiry may be advantageous for language learners, language instructors, as well as policymakers.\nKeywords: Self-esteem, Teacher support, Critical thinking, Anxiety, Shyness, EFL learners\nAuthor(s): Lei Li1 and Tahereh Heydarnejad2\nOverview\nThroughout the process of their academic journey, multiple learners have encountered some adverse events that might potentially impede their progress in acquiring a foreign language. Language learners may find speaking and writing to be more demanding and tough since they need to use their skills to produce spoken or written communications. Over the years, there have been several improvements in the techniques and methods used to teach speaking and writing in order to make the learning process simpler. As a result, despite numerous obstacles, some students are able to overcome them and persevere in their attempts to learn and utilize a second language. However, some students may struggle to overcome hurdles, perhaps leading to the development of foreign language anxiety (FLA). FLA is a condition that is marked by the experiencing of negative emotions, such as unease, anxiety, and nervousness, when engaging in tasks such as listening, writing, reading, and speaking in a language that is not one's native tongue.\nAccording to the definition provided by [1], anxiety refers to a phenomenon that is peculiar to a particular setting, when a person has a negative evaluation of their own communication skills within the framework of language acquisition. The research conducted by [2, 3] suggests that anxiety in language learning may be categorized into three different components. The aforementioned components include communication apprehension, exam anxiety, and the concern of receiving poor evaluations. The concept of \"communication apprehension\" pertains to the anxiety experienced by pupils while interacting with people or encountering challenges in comprehending auditory information. The subsequent element of anxiety in the context of language acquisition is often referred to as test anxiety, which manifests when students have apprehension around their anticipated performance on an examination.\nAn EFL student who suffers from a phobia of negative assessment is one who intentionally avoids circumstances that have the potential to result in the formation of unfavorable judgments in the perceptions of other people, and who is uncomfortable with the perspectives that are held by other people. Similar research by [3] found that students' personality traits (introversion vs. extroversion) significantly impact the degree to which they worry about failing their foreign language classes. In accordance with [4], students' anxiety affects their classroom performance in ways that contribute to their development and progression. The Attentional Control Theory (ACT) offers an explanation for anxiety and its negative consequences, as proposed by [5]. Anxious students, according to the ACT, report high levels of worry and low levels of self-confidence, both of which are associated with poor outcomes [6, 7].\nThe consequences of skill-based anxiety in second/foreign language learning have also been studied in recent studies. The studies looked at many forms of communication anxiety, such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing [8, 9]. Research results presented previously indicate that students' lack of motivation and poor performance may be traced back to their fear of public speaking, writing, reading, and listening. Recent research by [10, 11] found that students' ability to feel academically buoyant and control their emotions helped them deal with their nervousness during language learning.\nShyness is considered to be one of the personality traits that might contribute to anxiety while speaking a foreign language. This is mostly due to the fact that shyness tends to be more evident in social situations that include communication, particularly when people are speaking a language that is not their native tongue. In the words of [12], a shy person is typically fearful, has a tendency to talk less, and experiences uncomfortable feelings when communicating with others or when in unfamiliar situations. [13] defined two forms of shyness: frightened shyness and self-conscious shyness. As described by [14, 15], terrified shyness is a sort of shyness that emerges when a person interacts with other individuals. The person's knowledge that he or she is an integral part of a community that has the ability to assess the individual is a cause of the second sort of shyness.\nDiverse constructs attributable to the learner can assist students in reducing potential shyness and anxiety in language classes and ensuring their well-being. The construct of self-esteem, which has been extensively investigated within the field of education, pertains to an individual's subjective evaluation of their own worth or value [16]. Possessing elevated self-esteem is crucial for fostering healthy mental health and overall well-being. Having a high level of self-esteem is beneficial as it enables individuals to cultivate effective coping mechanisms, effectively navigate through challenging situations, and have a balanced viewpoint towards adverse experiences [17]. The classification of self-esteem is based on three levels: expanded, substantial, and inadequate self-esteem [18]. People with elevated self-esteem consistently see themselves as superior to others and engage in the practice of diminishing the capabilities of others. However, those who possess a high level of self-esteem tend to have a propensity for self-love and self-acceptance via placing faith in their own capabilities. On the contrary, those characterized by a diminished degree of se lack confidence in their own talents and exhibit doubt over their capacity to successfully complete a given activity.\nThe significance of self-esteem in EFL settings is highly emphasized owing to the distinctive characteristics of L2 education, as highlighted by [19]. According to [20], self-esteem refers to an individual's belief in their own abilities and worth. [21] suggest that the construct being examined is derived from an individual's subjective evaluations of their own talents, competencies, and social relationships. In the words of [22], self-esteem is closely connected to the process of self-evaluation, which encompasses cognitive evaluations that play a vital role in an individual's perception of their own value and mental well-being. Following its establishment within the existing body of literature on the interplay between psycho-emotional factors and EFL settings, numerous studies have been undertaken to explore the relationship between self-esteem, optimistic feelings, academic drive, nervousness, accomplishment, retention, adaptability, and related variables [21].\nIn addition, EFL scholars have gone a step further over the past decade to investigate how students' confidence affects their language skills and academic outcomes in areas like oral communication, written expression, reading comprehension, and listening [23]. In a similar line of inquiry, [24] reached the conclusion that structural elicitation plays a mediating role in the process of developing advanced and intermediate language learners' speaking skills. The results of the research showed that students of another language who were able to demonstrate greater levels of self-esteem fared better on oral examinations when they were given in mixed groups. Evidence was discovered by [25, 26] to support the hypothesis that teachers who demonstrate good social and emotional skills to their students play an essential role in the students' personal growth in these areas.\nTeacher support (TS) can also be critical in learners' mental and psychological success. TS includes educators' empathy, compassion, commitment, reliability, and warmth for their pupils [27]. On the basis of Tardy's [28] social support paradigm, the wide viewpoint defines TS as the act of a teacher providing informational, instrumental, emotional, or appraisal assistance to a student, regardless of the setting in which the student is located. Supportive instructors respect and are passionate about in developing personal ties with their students, and they may provide aid, assistance, and guidance to pupils in need [29]. Effective assistance from the instructor is probably to make students feel comfortable and inspired, which will motivate them to put extra work into the course of study, become more involved in educational endeavors, and accomplish greater educational results [30]. TS is a complex concept that has been interpreted in a variety of ways. There are three components of TS that are central to the self-determination approach: encouragement of self-determination, commitment for engagement, and encouragement for regulation [31]. TS for their pupils may be broken down into four categories from an interpersonal standpoint: informative, essential, scrutiny, and emotional [32].\nResearch findings have indicated a significant positive relationship between TS and various dimensions of student engagement, including behavioral, cognitive, and emotional aspects. Furthermore, it should be noted that teacher support has the potential to indirectly impact students' academic engagement by fostering good accomplishment emotions and mitigating negative success emotions [27, 31]. Previous research has mostly focused on investigating teacher assistance in the context of general education [32], with minimal emphasis placed on its impact on students' acquisition of a second language. Furthermore, it should be noted that teacher support has the potential to indirectly impact students' academic engagement by fostering good accomplishment emotions and mitigating negative success emotions [33].\nPrevious research has mostly focused on investigating teacher assistance in the context of general education [32], with minimal emphasis placed on its impact on students' acquisition of a second language. The significance of the teacher as a crucial source of positive reinforcement for learners in language courses has been recognized through the interpersonal character of language instruction and frequent communication between teachers and students [33]. Therefore, it is imperative to delve deeper into the exploration of teacher support as a fundamental factor associated with teachers [34].\nAs described by [35], CT is a process of continually assessing hypotheses in order to draw inferences about the world. [36] uses the phrase \"reflective practices\" to define critical thinking, which establishes a logical bridge between initial assumptions and well-grounded conclusions. The American Philosophical Association offers a definitive definition of CT by describing it as the process of making informed, self-controlled decisions by the use of evidence, reasoning, and logic [37]. Despite the fact that there is no universally accepted definition of CT, a large amount of research demonstrates the importance of CT in many walks of life, notably in accomplishing academic goals [38, 39]. Students are in need to have an understanding of how to employ CT techniques in the classroom in order to learn, as [40] argued.\nMoreover, [41] highlighted the central importance of CT in this debate by highlighting its ability to transform inactive participants into active questioners. Teachers, as the, are accountable for teaching and practicing deep understanding, yet CT is not a natural talent [42]. With these considerations in mind, the study of critical thinking and its beneficial impacts on academic success in EFL contexts (among many others) is a fruitful area in which to engage in educational inquiry. [43], for example, have examined the value of creating a model for instructing critical thinking in the EFL classroom. They came to the conclusion that students who are able to think critically are better equipped to develop their own methods of reflective learning. According to the findings of another research by [44], if EFL instructors acquire sufficient understanding about critical thinking, they will be able to use it in their own classes. Comparable reasons for the failure to properly deploy CT in EFL classrooms were cited by [39, 44], who pointed to EFL instructors' limited comprehension of CT and the discrepancy between teachers' positive sentiments regarding CT and their actual classroom actions.\nWith these considerations in mind, the study of critical thinking and its beneficial impacts on academic success in EFL contexts (among many others) is a fruitful area in which to engage in educational inquiry.

Literature reviews reveal that students experience CT in various ways. CT also has a considerable impact on how students form their sense of self [48]. Moreover, [49] found that using CT enhanced both reading comprehension and language acquisition. EFL students with higher CT scores performed better in writing tasks, as shown by [50]. It was also concluded that CT boosted students' ability to learn via exploration [51-53].\nThis study\nGiven the substantial impact of the constructs mentioned above in facilitating the acquisition of a foreign language, as well as the limited amount of research investigating their interconnections, the main aim of this study was to investigate the influence of self-esteem, TS, and CT on reducing shyness and anxiety in the context of English as a Foreign Language in Iran. Drawing upon relevant academic literature and theoretical frameworks, a conceptual framework was developed to visually represent the dynamic interplay of the aforementioned elements. The proposed model (Fig. 1) was next subjected to CFA and SEM, which are both extensively used statistical methods for evaluating the construct validity of latent variables and the relationships among multiple variables, respectively. In order to accomplish the goals of the study, the researchers developed the following research inquiries:\nRQ1\nTo what extent does the development of self-esteem skills among EFL learners help to the reduction of shyness and anxiety?\nRQ2\nTo what extent does the development of teacher support among EFL learners help to the reduction of shyness and anxiety?\nRQ3\nTo what extent does the development of critical thinking skills among EFL learners help to the reduction of shyness and anxiety?\nIn light of the aforementioned research inquiries, the subsequent null hypotheses were put forth:\nHO1\nThe development of self-esteem skills among EFL learners does not help to the reduction of shyness and anxiety.\nHO2\nThe development of teacher support among EFL learners does not help to the reduction of shyness and anxiety.\nHO3\nThe development of critical thinking among EFL learners does not help to the reduction of shyness and anxiety.\nFig. 1:\nThe suggested model",
        "methodology": "Methodology\nContext and participants\nThere was a total of 385 students who took part in the study, with men making up 33% of the group and women the other 68.47%. All respondents were Iranian pursuing English learning in private language institutions (Mashhad, northeast of Iran); their ages varied from 16 to 19 with a median of 17. The survey was conducted in English since respondents were proficient enough in the language (upper and intermediate levels) to answer questions in the intended language. Those who were interested in taking part completed an electronic permission form and sent it to the study's organizers. The researchers made it very apparent that taking part in the study was entirely optional and that individuals might stop participating at any moment. Researchers also promised participants that their comments would be kept secret and that they would be updated on the study's findings. It is worth mentioning that the studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Review Committee at Private Language Institutions in Mashhad (Approval No. 29/213,087/2 M).\nInstruments\nThe Foreign Language Learning Self-esteem Scale (FLLSE) was used in order to investigate the levels of self-esteem held by university students studying EFL. Using a Likert scale with five points, this tool was designed by [18]. The scale ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The FLLSE is comprised of a total of 25 questions, which are broken down into four categories: (1) language competence (e.g., \"I possess a high level of comprehension in the English language.\"), (2) actual in-class language use (e.g., \"I am available to participate in any English classroom activities as a volunteer.\"), (3) in-class correlations (e.g., \"I participate in English classroom activities with reluctance.\"), and (4) attitude toward behavior (e.g., \"I am not well-liked by my English classmates.\"). In this particular investigation, the dependability of this instrument was evaluated, and the result of the Cronbach alpha coefficient was found to be satisfactory ([alpha] = 0.851).\nIn order to conduct an evaluation of teacher support, [26], Teacher Support Measure (TSM) with two subsections was used. These subsections included four items each for teacher academic support and teacher personal support. On a Likert scale of five points, each item was given a score ranging from 1 (always) to 5 (never). For the purpose of evaluating subject-specific teacher assistance, these questions have been revised with the addition of the word \"English.\" Cronbach's alpha indicated that the reliability of this scale was satisfactory (with scores ranging from 0.811 to 0.892.\nCT was evaluated using the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal Form A (WGCTAF) by [54], who were studying university students' CT. This measure is broken up into five categories: inference, identifying assumptions, making deductions, interpretation, and assessment. Each category has a total of 32 questions. Cronbach's alpha was determined to be adequate in this investigation ([alpha] = 0.865), as reported.\nTo determine the degree of shyness among the participants the McCroskey Shyness Scale (MSS) [55] was applied. The participants were asked to rate how much they agreed or disagreed with each of 14 statements (e.g., I keep thinking that the other students are better at languages than I am.) on a 5-point scale, with 1 being a strong disagreement and 5 representing a strong agreement. The study's results were corroborated by Cronbach's alpha, which suggested that the reliability of this scale was good ([alpha] = 0.876).\nThe Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS), which was developed and validated by [2], was used in an investigation of the degree to which university students suffer anxiety when studying a foreign language. The 33 questions on this scale, which uses a Likert scale with five points (range from strongly agree to strongly disagree), were chosen to evaluate communication anxiety, fear of unfavorable evaluation, exam anxiety, and anxiety associated with learning a foreign language. Cronbach's alpha indicated that the reliability of the FLCAS was satisfactory (with scores ranging from 0.833 to 0.862), and this was supported by the findings of the study.",
        "analysis": "Data collection and analysis\nIn 2023, researchers conducted the data collection procedure. Online forms (specifically Google Forms) were used to collect the data. This online survey has five sections: the FLLSE, TSM, WGCTAF, MSS, and FLCAS. As a result of the fact that the participants had the requisite qualifications to respond to the text in English, the scales were written in the target language, and translation was not required. Due to the rigorous preparation of the computerized survey, there would have been little likelihood of any data being lost. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was first used to look at the data distribution. Data screening confirmed the normality of the data, demonstrating the reliability of parametric methods. Given the assumption of normal distribution in the data, CFA and SEM were conducted using LISREL 8.80. CFA is a statistical method used to validate the component structure of a given collection of observed data. Additionally, CFA enables researchers to examine if there is a connection between observable variables and the latent constructs that underlie them [56, 57].",
        "results": "Results\nThis part provides an exposition of the findings derived from the data analysis, with comprehensive elucidations for each constituent element. The first phase (Table 1) entails the analysis of descriptive data about the different elements of each instrument.\nTable 1:\nDescriptive statistics\nUpon considering self-esteem, the prevailing course of action was seeking out Attitude toward Behavior in the Class of Foreign Language, with a mean score of 23.600 and a standard deviation of 6.062. Upon deconstructing the major factors of the TS scale, it was shown that Teacher Personal Support had the highest average value (M = 14.395, SD = 3.684) compared to the other core variables within the scale. The variable of Recognizing Assumptions had the highest level of significance in relation to CT. The average score on the fourth instrument, Shyness, was 35.584, with a standard deviation of 11.406. Moreover, Fear of Negative Evaluation exhibited a mean score of 30.161, accompanied by a standard deviation of 9.603.\nThe data was then subjected to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in order to identify any anomalous patterns. The results are shown in Table 2.\nTable 2:\nThe results of kolmogorov smirnov test\nBased on the data shown in Table 2, the values of all instruments and their respective components are above the threshold of 0.05. As a result of this observation, it may be inferred that parametric approaches are appropriate for the analysis of the data.\nIn this study, the link between self-esteem, TS, CT, shyness, and anxiety are examined using a Pearson product-moment correlation analysis.\nTable 3:\nThe correlation coefficients between the self-esteem, TS, CT, shyness, and anxiety\nReferring to Table 3, the association between self-esteem, shyness, and anxiety subcomponents were negative. The variables of shyness (r = -0.834), communication anxiety (r = -0.794), fear of negative evaluation (r = -0.782), test anxiety (r = -0.713), and anxiety of foreign language class (r = -0.743) demonstrated a significant correlation. Furthermore, it was shown that there were statistically significant negative relationships between TS, shyness, and anxiety subcomponents. The variables examined in this study were shyness (r = -0.940), communication anxiety (r = -0.883), fear of negative evaluation (r = -0.877), test anxiety (r = -0.846), and anxiety of foreign language class (r = -0.908). Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation observed between the subcomponents of anxiety, shyness, and CT. Specifically, the correlations were as follows: shyness (r = -0.563), communication anxiety (r = -0.645), fear of negative evaluation (r = -0.679), test anxiety (r = -0.609), and anxiety of foreign language class (r = -0.655).\nThe results are shown in Table 4, which demonstrates that all of the fitness levels for Model 1 fall within the permissible thresholds. The aforementioned values consist of the chi-square/df ratio (2.958), the root-mean-squared error of approximation (RMSEA) (0.071), the goodness-of-fit (GFI) (0.947), the goodness-of-fit (NFI) (0.938), and the comparative fit index (CFI) (0.962).\nTable 4:\nModel fit indices\nIn addition, Table 4 provides further evidence that the chi-square/df ratio (2.994), the RMSEA (0.072), the GFI (0.956), the NFI (0.961), and the CFI (0.978) all meet the criteria for a satisfactory fit with respect to Model 2.\nFig. 2:\nThe symbolic representation of the values of the path coefficients (Model 1)\nFig. 3:\nT values for path coefficient significance (Model 1)\nTable 5:\nSummary of the findings in Model 1\nThe visual representation of the relationship among the components is shown in Figs. 2 and 3, as well as in Table 5. The standardized estimates and t-values indicate a significant correlation between self-esteem and shyness ([beta] = -0.80, t = -22.76), as well as between TS and shyness ([beta] = -0.93, t = -31.12). Furthermore, the relationship between CT and shyness ([beta] = -0.54, t = -8.23) was found to be negative. Similarly, negative relationships were seen between self-esteem and anxiety ([beta] = -0.74, t = -17.65), TS and anxiety ([beta] = -0.86, t = -25.12), as well as CT and anxiety ([beta] = -0.62, t = -12.23).\nFig. 4:\nThe symbolic representation of the values of the path coefficients (Model 2)\nFig. 5:\nT values for path coefficient significance (Model 2)\nTable 6:\nSummary of the findings in Model 6\nThe detailed relationships among the subscales are illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5 as well as Table 6.\nThe results indicate a significant and unfavorable correlation between the subsequent factors: Self-esteem and shyness ([beta]= -0.80, t= -22.43), TS and shyness ([beta]= -0.93, t= -30.74), as well as CT and shyness ([beta]= -0.54, t= -7.76).

        "limitations": "Conclusion and pedagogical implications\nIn brief, this study set out to examine the potential relationships that exist among self-esteem, TS, and CT to shyness and anxiety at tertiary institutions. In this study, a model hypothesis is generated and tested using structural equation modeling and factor analysis. The findings show that self-esteem, TS, and CT have substantial effects on EFL students' positive attitudes and academic success. The acquired results supported the suggested model, validating the predictive abilities of self-esteem, TS, and CT to shyness and anxiety. The extent to which EFL students engaged in self-esteem and CT as well as teacher support influenced not only their willingness to communicate but also their academic achievement.\nIn order to ensure that self-esteem, TS, and CT are successfully implemented, it is imperative that professors and other instructors at schools, universities, and private institutions take an active role in the development and upkeep of an atmosphere that is receptive to such an endeavor. They are required to learn the information essential to cultivate self-esteem, TS, and CT inside their respective courses. EFL teachers can get these strategies from courses taken both during training and prior to employment. Moreover, it is crucial to include actionable techniques for cultivating and implementing self-esteem, TS, and CT within the context of EFL instruction. In order to give sufficient opportunities for learners to gain the necessary skills and to grantee the whole education and society, appropriate activities and materials should be designed. An effective method of providing support to EFL students is by promoting the development of a growth mindset. This will aid learners in discovering a clear and meaningful objective, while also strengthening their feeling of inclusion and connection. The individuals will have both immediate and enduring objectives to strive for, and each accomplishment will be seen as a significant triumph.\nStudents are expected to advance toward a condition in which the application of appropriate procedures will become natural, and the capabilities of learning will grow into an intuitive form, via the completion of a range of tasks in the classroom. It was highly suggested that those charged with building educational curriculum, developing educational policy, and generating new materials take into consideration the important impacts of self-esteem and CT when they are creating new materials and tasks. EFL students at schools, institutions, and universities may, in addition to other types of academic work, participate in activities that put practical ways for increasing the impacts of self-esteem and CT into practice. These activities may include things like simulations, role-playing games, discovery learning activities, and oral presentations. The provision of additional open conversation channels with the subject matter of self-esteem, TS, and CT, as well as the management of shyness and anxiety at the upper intermediate level, may be an additional beneficial chance to strengthen these abilities and practice their language.\nBased on the findings of this study, EFL educators are urged to redesign their curricula and create assessments with the students' needs in mind. Encouraging students to take an active part in their own education, as well as directing and improving the development of self-help structures, may improve the quality of teaching and assessment in any educational setting. Increasing their proficiency in digital media is a priority for both students and teachers. With this knowledge in hand, both students and teachers may feel secure throughout language instruction and assessment.\nThe present research, similar to earlier investigations, has numerous limitations: (1) This investigation was carried out using quantitative analytic methods. Using mixed-method approaches provides for a more in-depth look, and they are avenues that may be pursued for future study. (2) As previously stated, it is critical for EFL teachers to play a role in the development of self-esteem, CT, and other self-aid constructs in their pupils. This element was not taken into consideration throughout our study. Further research may be able to investigate how teachers' own levels of self-esteem and CT impact students' self-esteem and CT. (3) The learners' diverse backgrounds, as well as their demographic data, were not taken into consideration in this study. These difficulties may be addressed in future study, and it may be studied to what extent differences in sociocultural environment and demographic information may have an influence on the nature of the link between self-esteem, TS, CT, shyness, and anxiety. (4) Inclusion of students from other faculties and institutions would aid in gaining an overview of the outcomes. This inquiry may be carried out in diverse educational situations, including as schools and private language institutions, in the course of future research. (5) In future research, possible investigators may choose to focus on the relationship between self-esteem, TS, CT, shyness, anxiety and other learner-ascribed traits including buoyancy, grit tendencies, readiness to speak, and identity construction/reconstruction.\nAbbreviations: EFL: English as a Foreign Language; CFA: Confirmatory Factor Analysis; SEM: Structural Equation Modeling; FLA: Foreign Language Anxiety; ACT: Attentional Control Theory; TS: Teacher Support; CT: Critical Thinking; FLLSE: The Foreign Language Learning Self-esteem Scale; TSM: Teacher Support Measure; WGCTAF: The Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal Form A; MSS: The McCroskey Shyness Scale; FLCAS: The Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale; RMSEA: The Root-Mean-Squared Error of Approximation; GFI: The Goodness-of-fit; NFI: The Goodness-of-fit; CFI: The Comparative Fit Index\nAcknowledgements: Not applicable.\nCorrespondence:\nAuthor details: 1 https://ror.org/02rkvz144, grid.27446.33, 0000 0004 1789 9163, School of History and Culture, Northeast Normal University, , 130024, Changchun, People's Republic of China. 2 https://ror.org/0161hbt42, grid.510437.4, 0000 0004 7425 0053, Department of English Language, Faculty of Literature and Humanities, University of Gonabad, , Gonabad, Iran.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe primary objective of this research was to examine the correlation between self-esteem, TS, and CT with shyness and anxiety in language courses within an EFL environment. Consequently, a model was constructed and assessed using SEM to illustrate the interrelationships among these components in this study. The results indicate that self-esteem, TS, and CT strongly influenced the levels of shyness and anxiety experienced by students in language lessons. The mediating effects of self-esteem, TS, and CT are emphasized and discussed below in relation to the connections shown in Models 1 and 2.\nThe first inquiry was to ascertain the degree to which the elevated levels of self-esteem among EFL students influenced the reduction of shyness and anxiety in language lessons. The findings revealed that pupils with higher self-esteem levels felt lesser shyness and anxiety. The theoretical implications of this discovery might be debated. The idea of self-esteem is supported theoretically by both self-determination theory and self-identity theory [16, 18]. EFL leaners may benefit from self-esteem both directly and indirectly since it helps them develop a good sense of self, which in turn fosters positive attitudes about schoolwork and evaluations. The favorable effect of self-esteem on shyness and anxiety, which are fundamental ideas in the field of EFL, is consistent with the results of [58], who came to a similar conclusion.\nA positive self-concept, which is a result of self-esteem, assists language learners in cultivating robust cognitive, metacognitive, and problem-solving abilities. This conclusion aligns with the fundamental principles of social-cognitive theory [55], which emphasize the need of students actively monitoring and assessing their own performance and making necessary modifications to optimize their efficacy. The self-determination theory proposed by [59] states that an increase in an individual's level of self-awareness results in improvements in that person's levels of motivation, satisfaction, and social participation.\nWith regard to the second research question, it was found that EFL students who perceived high levels of TS felt more confident and less shy. The acquisition of a foreign language is often facilitated inside a classroom setting, when learners are supported by teachers and their peers. This particular circumstance might elicit feelings of worry, particularly among those who possess introverted tendencies, since they harbor apprehensions of potential unfavorable challenges. Through the process of identifying these learners, educators may get an understanding of the specific sort of motivation that drives their engagement with EFL learning. Additionally, educators can assess the extent to which these learners are inclined to engage in communicative activities, and subsequently, tailor instructional techniques that align with their individual learning requirements [60].\nBased on an analysis of students' personality traits, such as shyness, and their level of readiness to speak, an educator may assess their engagement in classroom activities and then adapt the curriculum as needed. For instance, in the event that a greater number of introverted students exhibit hesitancy in participating actively during classroom discussions, it may be beneficial to allocate a greater proportion of the curriculum to pair work or solo tasks. This approach aims to provide a learning environment that minimizes the perceived risks associated with public speaking. This finding is supported by the outcomes of [61, 62]. They discovered a positive correlation between the level of shyness and the level of fear of language class anxiety, such that an increase in shyness is accompanied by an increase in class anxiety, and conversely, a decrease in shyness is accompanied by a decrease in class anxiety.\nThe third purpose of this research was to determine whether introverted and anxious feelings diminished in EFL students who used CT. According to the results, students may better safeguard and increase their chances of success by strengthening their conceptual and metacognitive abilities. The results of the second model show that CT significantly declined shyness and anxiety components. To restate, CT directs EFL students in their assessments of the value of the university and their sense of belonging there, as well as in their convictions regarding the efficacy of their language classes. Students are highly encouraged to actively participate in class debates and other speaking exercises, since they are an essential component of any language education [15, 57].\nThis conclusion is logical when one takes into account the fact that students perceptions broaden as they acquire proficiency in language abilities. The CT of EFL students has a significant role in shaping their feeling of identity and academic success. As students actively participate in CT techniques, they increasingly undergo beneficial transformations in their attitudes and beliefs. The researchers [40, 44, 49] reached identical findings. They have shown that there is a correlation between the ability to participate in advanced cognitive processes, self-control, interpersonal skills, and belief in one's own abilities.",

        "introduction": "We constructed and tested a moderated mediation model to explore the influence of critical thinking on creativity by examining the mediating role of creative self-efficacy (CSE) and the moderating role of perceived school support for creativity (PSSC) in this relationship. The sample comprised 413 Chinese college students who completed a survey at two time points. The empirical analysis results showed that college students' critical thinking was positively related to their creativity. Further, the CSE of college students partially mediated the positive relationship between critical thinking and creativity. In addition, PSSC positively moderated the relationships between critical thinking, CSE, and creativity, that is, when the PSSC of college students was higher, the promotion effect of critical thinking on CSE was enhanced, ultimately promoting creativity. These conclusions enrich the relevant literature on critical thinking, CSE, PSSC, and creativity, and also provide suggestions for the higher education field on how to improve the creativity of college students.\nKeywords critical thinking, perceived school support for creativity, creative self-efficacy, creativity, college students\nArticle Highlights\n* College students' critical thinking was found to be positively related to their creativity.\n* The creative self-efficacy of college students partially mediated the positive relationship between critical thinking and creativity.\n* Perceived school support for creativity positively moderated the relationships between critical thinking, creative self-efficacy, and creativity.\nCritical thinking has been widely recognized as an indispensable cognitive skill in the 21st century (Karahan & iskifoglu, 2020). The study of individual critical thinking has received extensive attention in many fields, such as education, management, philosophy, and psychology (Mao et al., 2022). From a pedagogical perspective, critical thinking is a method to encourage students to actively question and challenge norms, which may lead to critical actions that change the status quo (Tsai, 2019). Numerous studies have established that critical thinking is associated with positive cognitive outcomes (Shin, 1998), and may improve the willingness, ability, and attitude of college students to participate in creative activities (Qiang et al., 2020). Creativity refers to the novel and practical ideas or concepts that individuals build on existing products, processes, and services in a particular organization (Zhou & Hoever, 2014). College students' creativity is affected by individual factors, such as personality traits, thinking ability, motivation, and emotion (Wang et al., 2022). However, the relationship between the critical thinking and creativity of college students has not been fully revealed, especially in the Chinese context.\nThe component theory of creativity (Amabile, 1988) emphasizes that task motivation, domain-relevant skills, and creativity-relevant processes are the three key components that affect individual creativity. As one of the main components of individual motivation, creative self-efficacy (CSE) is also an important internal process influencing individual creativity (Tierney & Farmer, 2011). Hence, we introduced CSE as a mediator of the relationship between critical thinking and creativity. A supportive environment directly affects an individual's intrinsic motivation to be creative, and individual creativity is the result of the interaction between individual characteristics and organizational context (Woodman et al., 1993). For college students, when their perceived school support for creativity (PSSC; i.e., their subjective perception of the degree to which their college recognizes, supports, and encourages their creativity) is high, they usually have higher positive expectations and confidence in the success of innovation (Ma, 2009), and ultimately exhibit higher creativity. Therefore, we believed that PSSC would moderate the relationships between critical thinking, CSE, and creativity. Taken together, the proposed conceptual model is shown in Figure 1.\nCritical Thinking and Creativity\nIt is well-known that creativity begins with identifying a problem (Felin & Zenger, 2014). Only by truly recognizing the problem can we put forward valuable questions that are derived from critical reflection on and analysis of the current situation (Facione, 1990). That is to say, college students with good critical thinking skills are more likely to bypass traditional thinking, view book knowledge critically, and be unwilling to blindly follow the authority of experts (Huber & Kuncel, 2016). This allows them to break out of a fixed mindset; propose, evaluate, and execute creative ideas (Meng & Zhao, 2018); and ultimately promote their creativity. College students with critical-thinking skills habitually use critical perspectives to analyze and solve problems (Chan, 2013), question unreasonable conventions, and strengthen their interest in their own work (Drake & Reid, 2018). Many previous studies have confirmed that if individuals are interested in what they are doing, they generally have a high level of creativity (Niu, 2007; Woodman et al., 1993). Hence, we posited the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: Critical thinking will be positively related to creativity.\nThe Mediating Role of Creative Self-Efficacy\nIn terms of the factors influencing CSE, we believed that critical thinking would play a positive role in promoting the CSE of college students. Specifically, an important characteristic of college students' critical thinking is their confidence in the reasoning process, that is, in their rational analysis ability (Shin, 1998). They usually believe that they can make reasonable judgments and be trusted by others (D'Alessio et al., 2019), which enhances their confidence in the creative process and improves their CSE. Besides, college students with critical-thinking skills usually enjoy exploring knowledge and seeking truth (Huber & Kuncel, 2016), which manifests as having the courage to question, deny, and surpass traditional knowledge or theories; the courage to persist and challenge in the face of difficulties (Tsai, 2019); and the perseverance to complete creative work. In such processes, college students are endowed with a sense of efficacy and their CSE may be continuously strengthened. Therefore, we posited the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2: Creative self-efficacy will play a mediating role in the relationship between critical thinking and creativity.\nThe Moderating Role of Perceived School Support for Creativity\nAccording to the componential theory of creativity, a supportive environment is an important factor for the development of individual creativity (Amabile, 1988). Perceived school support for creativity forms a situational support factor in the process of college students' cognitive adjustment (Lubans et al., 2011), and then enhances the positive impact of critical thinking on CSE and creativity. For college students with a high level of critical thinking, the more creativity support they perceive from their school, the better is their psychological expectation of creative results, so that they are more convinced of their ability and more willing to carry out creative activities, thus promoting CSE and creativity. Taken together, we posited the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 3: Perceived school support for creativity will moderate the relationship between critical thinking and creative self-efficacy.\nHypothesis 4: Perceived school support for creativity will moderate the mediating effect of creative self-efficacy on the relationship between critical thinking and creativity.",
        "methodology": "Method\nProcedure\nWe adopted a survey design to test the research hypotheses and theoretical model. Considering our resource limitations, we used random sampling to select 500 students from a general research college in Beijing, China. We assured the students that the survey results would be used for academic research purposes only and kept strictly confidential. In addition, we followed Podsakoff et al.'s (2003) suggestion to collect the data at two time points to reduce the likelihood of common method variance. At Time 1 students reported their critical thinking, PSSC, and demographic information (including gender, age, and grade). One month later, students rated their CSE and creativity at Time 2. All participants provided informed consent to take part in the study. We also received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of Capital Normal University (CNU00120221222003).\nParticipants\nAfter matching and cleaning up the data, the final sample consisted of 413 students, yielding a response rate of 82.6%. Among them, 190 (46.0%) were men and 223 (54.0%) were women, aged between 17 and 21 years (M = 19.08, SD =1.23). Regarding grade level, there were 121 freshmen (29.3%), 139 sophomores (33.6%), 111 juniors (26.9%), and 42 seniors (10.2%).\nMeasures\nItems were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. We translated the scales into Chinese using back-translation.\nCritical Thinking\nWe measured critical thinking using Jiang and Yang's (2015) five-item scale, which was developed from the research of Facione (1990) and has been validated in the Chinese context (Qian et al., 2017). A sample item is \"I often try to find alternative solutions to a problem.\" Cronbach's alpha in this study was .83.\nPerceived School Support for Creativity\nWe measured PSSC using Amabile's (1988) eight-item scale, which has been verified for use in the cultural background of Chinese colleges by Chang et al. (2016). A sample item is \"I was often encouraged to solve problems creatively.\" Cronbach's alpha in this study was .90.\nCreative Self-Efficacy\nWe measured CSE using Tierney and Farmer's (2011) three-item scale, which is a simplified cross-cultural version of the original scale and has been validated by Gu et al. (2017) with a sample of Chinese college students. A sample item is \"I'm pretty good at generating new ideas.\" Cronbach's alpha in this study was .76.\nCreativity\nWe measured creativity using Tierney et al.'s (1999) six-item scale, which is based on Amabile's (1988) definition of creativity and has been validated with Chinese samples (Meng & Zhao, 2018). A sample item is \"I often come up with new perspectives on research problems.\" Cronbach's alpha in this study was .88.\nControl Variables\nNumerous studies have suggested that the gender, age, and grade of college students can affect their creativity and perception of school support (e.g., Chang et al., 2016; Lubans et al., 2011). Hence, we controlled for these variables in testing the proposed theoretical model. Gender was coded as 1 = male and 2 = female. Grade was divided into four levels: 1 = freshmen, 2 = sophomores, 3 = juniors, and 4 = seniors.",
        "analysis": "Preliminary Analyses\nBefore testing the hypotheses we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis with Amos 22.0. As the results show, the baseline four-factor model fitted the data well, chi-square/degrees of freedom ratio = 2.25 (ideal fit < 3), comparative fit index = .95 (ideal fit > .90), goodness-of-fit index = .91 (ideal fit > .90), root mean square error of approximation = .06 (ideal fit < .08), standardized root mean square residual = .07 (ideal fit < .08), and the fit was significantly better than that of the three-factor, two-factor, and one-factor models. These results provided evidence for the distinctiveness of the four core variables.\nIn addition, since we collected data through self-reporting (Conway & Lance, 2010), there was a risk of common method variance (CMV). During the data-collection stage the students were informed that the results would remain anonymous, and we reverse coded some items and used Harman's single-factor test (Podsakoff et al., 2003) to assess CMV. The test results indicated that the first factor in the exploratory factor analysis explained only 36.59% of the variance (ideal fit < 40%); thus, there was no significant CMV in our study.\nThe means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations among the four core variables are presented in Table 1. The focal variables were significantly related to one another.\nHypothesis Testing\nTable 2 reports the hierarchical regression results for the main study variables. As shown in Model 5, after controlling for gender, age, and grade, critical thinking was positively correlated with creativity, supporting Hypothesis 1.\nFor the mediating role of CSE, Model 6 in Table 2 shows that after CSE was added to the regression analysis model of critical thinking on creativity, both CSE and critical thinking were positively correlated with creativity. Therefore, the CSE of college students played a partial mediating role in the relationship between critical thinking and creativity, supporting Hypothesis 2.\nFor the moderating role of PSSC, after controlling for gender, age, and grade, critical thinking was positively associated with CSE (Model 2). The interaction term of critical thinking and PSSC was also significantly related to CSE (Model 3). Furthermore, we adopted Cohen et al.'s (2003) suggestion to plot this interaction as a conditional value of PSSC (M [+ or -] 1 SD), which is depicted in Figure 2. As shown, the strength of the positive link between critical thinking and CSE increased when PSSC was high (simple slope = .45, p < .01), but not when PSSC was low (simple slope = .05, p < .01). Thus, Hypothesis 3 was supported.\nFinally, we employed a bootstrapping analysis (Hayes, 2015) with the PROCESS macro (Model 7) to test the moderating role of PSSC in influencing the indirect effect of critical thinking on creativity via CSE. The results revealed that the influence of PSSC on the moderated mediation effect was significant, [beta] = .07, SE = 0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.02, 0.09]. Further, the mediating effect of CSE on the critical thinking-creativity relationship became stronger when PSSC was high, [beta] = .06, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [0.01, 0.13], but not when PSSC was low, [beta] = .01, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.05]. In other words, PSSC positively moderated the mediating effect of CSE in the relationship between critical thinking and creativity. Taken together, Hypothesis 4 and the whole model were fully supported.",

        "discussion": "Discussion\nUsing a two-time-point data collection method with a sample of Chinese college students, we found that critical thinking is positively correlated with creativity, and that this positive correlation is partially mediated by CSE. Furthermore, the PSSC of college students moderates both the positive correlation between critical thinking and CSE, and the mediating effect of CSE on the relationship between critical thinking and creativity.\nTheoretical and Practical Implications\nFor theoretical implications, we first confirmed that the critical thinking of college students has a positive influence on their creativity. This result not only effectively promotes the development of critical thinking theory in the field of educational psychology (Qiang et al., 2020), but also further enriches understanding of creativity theory as it relates to college students (Jiang & Yang, 2015; Ma, 2009). Second, we introduced CSE as a mediating variable to explain the internal influence process of critical thinking on creativity, which provides new evidence that the CSE of college students is an important mediating factor in the relationship between their individual characteristics and creativity (Puente-Diaz, 2016), and further enriches the literature on self-efficacy theory in the field of education (Peach et al., 2007). Finally, we verified that the PSSC of college students plays a moderating role in the relationships between their critical thinking, CSE, and creativity, which broadens understanding of the boundary condition of these relationships (Ma, 2009) and contributes to the literature on school support theory (Qiang et al., 2020).\nIn practice, critical thinking has always been seen as an important part of the education platform. In view of this, we have practical suggestions for how to effectively promote the creativity of college students. First, colleges should recognize and commend the efforts made by faculty members in the cultivation of college students' critical thinking, and advocate for and build the teaching culture and atmosphere to facilitate this process. Second, teachers, as the group that has the most contact with college students in the context of higher education, should pay close attention to changes in students' self-efficacy and use various methods to provide psychological intervention and counseling to improve their self-efficacy. In addition, when evaluating college students, it is necessary to change the traditional way of judging grades based on grades alone by instead focusing on their professional ability and comprehensive quality.\nLimitations and Directions for Future Research\nFirst, all variables were measured through self-reporting. Future research would benefit from measuring variables at different times from different sources. Second, the sample comprised students from only one university in Beijing, China, which may limit the extent to which the conclusions are applicable to other cultures or countries. Future scholars could use samples from diverse organizational settings under different cultural backgrounds to investigate the generalizability of the proposed theoretical model. Third, we constructed and confirmed a moderated mediation model to discuss the mediating role of CSE and the moderating role of PSSC in the relationship between critical thinking and creativity. However, other variables could explain or modulate this relationship. Thus, future researchers could go further by incorporating other mediating or moderating variables, such as positive emotions, knowledge sharing, intrinsic motivation, and mindfulness.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (21CMZ040).\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available on request from the corresponding author.",

        "introduction": "Background\nAnxiety and depression often co-occur during adolescence, but the associations between symptoms of these two disorders in this developmental period are not yet fully understood. Network analysis provides a valuable approach to uncover meaningful associations among symptoms and offers insights for prevention and intervention strategies. This study aimed to investigate symptom-level associations between anxiety and depression using network analysis and to identify core symptoms, bridge symptoms, and differences in network structure across different stages of adolescence.\nBackground\nAdolescence is a period of rapid development and change, as well as a time of frequent mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression, the two most common psychological problems reported during this developmental period [1, 2]. Co-occurrence of the two is referred to as comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD), which can increase treatment difficulty, length of illness duration, worsen prognosis and recovery, and increase rates of disability and suicide compared to the existence of a single disorder [3-5]. According to recent meta-analysis studies by Zhang et al. [6] and Yu et al. [7], the prevalence of anxiety ranges from 26.3 to 27%, while the prevalence of depression ranges from 24 to 28%. Meanwhile, among individuals experiencing anxiety or depression, the prevalence of current or lifetime CAD is reported to range from 10 to 75% [8, 9], indicating that a substantial proportion of adolescents experience both anxiety and depression. Given the adverse consequences and high prevalence of CAD, it is essential to carry out research with the potential to enhance our knowledge of it during this developmental period, thereby promoting public health initiatives in mental health promotion and early prevention.\nBoth the latent variable model and the network model are used to study CAD [10], offering different perspectives on symptoms and their relationships. The former considers symptoms as mere reflective indicators of underlying diseases and disregards any potential interaction among the symptoms themselves [10, 11]. However, empirical evidence suggests that this theoretical stance does not adequately align with reality [12]. For instance, persistent low mood may result in insomnia, subsequently leading to difficulties in maintaining focus during the day and increased irritability in social activities. Psychopathology network theory provides a more nuanced conceptualization of this issue by shifting the perspective to view symptoms as a causal system. According to this theory, symptoms not only indicate but also contribute to the disorder itself. It is the symptoms, along with their interactions, that effectively constitute the disorder [13, 14]. Thus, comorbidity naturally arises from the interconnected of symptom networks [10]. Moving beyond the mere calculation of total symptom scores to evaluate disease severity, network theory offers a deeper understanding of the importance of individual symptoms in the progression of the disorder.\nIndeed, several studies have utilized dynamic symptom interaction networks to explore mental disorders, where symptoms are represented as \"nodes\" and inter-symptom correlations as \"edges\" [13]. Some studies in children and adolescents have identified core symptoms and global strength as important characteristics of CAD through network analysis. Core symptoms refer to those that are strongly connected to other symptoms within the network [15]; global strength of a network measures the overall connectivity, with stronger connectivity indicating greater vulnerability and susceptibility to mental disorders [16]. In previous research, McElroy et al. [14] found that \"anxious/fearful\" and \"unhappy/sad\" were the core symptoms during the developmental stage of 5-14 years old and observed an increasing trend in the global strength of the network. However, bridge symptoms, which connect symptoms of different disorders [17], were not examined in their study. In another study on CAD conducted by Cai et al. [18] focusing on late adolescence, \"sad mood\" and \"worry too much\" were also identified as core symptoms. Additionally, \"irritability\" and \"guilty\" were core symptoms as well. The study further identified \"guilty,\" \"sad mood,\" and \"suicide ideation\" as bridge symptoms [18]. However, there is a research gap in fully exploring the comprehensive set of core and bridge symptoms of CAD in the specific developmental stage of adolescence.\nAdditionally, previous studies have extensively documented the dynamic developmental patterns of anxiety and depression in adolescence, but limited research has specifically focused on understanding the changes that CAD may undergo during this developmental period. For example, McLaughlin and King [19] found that anxiety severity, as measured by the average total score, decreased across adolescence, while depression severity remained stable. Using the tripartite model of CAD, Conway et al. [20] documented that negative affect and anxious arousal dimensions showed a decline over time, whereas the anhedonia dimension did not. McElroy et al. [14] conducted a network analysis study on individuals from ages 5 to 14 and found that symptoms within the CAD network were highly interconnected, and the node strength (an indicator of core symptoms) exhibited developmental variations in this age period.\nTherefore, it remains crucial to investigate whether the distinct symptoms of CAD also undergo changes throughout the specific period of adolescence, utilizing network analysis. Network analysis can provide valuable insights by investigating bridge symptoms and core symptoms, as well as evaluating changes in global strength over time. By intervening on bridge and core symptoms to mitigate their mutual influence and prioritizing the allocation of healthcare resources to groups with higher global symptom strength, we can potentially enhance the effectiveness of public health initiatives [17, 21, 22].\nBuilding upon the evolving understanding of the comorbidity of anxiety and depression during adolescence, we hypothesize that the network structure of CAD also differs across developmental stages. Based on previous research among Chinese adolescents [23, 24], the transition from early to late adolescence is marked by changes in school contexts, with significant shifts in academic routines and expectations, school environments, and social groups and relationships. Consistent with this past research, we categorized age into distinct developmental stages: early adolescence (10-12 years), middle adolescence (13-15 years), and late adolescence (16-18 years). The goal of our study is to use network analysis to capture characteristics of CAD and compare symptom-level susceptibility to comorbidity across stages of adolescence. Specifically, we will (1) identify bridge symptoms and core symptoms within the CAD network and (2) compare the network structures across the three stages of adolescence. By accomplishing these objectives, we aim to gain insights into the distinctive features of CAD and examine how its network evolves during different stages of adolescence.",
        "methodology": "Methods\nThe cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2022 in Shenzhen, China. Participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale, along with demographic questionnaires assessing age and gender. Chinese adolescents aged 10 to 17 who were in Grades 5 or 6 of elementary school, Grades 1 or 2 of middle school, or Grades 1 or 2 of high school, and who could comprehensively understand and read Chinese were recruited as participants. Students in Grade 3 of middle and high schools were excluded due to their upcoming high school or college entrance examinations. Based on age, participants were categorized into early, middle, and late developmental stages of adolescence.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThis study utilized data from a large-scale sampling survey conducted in March 2021 in Shenzhen, one of China's economically developed cities. The survey, carried out in cooperation with the Educational Science Research Institute of Shenzhen, targeted students aged 10 to 17 in local public elementary, middle, and high schools across all districts of Shenzhen. Inclusion criteria included: (1) students enrolled in Grade 5 or 6 of elementary school or Grade 1 or 2 of middle school or high school; and (2) students with proficiency in Chinese reading and comprehension. Exclusion criteria included students in Grade 3 in middle and high school due to their upcoming high school or college entrance examinations, which may hinder their availability for the survey. Ethical approval was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of Shenzhen University, and it conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration (approval number: 2,020,005). All participants and their parents were informed about the content and aims of the study, and informed consent was obtained from the legal guardians of all enrolled students.\nProcedure\nTo facilitate data collection, an online survey questionnaire was imported into the Wenjuanxing platform, a Chinese online survey platform (https://www.wjx.cn/). The survey's background, purpose, and informed consent were explained on the first page of the questionnaire. The survey was completed online by the students as a class unit in the school computer room during a school day, under the supervision and instruction of a teacher or school staff. The questionnaire took approximately 20 min to complete.\nMeasures\nAnxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), an effective screening instrument for anxiety symptoms [25]. The scale assesses seven typical symptoms of anxiety disorders using a 4-point scale (none = 0; a few days = 1; more than half time = 2; almost every day = 3), with higher scores representing greater severity of anxiety symptoms in the past two weeks. Total scores can range from 0 to 21 [25]. The Chinese version of the GAD-7 has demonstrated good reliability and validity in Chinese adolescents [26].\nDepressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9), which is directly based on the nine DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder and is particularly well-validated for use in primary care settings [27]. Each item corresponds to a symptom of depression, rated on a 4-point scale (none = 0; a few days = 1; more than half time = 2; almost every day = 3). Higher scores on the PHQ-9 indicate greater severity of depressive symptoms experienced in the past two weeks, with scores ranging from 0 to 27 [27]. The Chinese version of the PHQ-9 has demonstrated good reliability in the Chinese adolescent population [28].",
        "analysis": "Statistical analyses\nWe employed jamovi 2.3.26 for descriptive statistics and two-tailed independent t-tests [29], and R 4.0.2 for constructing network structures for CAD in adolescence [30], including network estimation, network stability, and network differences [31]. A threshold score of 10 or higher on both the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 is used to identify comorbidity [25, 31]. The network analysis followed the standard guidelines for network analysis, which included network estimation and visualization, centrality estimation, network stability, and accuracy estimation [32]. Additionally, we conducted a comparison of network structures based on the approach outlined by Van Borkulo et al. [33].\nNetwork estimation and visualization\nAll models were visualized as network graphs, with \"nodes\" representing items from anxiety and depression scales, and \"edges\" representing the conditional dependence relationship (i.e., regularized partial correlations) between the \"nodes\" [34]. The R packages \"bootnet\" and \"qgraph\" were used to estimate and construct visual network graphs [32].\nDue to the positively skewed distribution of the data, we employed a transformation to convert the data into binary format, based on the criterion of \"absence or presence of symptoms.\" Scores of \"0\" were coded as the absence of symptoms and scores \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" were coded as the presence of symptoms. The Ising model was then used to estimate the network structure for the binary data [33]. This model encompasses two sets of parameters: threshold parameters, which indicate whether a variable is endorsed (assigned a value of 1) or not (assigned a value of 0), and pairwise association parameters, which represent the strength of the statistical associations (logistic regression coefficients) between the variables [35]. However, estimating a large number of pairwise association parameters can potentially introduce false-positive edges into the network that does not actually exist [34]. To address this issue, we employed the eLASSO procedure in the IsingFit R-package, as outlined in Epskamp et al.'s 2018 tutorial [32], which incorporates a penalty approach based on the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) with a gamma ([gamma]) value of 0.25. This approach retains only the most significant associations between variables in the network while controlling for false-positive edges.\nNetwork centrality\nSymptoms that exhibit strong associations with other symptoms within a disorder are identified as core symptoms, while symptoms that are connected to two psychiatric disorders are referred to as bridge symptoms [36-38]. The centrality of nodes is used to determine whether the symptoms can be categorized as core symptoms. We used the R package \"qgraph\" to compute the centrality indices of nodes within the network [32]. Additionally, the R package \"networkTools\" was utilized to compute nodes' bridge centrality to identify bridge symptoms [37]. The three most common used centrality statistics are strength, closeness, and betweenness [17], and the three most common bridge statistics are bridge strength, bridge betweenness, and bridge closeness [37]. However, betweenness and closeness are unstable and indirect and therefore not suitable in the context of symptom networks for mental disorders [38]. As a result, strength and bridge strength were selected as the nodal attributes to be assessed in the current study. Strength represents the sum of the absolute edge weights of a node, representing how well the node is directly connected to other notes [32]. The nodes with node strengths significantly higher than those of other nodes are identified as core symptoms [25]. Bridge strength is defined as the sum of all edges that connect a node to symptoms of another disorder, indicating the node's total connectivity with other disorders [17, 38]. Symptoms corresponding to nodes with bridge strengths in the top 20% are identified as bridge symptoms [17].\nNetwork accuracy and stability estimation\nWe conducted post-hoc stability analyses to assess the stability and accuracy of both edge weights and centrality parameters by using the bootnet R-package [32]. Firstly, we evaluated the accuracy of edge weights by computing their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) through nonparametric bootstrapping (bootstrap samples = 1000). Secondly, following the approach described by Epskamp et al. [32], we assessed the stability of node centrality by calculating the correlation stability (CS) coefficient using a case-dropping subset (bootstrapped samples = 1000). This involved comparing the correlation of centrality indices (such as strength) between the original sample and a randomly selected subset that excluded 70% of the data. To be considered stable, a centrality index should not significantly differ in the subset sample. Stability was measured using CS coefficients, with a recommended threshold of 0.5, but no less than 0.25 [32]. Thirdly, we utilized the non-parametric bootstrap method to examine whether there were significant differences between each pair of centrality estimations for edges or nodes (bootstrapped samples = 1000, [alpha] = 0.05).\nNetwork comparison\nIsing network models estimated for three adolescence stages were compared using the \"Network Comparison Test\" (NCT) R package [33]. The comparison was performed with 1000 iterations of a permutation test. NCT assessed differences between two networks in two aspects: (i) global strength, which represents the summed edge-weights of the networks, and (ii) structural invariance, which examines statistically significant changes in relations between variables and nodes. Considering that this study mainly focuses on exploring stage susceptibility, only global strength differences were calculated. Global differences in networks were measured by the Global Strength between two networks, which is the weighted absolute sum of all edges in the network [15, 35].\nNetwork analysis\nNetwork estimation and visualization\nThe anxiety and depression comorbidity networks for early, middle, and late adolescence are shown in Fig. 1. The networks illustrate clusters of anxiety and depression symptoms that are interconnected. Among the 120 possible node pairs, 107 node pairs were associated in early adolescence, 106 node pairs in middle adolescence, and 100 node pairs in late adolescence. In all three stages of adolescence, the highest edge weights were between GAD2 (loss of control) and GAD3 (excessive worry) in anxiety symptoms and between PHQ1 (anhedonia) and PHQ4 (fatigue) in depression symptoms.\nFig. 1:\nNetwork of anxiety and depression comorbidity in three developmental stages.

Figure S2 displays the findings of the Subsetting Bootstrap analysis, revealing that the stability coefficients (CS-Coefficient) for node strength were consistently high across all three stages of adolescence, with a value of 0.75. Additionally, the CS-Coefficient for node bridge strength was above the recommended threshold of 0.5 in all three stages, with values of 0.67, 0.59, and 0.52. These results suggest that both the nodes and edges of the network exhibit high stability and accuracy.\nNetwork comparison test\nThe global strengths of the three networks were 47.68, 48.14, and 48.91, with significant differences between the early and middle stages, and the early and late stages, and no significant differences between the middle and late stages (early vs. middle: diff = 0.46, p = 0.04; early vs. late: diff = 1.23, p = 0.03; middle vs. late: diff = 0.77, p = 0.15).",

The global strength of the network in middle adolescence was significantly higher compared to the other two stages.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nA total of 78,428 questionnaires were collected from 135 schools. After excluding invalid questionnaires that were not submitted within the allotted time, contained unidentifiable information, or had excessive repetitive responses, the data from 68,425 valid questionnaires was considered suitable for inclusion in the analyses. Among the 68,425 participants, there were 30,160 individuals in early adolescence (11.47 [+ or -] 0.64 years old; male percentage: 53.11%), 28,841 in middle adolescence (13.60 [+ or -] 0.72 years old; male percentage: 52.00%), and 9,424 in late adolescence (16.32 [+ or -] 0.47 years old; male percentage: 48.12%). The detailed number of individuals by age can be found in Table 1.\nTable 1:\nParticipant characteristics, overall and stratified by gender, age and developmental stage\nReliability and validity measures\nTo assess the internal consistency of the measures used in this study, Cronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to evaluate the construct validity of the measurement model. As presented in Table 2, the Cronbach's alpha values ranged from 0.908 to 0.944, indicating good internal consistency for each of the constructs. CFA also confirmed the good construct validity of the scales at each stage of adolescence.\nTable 2:\nScale reliability and validity\nDescriptive statistics\nThe mean anxiety scores across all three developmental stages fall within the \"Minimal Anxiety\" range of symptom levels [25]. Sample means for depression in the early and middle adolescence stages also fall within the \"Minimal Depression\" range, while the sample mean for depression during the late adolescence stage falls within the \"Mild\" range of symptom levels [27]. Results for anxiety and depression scores, as well as comorbidity prevalence rates across three developmental stages, are shown in Table 3, and symptom detection ratios for each stage are shown in Appendix Table S1.\nTable 3:\nPrevalence and severity of anxiety and depression in three developmental stages\nIn addition, there were significant differences between the anxiety and depression scores at all developmental stages (t-test, p < 0.001 ). There was no significant difference in comorbidity rates between the middle and late adolescence stages (t-test, p = 0.15 ); however, the early adolescence stage had a significantly lower comorbidity rate compared to the other two stages (t-test, p < 0.001 ).",
        "limitations": "Conclusion\nThese findings highlight the core and bridge symptoms that require special attention and intervention at each stage of adolescence. Moreover, significantly higher network connectivity in middle adolescence suggests this is a critical period for intervention to prevent the development of comorbid mental disorders.\nKeywords: Adolescence, Anxiety, Depression, Comorbidity, Network analysis\nAuthor(s): Yunhan He1,2 , Chengrui Wu3,4 , Joelle LeMoult5 , Jiasheng Huang6 , Yue Zhao1,2 , Kaixin Liang7 , Shiyun Chen4 , Enna Wang8 , Liuyue Huang7 and Xinli Chi1,2\nLimitations and future research\nThere are several limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, although network theory implies a causal account of the evolution of psychiatric syndromes [36], the cross-sectional nature of our data prevents us from revealing causal dynamics, especially in relation to the direction of relationships between anxiety and depression symptoms [5, 66]. As mentioned before, future longitudinal studies are needed to explore the activation of symptoms over time and provide insights into the causal relationships between symptoms [67].\nSecondly, our study only included DSM-5 symptoms of anxiety and depression, while non-DSM-5 symptoms may also play a significant role in symptom networks [68]. Hence, including a more comprehensive set of symptoms and scales in future studies would provide a more nuanced understanding of the networks. Besides, it is important to acknowledge that symptoms from other disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders [69, 70], may co-occur with anxiety and depression. Future research should consider incorporating these common adolescent mental health problems and their symptoms into network analyses to identify pivotal symptoms for prevention and intervention efforts.\nFurthermore, the sample used in this study consisted of adolescents from a school setting, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to the broader community or clinical populations. Variations in network connectivity across different samples or populations have been observed in prior research. Therefore, caution should be exercised when extending the results to clinical settings, and it would be valuable to include clinical samples in future investigations to determine the consistency or discrepancies in the conclusions.\nLastly, considering cultural differences, it is important to note that the manifestation of emotions as somatic symptoms may more normally present in collectivist societies [71]. While our study focused on a specific cultural context, further research is needed to verify the results in non-collectivist countries and explore the influence of cultural factors on symptom networks.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the current study characterized the comorbidity of anxiety and depression network within a large Chinese adolescent sample by employing network analysis. Through the examination of network structures, we identified core symptoms (e.g., \"loss of control,\" \"excessive worry,\" \"anhedonia,\" and \"restlessness\") and bridge symptoms (e.g., \"anhedonia,\" \"sad mood,\" and \"fatigue\") that were consistent across all three stages of adolescence. We also identified middle adolescence as the critical period for the rapid development of CAD.\nOverall, these findings provide valuable insights into the understanding of anxiety-depression comorbidity in adolescents and emphasize the need for targeted interventions and preventive measures during specific stages of adolescence. Future work is needed to incorporate these core and bridge symptoms into the design and development of early detection and intervention strategies to address the unique challenges faced by adolescents in managing anxiety and depression.\nAbbreviations: CAD: Comorbid Anxiety and Depression; GAD: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale; PHQ: Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale; CFA: Confirmatory factor analysis; EBIC: Extended Bayesian Information Criterion; CS: Correlation Stability; NCT: Network Comparison Test; CBT: Psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral therapy\nAcknowledgements: Thanks for the assistance of the Shenzhen Academy of Educational Sciences to collect data for this study.\nCorrespondence:\nAuthor details: 1 https://ror.org/01vy4gh70, grid.263488.3, 0000 0001 0472 9649, School of psychology, Shenzhen University, , No. 3688, Nanhai Avenue, Nanshan District, 518060, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. 2 The Shenzhen Humanities & Social Sciences Key Research Bases of the Center for Mental Health, , Shenzhen, China. 3 grid.25879.31, 0000 0004 1936 8972, Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania, , Philadelphia, PA, USA. 4 https://ror.org/0030zas98, grid.16890.36, 0000 0004 1764 6123, Department of Applied Social Science, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, , Hong Kong SAR, China. 5 https://ror.org/03rmrcq20, grid.17091.3e, 0000 0001 2288 9830, Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, , Vancouver, Canada. 6 https://ror.org/0064kty71, grid.12981.33, 0000 0001 2360 039X, Department of Psychology, Sun Yat-sen University, , Guangzhou, China. 7 grid.437123.0, 0000 0004 1794 8068, Department of Psychology, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Macau, , Macau, China. 8 https://ror.org/00gx3j908, grid.412260.3, 0000 0004 1760 1427, School of Psychology, Northwest Normal University, , Lanzhou, China.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nIn the current study, we conducted a network analysis to explore the network structures of CAD and susceptibility differences to CAD in early, middle, and late adolescence. We identified several core symptoms of CAD, as well as bridge symptoms between anxiety and depression in the CAD network. First, \"loss of control\" emerged as the core CAD symptom throughout all three developmental stages. \"Excessive worry\" and \"anhedonia\" were identified as core symptoms in early adolescence, and \"restlessness\" was a core symptom in late adolescence. Second, when concentrating on the overlap between anxiety and depression, \"anhedonia,\" \"sad mood,\" and \"fatigue\" were the bridge symptoms across all three developmental stages, suggesting that these symptoms connect and transmit comorbidity between anxiety and depression. In examining the network structures across three developmental stages, the data revealed that the middle adolescence stage exhibited the highest global strength, with a significant difference observed when comparing the middle to the early adolescence stages. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the middle and late adolescence stages, the middle stage's global strength remained the highest. This suggests that the middle stage of adolescence may be a period of increased vulnerability and susceptibility to mental disorders, including CAD.\nCAD core symptoms\n\"Loss of control\" was identified as highly central in the CAD network throughout the three adolescent stages. This finding aligns with previous studies conducted in different populations. For instance, in studies involving patients diagnosed with both anxiety and depression in Germany (42.24 [+ or -] 14.38 years old, n = 5614) [39], and patients with epilepsy in China (31.5 [+ or -] 2.3 years old, n = 313) [40], \"loss of control\" was also identified as a core symptom. Despite the differences in demographics, associated life stressors, and diagnostic status of participants, the consistency in identifying \"loss of control\" as a core symptom suggests its significance in anxiety-depression comorbidity.\nThe presence of \"loss of control\" as a core symptom across diverse populations indicates its potential as a hallmark symptom in the development of CAD. Psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) have shown effectiveness in improving emotion regulation skills, which can help individuals better cope with feelings of losing control. For example, meta-cognitive therapy can be used to modify adolescents' beliefs about worry, shifting the focus from the concern itself to their thoughts about the concern [41]. By targeting \"loss of control\" as a core symptom and incorporating interventions such as psychoeducation and CBT, it may be possible to enhance emotion regulation and reduce the severity of anxiety and depression comorbidity. This highlights the importance of implementing targeted interventions that address specific core symptoms to improve overall mental well-being in adolescents.\nAdditionally, in early adolescence, \"excessive worry\" and \"anhedonia\" were two core symptoms specific to this stage. Early adolescence typically encompasses the age range of 10-12 years. During this period, self-awareness is gradually enhanced, and adolescents actively explore the external world while facing new tasks and challenges independently [42]. It is not uncommon for them to encounter failure and experience heightened frustration as they navigate these new experiences. Prolonged experiences of failure can lead to a diminished interest in various activities, which is captured by the symptom of \"anhedonia\" [43]. Given the unique challenges faced by early adolescents, it is crucial to implement preventative measures and targeted interventions for these two core symptoms. One approach could involve equipping early adolescents with coping skills and providing them with resources to effectively navigate failure and manage excessive worry. By empowering early adolescents with appropriate strategies, they can develop resilience and adaptive responses to challenging situations, potentially mitigating the risk of anxiety and depression comorbidity.\nOn the other hand, \"restlessness\" was another core symptom in late adolescence, which also requires targeted preventative measures and interventions. Interestingly, this symptom has also been identified as a core symptom of CAD in Chinese adults following the peak of the pandemic [44]. Stressful events and circumstances have been found to play a significant role in the manifestation of restlessness [45].\nIn late adolescence, individuals aged 16-18 in China face a particularly stressful event: a college entrance examination, which is an important event for students and their families. During this final stage of adolescence, individuals are not only burdened by the weight of academic expectations and uncertainties about their future educational and career paths, but also face pressure from teachers and parents [46, 47]. These demanding and stressful circumstances can contribute to a state of restlessness among adolescents.\nTo relieve or alleviate this core symptom, it is essential to provide effective stress management techniques and coping strategies that can help adolescents manage their stress levels. Approaches such as self-compassion, mindfulness, regular exercise, and relaxation techniques like listening to music can be valuable tools in reducing restlessness and promoting emotional well-being [48-51]. Furthermore, it is important for parents and educators to support late adolescents during this critical period of transition into adulthood by providing resources, support systems, and fostering open communication. By creating a nurturing and understanding environment, adolescents can better cope with the stressors they face and build resilience as they navigate this challenging phase of their lives.\nCAD bridge symptoms\nWe found that \"anhedonia,\" \"sad mood,\" and \"fatigue\" may bridge the associations between anxiety and depression and contribute to the development and maintenance of CAD. Similar bridge symptoms have been reported in studies involving different populations, such as migrant Filipino domestic workers in Macao and Chinese nursing students and adolescents [18, 52-54]. It has been proposed that anxiety may transform into depression through the manifestation of \"anhedonia\" [55]. Anhedonia is associated with a decrease in desire, interest, and reinforcement learning [56, 57]. Individuals experiencing prolonged stress and anxiety may progress to a depleted phase characterized by symptoms of fatigue, sad mood, and loss of motivation [58], thereby triggering a depressed state. Additionally, the tripartite model suggests that negative affectivity, such as \"sad mood,\" is common to both anxiety and depression [59]. The sustained arousal caused by worry may lead to emotional and physical exhaustion, eventually resulting in low mood and the development of other depressive symptoms [32]. In this case, the symptom of \"sad mood\" may reflect a progression from anxiety to depression. These findings contribute to our understanding of CAD in adolescence and highlight potential avenues for intervention and prevention strategies aimed at targeting specific core symptoms and bridge symptoms associated with CAD.\nFurthermore, the bridge symptom of \"fatigue\" may be linked to the somatization of psychological distress, which is particularly prevalent in Asian populations, including China [60]. Cultural norms that prioritize the suppression of personal emotions and the persistent stigma surrounding mental health problems contribute to this phenomenon [61]. Adolescents, in particular, are more likely to somaticize their mental health issues rather than directly addressing them [39]. This tendency is further corroborated by qualitative research that examines the stress and coping strategies of adolescents in a Chinese population, where avoidance of direct confrontation with mental health issues is common, and somatization can be a culturally embedded response to distress [62-64].\nBesides, Chinese adolescents face excessive burdens that may contribute to their fatigue [40]. They are often required to dedicate extensive time to academic pursuits, leaving little time for entertainment, social activities, and even adequate sleep. The cumulative effect of these demands on their physical and mental well-being can manifest as fatigue. Overall, the cultural context and the high levels of stress and responsibilities experienced by Chinese adolescents contribute to the prominence of \"fatigue\" as a bridge symptom in CAD. Recognizing these cultural and contextual factors is crucial for understanding the unique manifestations of CAD in this population and for developing targeted interventions and support systems.\nGlobal strength differences in three developmental stages\nThe global strength of the network during middle adolescence was found to be higher compared to early and late adolescence, with a significant difference observed between early and middle adolescence. This finding aligns with a previous study by Cai et al. [18], which also reported significant differences in network global strength between junior and senior secondary school grades. Another study by McElroy et al. [65] observed a higher connectivity in anxiety-depression comorbidity symptom networks at age 14 compared to ages 5 and 6. Despite variations in age and region, these studies collectively suggested that symptoms evolve and may reinforce each other during development, with middle adolescence emerging as a critical period for rapid comorbidity development. The heightened network connectivity observed in this stage suggests that middle adolescence may be a particularly vulnerable time for the onset of mental disorders.\nPotential implications\nThese findings have important potential clinical implications. First, these results highlight the identified core and bridge symptoms as crucial in the development and maintenance of CAD, implying shared mechanisms through which the symptomatology is associated with anxiety and depression. Paying attention to these symptoms is vital for developing interventions that can broadly reduce the risk for CAD in adolescents. Furthermore, our study highlights the severity of CAD in adolescents and demonstrates a progressive increase in susceptibility to the development and persistence of CAD. Specifically, the transition from early to middle adolescence appears to be a critical period for the emergence of CAD, suggesting this specific age range as a target for intervention.",

        "introduction": "Byline: Priyanka. Patel, Krittika. Bhattacharyya, Mayank. Singh, Ravi. Jha, Deepak. Dhamnetiya, Neha. Shri\nBackground: Depression is a major public health concern among Indian adolescents. Pre- and post-natal depression can often alter fetal development and have negative consequences on the physical and mental health of the mother. This paper aims to draw attention to the prevalence of depression and its correlates among currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents from two Indian States, i.e. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Methods: This study utilizes data from a subsample (n = 3116) of the prospective cohort study Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults (UDAYA) among 10 to 19 year-old adolescents. Bivariate analysis was performed to assess the prevalence of depression by sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. To further access the predictors associated with depression a logistic regression model was applied. Results: Around one-tenth (9%) of pregnant adolescents had depression. Regression analysis indicated that substance use, religion, autonomy, considering attempting suicide, premarital relationship, violence, dowry, adverse pregnancy outcome, menstrual problem, and parental pressure for the child immediately after marriage were significantly associated with depression. Conclusions: This study confirms the pre-existing annotation that teen pregnancy is linked with depression. Findings indicate that Adolescent mothers experiencing violence, and a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes are at increased risk of developing depression. These study findings call for an urgent need to address depression among adolescent mothers.\nIntroduction\nWorldwide, teenage pregnancies and adolescent motherhood have a significant impact on the individual, offspring, and family. Pregnancies are identified as a major risk factor for anxiety and depression, especially in the teenage years.[1] Adolescent pregnancies are a global burden in developed as well as developing countries. However, the United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF) states that most of these pregnancies are driven by poverty, lack of education, and reduced employment opportunities and occur in marginalized communities.[2] In a developing country like India, depression is a major public health concern, especially among adolescent females. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) states that in developing countries, complications related to pregnancy and childbirth are the main cause of death among 15- to 19-year-old adolescent brides.[3] The adolescent period is often accompanied by a spectrum of rapid metabolic, hormonal, physiologic, and developmental changes,[4] which in itself is stressful, and this stress is exacerbated by pregnancy, childbirth, and caring for the infant during adolescence. Threatened by a large number of bodily changes, adolescents indulge in risky behavior, alcohol consumption, and drugs or engage in impulsive sexual behavior in attempts to deny their fears.[5] Pregnancy comes with concomitant physiologic and psychological changes and has often been considered a time of emotional well-being.[6] The implications for the health and well-being of the mother and the infant and society are substantial.[7] Young women who marry early have a high risk of depression and suicide.[8] Further, their vulnerability is raised by pregnancy during adolescence. Adolescent mothers have higher chances of having stressful life events in the past, lower cognitive attainment, and poorer school performances in comparison to their non-parenting peers.[9] Although there are thoughts that pregnancy may act as a protection against mental illnesses, however a high prevalence of depression among pregnant women contradicts such beliefs.[10] Studies have reported that the prevalence of depression is higher among pregnant adolescents than for non-pregnant adolescents. Moreover, depression during pregnancy (antenatal depression) increases the risk for postpartum depression.[11],[12] The latest available data from the Fifth wave of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) indicated that 11% of the women in the age group 15-19 years were already a mother at the time of the survey. Further, the adolescent fertility rate was 77 per 1000.[13]\nConsistently, a wide variety of literature has documented higher depressive symptoms among adolescent mothers.[7],[14],[15],[16] Further, young women who marry early are at high risk of depression and suicide.[17],[18],[19] Pregnant and postpartum adolescents are more likely to suffer from depression than their non-pregnant counterparts.[20] Early childbearing poses negative consequences for mothers and their children. Further, it increases the risk of adverse mental health problems: substance abuse, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.[21] Additionally, stereotyping of adolescent mothers and discrimination leads to social exclusion and a high risk for postpartum depression.[22],[23] Adolescent mothers are usually unprepared for parental responsibilities, are poverty-stricken and live in disadvantaged environments, and have high-stress levels, low educational attainment, and fewer psychological resources than women who delay childbearing.[24] It is documented that pregnancy increases the risk of developing depression and anxiety symptoms increase, and this further worsens after childbirth.[25] Further, a study has demonstrated that the incidence of mortality, low birth weight, and pre-term birth is higher in adolescent mothers aged 10-14 years.[26] Additionally, studies have highlighted a significant association, India between depression and maternal age. It is stated that younger mothers experience higher levels of depression as compared to their older counterparts.[27] Domestic violence toward women also has some negative impacts on health such as chronic pain, depression, low self-esteem,[28] substance use, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide.[29]\nResearchers report that depression and anxiety are more prevalent among teenage mothers than adolescent mothers without any child.[25] Further, Evidence suggests that the incidence and prevalence of depression are increasing at a faster pace among youths than adults.[30] Despite a growing literature on depression, the focus has been on adults. Although adolescent childbearing raises important concerns for healthcare providers and society, there is a paucity of research on depression in pregnant adolescents. Considering the severe implications of depression among pregnant teens, this paper aims to draw attention to the prevalence of depression and its correlates among currently married, ever pregnant adolescents from two Indian States, i.e. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.",
        "methodology": "Data and Methods\nWe utilized secondary data from the prospective cohort study Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults (UDAYA) among 10- to 19-year-old which was conducted in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (UP). This survey was led by the Population Council in the year 2016 and was supported by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, David and Lucile Packard Foundation under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), the Government of India. This study collected data on various aspects such as family, mobility and decision-making, self-efficacy, sexual and reproductive matters, health, substance abuse, violence, etc., from unmarried boys (10-19 years), unmarried girls (10-19 years) and married girls (15-19 years). This survey followed a multi-stage systematic sampling approach with three-stage sampling in rural areas and four-stage sampling in urban areas. We have analyzed the data of 3116 currently married adolescent mothers who have ever been pregnant.\nEthical considerations\nRespondent's had every right to refuse to participate or answer any question. Informed consent was sought from each individual to be interviewed, and among unmarried adolescents ages 10-17, consent was also sought from a parent or guardian. Names were never recorded in the computer form in which data were collected, and to preserve the confidentiality of the respondent or the parent/guardian, signing the consent form was optional; however, the interviewer was required to sign a statement that she or he had explained the content of the consent form to the respondent or parent. Privacy in the course of the interview was maintained. The UDAYA survey, which informed this study, was approved by the ethical review board of the Population Council, New Delhi.[31],[32]\nFlow diagram\nAccording to UDAYA Wave 1 (2015-2016), a total of 20594 adolescents are available in the data. Approximately one-fourth of them were married, out of which Gauna was not performed among 7% of women. Among currently married adolescents, a total of 3116 women were ever pregnant, and the remaining were not pregnant till the date of the survey. [Figure 1] summarizes filtering the eligible sample size/ever-been-pregnant for the analysis.{Figure 1}\nVariable's description\nOutcome variable\nThe outcome variable was depression, which was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) using nine items. It is a standard depression screening instrument used worldwide. The depressive severity was assessed using a Likert scale from the respondents. The Likert scale responses included 'not at all (0),' 'several days (1),' 'more than half the days (2),' and 'nearly every day (3).' The responses were recoded and a summary depressive symptom score ranging from 0 to 27 was generated, categorized as 'No depression' (0-9) and Depression' (10-27).[31],[32],[33]\nExposure variables\nSticking to the objectives, the female respondents who were married and were ever pregnant (15-19 years) were found to be eligible for this study. The survey was conducted only in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The place of residence was categorized as rural and urban. Caste was recoded as SC/ST (Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribe), OBC (Others Backward Classless), and Others. Religion was recoded as Hindu and Non-Hindu. The wealth index is composed of household asset data on ownership of selected durable goods, including means of transportation, as well as data on access to a number of amenities. Further, the wealth index was constructed by allocating the following scores to a household's reported assets or amenities and was divided into quintiles, recoded into poorest, poorest, middle, richer, and richest. Eligible respondents' years of education were taken into account, which were categorized as '0-7 years of schooling,' '8-10 years of schooling', '11-12 years of schooling' and '12+ years of schooling'. the variable on 'substance use in the family' was recoded as yes if respondents replied affirmatively on any member of the consuming drug/alcohol/tobacco products. Eligible respondents were asked if they played games and had any premarital relationship was recoded as 'no,' and 'yes.' Variables on father beating mother and violence against respondents used in this study were recoded as 'yes' and 'no.' Data on violence was categorized as emotional, physical and sexual for Married female adolescents. Violence was categorized as emotional if the respondent was ever humiliated in front of others or threatened to hurt or harm something close to her by her husband. Violence was categorized as sexual if the respondent was ever forced by her husband to have sex, including her first sex with her husband. The respondents were asked if they had faced menstrual problems in the last 3 months, and their response was recoded as 'no' and 'yes.' Variable on pressure for the child immediately after marriage was recoded as 'no' and 'yes.' Pregnancy desires were recoded as 'no' and 'yes.' The variable 'seriously considered attempted suicide' shows the response to the question 'During the past 1 year, did you ever seriously consider attempting suicide?' and their response was recoded as yes or no. The categorization/recode of the variables and their response are provided in [Supplement Table A].[INLINE:1]",
        "analysis": "Statistical analysis\nFor analysis purposes, STATA 14.1 software was used. Univariate analysis was carried out to access the sample characteristics of currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents in the reproductive age group 15-19 years. Bivariate analysis was used to see the prevalence of depression by sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, and a further Chi-square test of significance was used to find the association between depression and background characteristics.\nA binary logistic model was employed to analyze the significant predictors. Logistic regression was chosen as the appropriate analysis method because the dependent variable had two categories: 'no' and 'yes,' represented by the codes 0 and 1, respectively.",
        "results": "Results\n[Table 1] presents the sample characteristics of currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents aged 15-19 years and the prevalence of depression by various sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. The majority of the women were from Bihar (67.42%), followed by Uttar Pradesh (32.58%). Among eligible respondents, most of them resided in the rural area (85%), three-fifths (59.5%) of the ever-pregnant women were from the OBC category, and the lowest proportion of respondents were from the Richest wealth index (12.88%). About three-fourths (75.6%) responded that they were living in a family where any of the family members was a substance user (drugs, alcohol, tobacco, at least one of them). Among all married adolescents, only 12% of the women were allowed to visit alone. Fifteen percent of the ever-pregnant adolescents had a premarital relationship. Around one-fifth (20.7%) had the pressure for a child immediately after marriage, and 59.1% reported having desired pregnancy. Only one-third (33.9%) of the currently married women had frequent access to media.{Table 1}\nEvery tenth of currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents was suffering from depression (9.11%). Depression was higher among married adolescents residing in urban areas (11%) and where any of the family members were substance users (10%). Approximately two-fifths (41.5%) of the women who ever seriously considered attempting suicide were found to be depressed. Concomitantly, the prevalence of depression was higher among adolescents who faced violence. Further, among women facing emotional violence, 14% had depression, and 13% of women facing emotional violence were depressed. The prevalence of depression was lower among adolescents who never faced dowry-related abuse or any adverse pregnancy outcome. The prevalence of depression was 13% among adolescents facing the pressure of a child immediately after marriage. Among currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents who did not have a desired pregnancy, 11% were depressed.\nResults obtained from logistic regression analysis are shown in [Table 2]. The women living in rural areas were 12% times and 25% times less likely to have depression (cOR: 0.78, CI: 0.68-1.13; aOR: 0.75, CI: 0.54-1.06) than the women living in an urban area. The religion of the respondent was significantly associated with depression with non-hindus bearing a higher risk of being depressed. Substance use in the family was significantly associated with depression (in the crude model). Adolescents from substance-user families were 1.82 times more likely to have depression than adolescents from non-substance-user families. The likelihood of having depression increased by 7.68 times and 5.06 times, respectively, among the adolescents who ever seriously considered attempting suicide in comparison to women who never seriously considered attempting suicide. Results show that the adolescents facing emotional violence were 2.17 times more likely to have depression, and those facing physical violence were 2.13 times more likely to have depression than those without experience of IPV. However, violence was not significantly associated when all variables were adjusted. Dowry-related abuse was statistically significantly associated with depression in crude as well as adjusted models. The married adolescents who were facing any dowry-related abuse were 2.94 and 2.83 times more likely to have depression than individuals without dowry abuse (crude and adjusted, respectively). Adolescents with adverse pregnancy outcomes were significantly more likely to have depression than women who did not have any adverse pregnancy outcomes in the crude and adjusted model. Adolescents who were currently pregnant were more likely to be depressed. Additionally, in the unadjusted model, adolescents facing menstrual problems in the last 3 months were 2.04 times more likely to have depression. Pressure for a child immediately after marriage was a significant predictor of depression in the adjusted and crude model. Adolescents who were pressured to have a child immediately after marriage were twice more likely to have depression.{Table 2}",
        "limitations": "Limitations\nThe cross-sectional design of the study restricts establishing the causal inferences, and only correlates can be assessed. Additionally, data on the earlier history of depressive symptoms or other disorders were not available. Despite data being sensitive to identify depressive symptoms, the underreporting of symptoms cannot be ignored. Since the depression was not assessed by a psychiatrist, the self-reporting can be biased and may not be as reliable as diagnostic instruments. Although a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms was found among adolescents with adverse pregnancy outcome, it cannot be ascertained whether depression was due to adverse pregnancy outcome or depression following the adverse pregnancy outcome. Furthermore, because the research was limited to two Indian states, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the findings cannot be generalized to the entire country's population.\nConclusions\nDespite the causal limitations, this study confirms the pre-existing annotation that teen pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of having depression. Findings indicate that Adolescent mothers who face violence, dowry-related abuse, menstrual disorder, and adverse pregnancy outcomes are at increased risk of developing depression. Since mental health is often a neglected aspect, especially among adolescents, findings call for an urgent need to address depression among adolescent mothers.\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nNil.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nEarly marriage negatively impacts the physical and psychological well-being of girls. Depression is one of the psychological problems that can occur as a consequence of early marriage. Additionally, pregnancy, if occurred in the teenage years, is an important risk factor for developing anxiety and depression. This study examines the prevalence of depressive symptoms among currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents aged 15-19 years and aims to explore the impact of socioeconomic status, substance use by the respondent or in the family, adverse pregnancy outcome, the experience of violence, and media exposure. The study reveals that depressive symptoms among currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents aged 15-19 years are higher among those residing in urban areas. The results obtained from the regression analysis indicated that religion, substance use, considering attempting suicide, playing games, premarital relationship, violence, dowry, adverse pregnancy outcome, menstrual problems, pressure for the child immediately after birth, pregnancy desire, and sex composition of a child born was significantly associated with depression--the prevalence of depression among currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents was found to be 9.11%. Evidence from past studies shows that the rates of depression vary widely from 16 to 44 percent among pregnant adolescents.[34],[35] Schoenbach and colleagues found the prevalence of depression to be 44% among pregnant teens.[7] Further, researchers report depression to be prevalent among 28% of adolescent mothers.[34],[36] Studies conducted in Mumbai and Bengaluru have reported a lower prevalence of antenatal depression during current pregnancy.[37],[38] Research suggests that rates of depressive disorder are twice higher among pregnant adolescents than adult mothers.[39] Contrary to other findings, the prevalence of depression was higher among respondents from the richer wealth quintile. However, no significant association was observed between wealth status and depression. Further, a number of studies support the hypothesis that lower levels of education are associated with increased depression; results from this study are not in agreement.[40],[41],[42] Findings from this study show that substance use in the family is statistically significantly associated with more depressive symptoms. Substance use has been linked with increasing lifetime occurrence of depressive disorders in the literature.[43],[44]\nWomen who ever considered attempting suicide were at higher risk of being depressed. A study has found that adolescents with suicidal ideation or attempts are at higher risk of developing depressive symptoms, in line with our findings.[35] A number of studies have shown that depression is caused by factors such as pregnancy problems and domestic violence.[18],[45],[46] Numerous studies have emphasized that girls who are married early have higher chances of facing violence in terms of getting physically or mentally abused by their husbands and in-laws.[35],[45] Raj and colleagues report that girls who are married in childhood are at higher risk for depression and suicidality especially due to increased exposure to gender-based violence.[47] Around one-third of adolescent mothers were facing different types of domestic violence. Domestic violence toward women has been reported to result in chronic pain, depression, low self-esteem, and substance use.[28] Further, consistent with our findings, a positive correlation between intimate partner violence and postpartum depression has been documented in the literature.[48],[49]\nOur findings indicate that women who have experienced dowry-related abuse are more likely to have depressive symptoms. Previous research has highlighted that women having dowry agreements have a higher probability of experiencing domestic violence. Further, domestic violence causes serious mental health issues. Harassment by in-laws on the pretext of dowry is reported to be associated with poor mental health and suicides in women.[50],[51] In our study, adolescent mothers having adverse pregnancy outcomes were more likely to have depression. A number of studies have described the prevalence of psychological disorders among parents who have experienced perinatal loss.[52] Histories of recurrent abortion and fetal and neonatal death are significantly associated with high rates of depressive symptoms.[53] The previous study reported an association between depression and anxiety during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and low birth weight.[54] The menstrual disorder was significantly associated with higher levels of depression. Menstrual disorders are documented to be associated with various psychological problems.[55],[56] Moreover, the most common psychological problems include anxiety and depression.[55] Our results indicate that women who are pressured to give birth immediately after marriage are more likely to have depressive symptoms. A meta-analysis conducted in India has shown that adolescents receiving social support from in-laws have a lower prevalence of depression, and social support (from in-laws) acts as a protective risk factor in peripartum depression.[36],[57]\nConsistent with our findings, studies have shown that women having undesired pregnancies are at an increased risk of depression during pregnancy.[58],[59],[60] Pregnancy in itself demands psychological, physiological, and financial preparation. Further, the social and economic burden associated with unplanned pregnancies results in psychological distress. However, results obtained from this study do not show any significant association between intended pregnancy and depression. Studies in India have highlighted that having a girl child is highly related to postnatal depression.[61] However, our study does not show any significant association between the sex of the child and depression among adolescent mothers.",

        "introduction": "Byline: Madhavi. Bhat, Anil. Kakunje, Rajesh. Mithur\nBackground: Dissociative disorder is a condition characterized by disruption of the normal continuity and integration of consciousness, memory, identity, motor functioning, and behavior. Aims: The aim of the study was to study the various psychosocial factors that influence the dissociative episodes in patients. We also looked at the clinical profile and the relation between the type and levels of dissociation with levels of stress in the study sample. Materials and Methods: This descriptive, cross-sectional study with serial sampling had 50 participants who were diagnosed with dissociation as per the International Classification of Diseases-10 criteria. The study was conducted after obtaining clearance from the institutional ethics committee. Dissociative experience of the patients was measured using Severity of Dissociative Symptoms-Adult (Brief Dissociative Experiences Scale [DES-B]-Modified) and stress levels were measured using Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale. Results: The study showed that dissociation was more common among females from urban population, who were single and among students. Dissociative convulsions were found to be the most common type of dissociation in our culture. DES-B showed moderate-to-severe types of dissociative experience in the sample. In 46% of the participants, family conflicts acted as the most common stressor precipitating episodes. There was a psychodynamic connection/explanation between the perceived stress and the presenting complaint. Conclusion: This study highlights the common dissociations, stressors, and the difference seen among males and females. There is a need to understand the stressors of a patient presenting with dissociation for better psychological management.\nIntroduction\nDissociative disorder is a unique condition that has been a focus of controversies about its definition and conceptualization. History and discussions go from demonology to science with a debate spanning for 4000 years; hysteria was strongly associated with supernatural beings and treated with sorcery.[1] It has been debated with a minimum understanding of its psychopathology. Hysteria is the most colorfully depicted neuroses of the 19th century that has drawn several great medical historians and writers. This is that incredible disease that has driven the minds of a great psychoanalytical theorist like Freud.[2] Dissociative disorder is a condition characterized by disruption of the normal continuity and integration of consciousness, memory, identity, motor functioning, and behavior.[3] It causes deficits in sensory and motor functions without any organic basis. The disease is mostly seen in adolescent and young adult women. It is seen often in rural and low socioeconomic status. The presence of stressors as a precipitating factor is often seen in cases of dissociation, but at times, it is difficult to ascertain one. The stressor may include family conflicts, academic failure, and death of dear ones.[4]\nWith rapid urbanization and growing mental health care, the incidence of dissociation is reducing in Western countries, but cases are still been reported in developing countries. Thus, the study of dissociation in developing countries is essential. The aim of the current study was to find the role of various psychosocial factors that influence the dissociative episodes. We also looked at the clinical profile and to find the relation between the type and levels of dissociation with levels of stress in the study population.",
        "methodology": "Materials and Methods\nThe study was done at a tertiary care teaching hospital over a period of 1 year from August 2019 to August 2020 after the institutional ethics committee clearance (YEC2/242) dated 31st of January 2020.\nSample size was calculated using the following formula,[INSIDE:1]\nAt 5% level of significance, prevalence = 0.256, and estimation error = 14%, the total sample size was calculated to be 38. However, we included a total of 50 patients in our study.\nThis descriptive, cross-sectional convenient sample study involved 50 patients who presented to the hospital with a diagnosis of dissociative disorder. Patients of all ages and both inpatients and outpatients who were diagnosed to have dissociative disorder (F 44) according to the International Classification of Diseases-10 criteria were included in the study. Sociodemographic data were collected after taking written informed consent. Patients with intellectual problems and psychotic illnesses were excluded from the study. The study was carried out in accordance with the principles as enunciated in the Declaration of Helsinki.\nAssessment tools:\n*Severity of Dissociative Symptoms-Adult (Brief Dissociative Experiences Scale [DES-B]-Modified) to assess for the severity of dissociative symptoms:[5] It is an 8-item measure. Each item asks the individual to rate the severity of his or her dissociative experiences during the past 7 days on a five-point scale. The total score can range from 0 to 32\nFor persons between 11 and 17 years, Severity of Dissociative Symptoms-Child Age 11-17 (DES-B-Modified) was used.[6]\n*Presumptive Stressful Life Event Scale was used to assess stressors in patients with dissociative disorder:[7] It includes 51 life events, highest stress score being for death of spouse (95). Scores up to 40 indicate less stress, 41-200 indicate moderate stress, and >200 indicate severe stress.\nDescriptive statistics were used for reporting sociodemographical variables and clinical variables. An appropriate statistical test such as Chi-square test was used. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data obtained were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 23 and the results were analyzed.",
        "analysis": "",
        "results": "Results\n[Table 1] shows the sociodemographic data and clinical details of the study sample. Among the 50 patients, 34 (68%) were female and 16 (32%) were male. The mean age of the study sample was 27.32 [+ or -] 11.01 years. Majority of the patients in the study were students (30%) and from urban area (62%). Most of them had completed their matriculation education (44%), single (50%), and were living in a nuclear family type (74%). Fifty-four percent of the patients belonged to low socioeconomic status group. On analyzing the family history, comorbidity, and history, we found that majority of the patients did not have any family history of psychiatric illness (88%) nor family history of dissociative disorder (86%). Furthermore, majority of them did not have any comorbid psychiatric or medical diagnosis (76%), whereas 27 (54%) patients had a history of dissociative episodes.{Table 1}\nVarious types of dissociative disorder in the study sample are shown in [Figure 1]. On categorizing the various types of dissociation in terms of age, we found that dissociative convulsions, dissociative stupor, and mixed dissociative disorder were seen in younger population. Dissociative motor disorder was mostly seen in older individuals. However, trance and possession disorder and dissociative amnesia were exclusively seen in younger population. In both the genders, dissociative convulsion was found to be the most common type of dissociative disorder, followed by dissociative motor disorder. Dissociative stupor, trance and possession disorder, and dissociative amnesia were seen only in females. In our study, 36% of patients experienced moderate and another 36% had severe dissociative symptoms, 22% of patients had mild severity of dissociative experience, and 6% of patients experienced extreme severity of dissociative symptoms. Clinical assessment of patient's stress is shown in [Figure 1].{Figure 1}\nThe difference in stressors between the gender and age groups is explained in [Table 2]. On Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale (PSLES), we found that majority of the patients below 30 years were suffering from moderate stress, while most of the patients above 30 years had severe stress levels. The perceived stress scale scores were found to be moderate in majority of cases of both genders. [Table 3] shows the DES-B scale score and predominant stressor cross-tabulation. Predominant stressor in various types of dissociative disorder is explained in [Table 4].{Table 2}{Table 3}{Table 4}\nWe analyzed the presenting complaints of individual patients in our study sample with the perceived stress as per clinical assessments.\n*A female patient had presented with complaints of forgetfulness to events that occurred after marriage. The patient developed this symptom after she was asked to go to her husband's family house where she was verbally abused *A 45-year-old male patient was completely mute after receiving a phone call from financial lenders to repay the loan taken *A 16-year-old male patient who was not interested to go to college was brought by family members with the complaint of inability to walk *A 25-year-old female patient was in stupourous state after her neighbors made unpleasant comments about her body shape *Another 25-year-old female had unresponsive episode during marriage proposals. Her childhood history revealed sexual abuse *A 20-year-old male who was not interested to speak to his parents due to family conflicts was brought with complaints of inability to speak.\nAll these cases point toward a connection between presenting symptom/particular dissociation and the stressor experienced.",
        "limitations": "Conclusion\nThis study showed the common stressors faced in our culture, the difference in both genders and age groups. It demonstrated the level of dissociation and corresponding level of stress in various types of dissociation. It explains the connection between the possible stress and the presenting symptom. The study of psychopathology in individual cases may yield higher evidence and insight into the problem. Hence, further follow-up studies can be done to look into the psychodynamic factors of this illness in depth.\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nNil.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThere are only few studies on clinical features and sociodemography of patients suffering from dissociation. A study done by Deka et al . on 40 patients showed that dissociation was predominantly seen in young adults between the ages of 18-29 years.[4] Majority of patients (68%) in our study were <30 years of age, which is in line with the findings of other studies which show that dissociative disorder is more common among young adults.[8],[9],[10] The mean age of our study sample was found to be 27.32 [+ or -] 11.01 years. A cross-sectional study done by Reddy et al . on 55 patients revealed that the mean age of the sample was 21.96 [+ or -] 8.61 years.[11]\nIncluding the current study, many previous studies have shown that dissociative disorders are common among females.[4],[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[13],[14],[15],[16],[17],[18],[19],[20] Several explanations have been proposed for this including increased likelihood of seeking help, culturally acceptable modes of expressing distress, increased rates of sexual abuse, and high rates of comorbid depression and anxiety that have a female predominance.[21] Students formed the major group of the study population in work done by Deka et al .,[4] similar to this study. Several studies have been done in the past, which observed the geographical localization of patients in terms of dissociative symptoms. Deka et al . studied the area around the Indian state of Assam and found that majority of the patients with dissociation were from rural background.[4] A cross-sectional study done by Reddy et al . showed that 76.36% of patients were from rural background, while 23.46% had an urban background, which is in contrast to our study, which has predominantly an urban population.[11] In the past, various studies that looked into the education status of the population had given contrasting results. Deka et al . observed that most of the sample population were literates, while Tabassum and Farooq found 71% to be uneducated.[4],[18] Reddy et al . found that 41.82% of their population had reached high school.[11]\nPribor et al . studied a group of female psychiatric patients in the United States and found that majority of the patients were separated or divorced.[22] In the 2012 study published by Reddy et al ., it was found that 52.73% were unmarried and the rest 40% were married.[11] In our study, 50% were unmarried and 46% were married. Single persons are suffering more from dissociation, which indicates a younger age of onset. In the past, it was found that dissociation was more common in people from joint families. Vyas and Bharadwaj found that 61.51% of the cases were from joint families.[12] In contrast to this, our study found that 74% of the cases are from nuclear families, suggesting changing trends. Studies by Deka et al . (75%) and Reddy et al . (72.73%) had found that dissociation was more common in people from the lower socioeconomic background.[4],[11] However, Vyas and Bharadwaj in their study found that 50.32% of cases were from the lower middle-class background.[12] In contrast to the above studies, our study found that 46% were from above poverty line. Again, the above finding shows the changing economic trends of this country. Modeling is a type of observational learning where new behavior is learned by observing others in society. It plays an important role in the onset of dissociative symptoms in dissociative disorders. However, the role model need not be found currently and may be long forgotten. Samuels et al . in their study on children found that an illness model was found in 45% of their cases.[21] In our study, we found that 14% of cases had a family history of dissociative disorder, which significantly affected their modeling behavior. We also found that 12% of our sample had a family history of psychiatric illness other than dissociation.\nComorbid psychiatric conditions are very often found in patients with dissociative disorders. Ghosh et al . made a similar observation in their study and found that 35% of cases had comorbid anxiety or depression.[16] Reddy et al . also observed that comorbid psychiatric conditions were seen in 61.81% of cases, depression being the most common.[11] In contrast to this in our study, we found that comorbid psychiatric or medical diagnosis was seen in 24% of the patients.\nReddy et al . found that the most common presentation of dissociation was dissociative stupor, which was seen in 60% of their total sample, followed by dissociative motor disorder seen in 40% of total cases.[11] Another study by Turgay on children and adolescents with conversion disorder showed that pseudoseizures were the most common type of conversion symptom, which occurred in 63 cases of the 137 samples taken.[23] Spitzer et al . by studying their inpatient sample found that 29% of their cases had psychogenic seizures exclusively.[24] In our study too, dissociative convulsions in 60% of the total sample was the most common followed by dissociative motor disorder, which was seen in 20% of the people.\nWe further attempted to measure the age distribution of the various types of dissociative disorders. In our study, we found that 73.3% of dissociative convulsion cases were below 30 years of age. Similarly, dissociative stupor and mixed dissociative disorder were more common in the younger population. Dissociative motor disorder was more common in older age group. Dissociative amnesia, trance, and possession attack were exclusively seen in the younger age group. As per our knowledge, there have not been any previous studies looking at this parameter. We found that dissociative convulsion is the most common type of presentation in both the genders. However, dissociative stupor, trance, and possession disorder and dissociative amnesia were found only in females. Using DES-B, we found that 36% of our dissociation patients had moderate dissociative experience, while another 36% had severe dissociative experience. Extremely severe dissociative experience was seen in only 6% of cases. We could not find any study looking at this observation in dissociative disorder cases.\nSeveral studies have observed the predominant stress in people with dissociation. Ghosh et al . studied children and found that poor scholastic performance was the most common cause for dissociation in boys, while discrimination among siblings by parents was the most common stress among girls.[16] Reddy et al . found in their study that family disharmony was present in 41.82% of cases, which acted as the most common stressor in precipitating dissociative episodes.[11] Ammati et al . studied the common stressful life events in somatoform disorder patients and found that financial issues (27.7%) constituted the most common stressful life event in majority, followed by marital conflicts (20.5%) and family conflicts (18.7%).[25] In a recent study by Sawant and Umate, marital and family conflict were predominant stressors in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES).[20] Our study too found that 46% of cases had family conflict, which acted as an immediate stressor in precipitating dissociative episodes, followed by financial problems which were seen in 20% of cases.\nWe found that among males, 56% had financial problems as a predominant stressor. Among females, we found that 61% of them had family conflicts as the predominant stressor which precipitated episodes. A similar finding was observed by Ammati et al ., which found that females reported life events related to relationship issues and males reported more life events related to financial issues.[25] When we observed the stressors in two different age groups, we found that in the population <30 years, family conflicts acted as the most common stressor, while in patients above 30 years, financial problems were most significant.\nPSLES scores were also compared between males and females. We found that both males and females had dissociation with moderate stress. Similarly, when we looked into the age of the subjects, we found that majority of patients below 30 years of age had only moderate stress, while cases above 30 years of age had severe stress. We were unable to find any study looking at these factors.\nWe tried to find the predominant stressor in every type of dissociative disorder. On analyzing our data, we found that family conflicts were the most common reason for dissociative convulsions. The above finding was similar to the results shown by Sawant and Umate on PNES.[20] When we analyzed the dissociative motor disorders, we found that financial problems were the commonest precipitators. We further analyzed the association between the presenting complaint and the stressor. On analyzing the reason for a patient presenting with mutism following a phone call from lenders to repay the loan, we found that it could be a way to handle the present situation of stress. A young boy presented with an inability to walk as he was not interested to go to college. Similarly, a patient presenting with an unresponsive episode during marriage proposals might be a way to avoid the relationship. A patient presenting with amnesia only to events after her marriage might be to suppress the bad memories, which occurred previously. Similarly, all 50 cases were studied for the psychological connection. We can definitely see a connection between presenting complaints and the precipitating stressor in most of the patients.\nStrengths of our study are that it had a reasonable sample size, both genders included with all types of dissociation. We included more number of participants than required as per the sample size calculation. It included people of all ages including children. The present study looked at the stressors of individual patients and has analyzed the association between the clinical presentation of the patient and the stress. Limitations are its cross-sectional nature and study done in a hospital setting. Personality traits and coping mechanisms of the patients were not taken into consideration in our study. Recollection of stressors during interview can have some recall bias.",

        "introduction": "Background: This study is aimed to examine the direct and indirect effects of negative affectivity (NA) and sensory processing hypersensitivity (SPH) in the explanation of variations in dreams and sleep quality based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in outpatients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Methods: Mean age for women (N = 100) and men (N = 100) were 26.53 and 31.74 years, respectively. The participants responded to a demographic sheet, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales- 21 (DASS-21), the Highly Sensitive Persons Scale (HSPS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Mannheim Dream Questionnaire (MADRE) measures in this study. Results: The results showed a significant positive and direct connection between NA and SPH with dreams and sleep quality. SPH in outpatients with GAD moderated the relationship of NA with dreams and sleep quality. Finally, dreams and sleep quality had significant positive relationships in this sample. Conclusion: This conceptual model for dreams and sleep quality is beneficial for developing psychotherapeutic interventions in outpatients with GAD.\nAuthor(s): Siamak Khodarahimi 1 , Fazlolah Mirderikvand 1 , Kourosh Amraei 1\nAuthor Affiliations:\n(1) grid.411406.6, 0000 0004 1757 0173, Psychology Department, School of Literature and Humanities Sciences, Lorestan University, , Khorramabad, Iran\nIntroduction\nNegative affectivity (NA) is a disposition trait defined by patterns of experiencing a range of unpleasant and negative emotions (Watson & Clark, 1984; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988b). Individuals vary in NA trait levels, and some individuals are more likely to experience negative emotions, even without an external stressor (Gross, 1999). Overall, NA is the state of inner feeling (affect) which occurs when one has failed to achieve a target or avoid a threat or when an individual is not fulfilled with the current state of affairs (APA, 2020). People who have difficulty in regulating of their negative emotions often experience exaggerated negative effects on several occasions and they are at the greater risk for developing of pathological anxiety and depression (Cohen et al., 2017; Davidson, 2000; Iqbal & Dar, 2015; Stringer, 2013; Watson, Clark, & Carey, 1988a). Studies have shown that emotional suppression may increase NA during emotional provocation in individuals while emotional acceptance may decrease NA and it prevent the development of anxiety disorders (Campbell-Sills, David, Brown, & Hofmann, 2006; Cisler & Olatunji, 2012). Also, research has demonstrated the important role of limbic system hyperactivity (e.g., amygdala) in responding to negative stimuli and impulsivity as sources of NA in the psychopathophysiology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults (Ferreira-Garcia, Gitahy Falcao Faria, Nardi, & da Rocha Freire, 2019; Yin et al., 2017).\nIn addition, NA is linked to more precise self-perceptions such as negative self-concept and low self-esteem that resulting in more sensory and perceptual dysfunctions (Conner & Barrett, 2005; Mirams et al., 2014). Also, research has shown that the negative effect is positively correlated with sensory sensitivity, avoidance and low enrollment in healthy adults (Engel-Yeger & Dunn, 2011a). Rothbart's temperament model conceptualised that negative affect is associated with sensory responsiveness and easy control with sensory regulation (Rothbart, 2011). Brindle, Moulding, Bakker, and Nedeljkovic (2015) showed significant correlations between sensory-processing sensitivity and symptoms of anxiety and stress. Otherwise, the concept of sensory processing of interoception can influence anxiety disorders including GAD (Khalsa et al., 2018). Aron, Aron, and Davies (2005) showed that individuals with sensory processing hypersensitivity (SPH) had higher scores on NA measures in their childhood compared to those with low sensory sensitivity. Studies indicated significant associations between sensory processing sensitivity and symptoms of depression and anxiety (Bakker & Moulding, 2012; Brindle et al., 2015). Greven et al. (2019) conceptualized that SPH as a differential susceptibility has an interaction with negative experiences, and in turn increases the risk of stress-related psychopathology such as anxiety disorders. Furthermore, people with sensory sensitivity and sensory processing problems like sensory evasion have more anxiety (Engel-Yeger & Dunn, 2011a; Machingura et al., 2019). Wamsley and Stickgold (2010) showed a relationship between sensory processing inputs and the creation of scenarios in dreams. Merced (2012) showed that brain areas that cover sensory functions become active during dreams. Windt, Harkness, and Lenggenhager (2014) suggested that sensory attenuation of self-produced tickles can influence the nature of dream characters. Also, dysfunctional patterns in sensory processing were related to sleep patterns and more sleep problems in adults (Foitzik & Brown, 2018; Engel-Yeger & Dunn, 2011b).\nAdditionally, the potential role of NA on sleep and dreams seems to be an important problem in the development of anxiety disorders. Alvaro, Roberts, and Harris (2013) suggested that insomnia can predict the prevalence of anxiety and depression and, consequently, these disorders can predict the prevalence of insomnia. Latif, Hughes, and Bendall (2019) showed that NA was positively correlated with sleep disturbances. Fortunato and Harsh (2006) proposed a hyper-responsivity model which suggests that NA operates to amplify individuals' perceptions and reactions to their negative environmental events, and then influences the aspects of sleep quality among them (Fortunato & Harsh, 2006). Zink and Pietrowsky (2015) suggested that protoconsciousness as the functional interaction between sleep and wakefulness depends primarily on emotions. Research has shown that real experiences of negative affects can influence the content of dreams (Kallmeyer & Chang, 1998; Ritchie & Skowronski, 2008). Clinical studies have demonstrated evidence on the possible relation between dream experience and affective disorders (Domhoff & Schneider, 2008; Levin & Nielsen, 2007; Schredl, 2011; Valli & Revonsuo, 2009). Schredl and Hofmann (2003) noted that emotional involvement may moderate the incorporation of waking-life experiences into dreams. Altogether, studies reported that dream experience represents a powerful linkage to affective processes in individuals (Scarpelli, Bartolacci, D'Atri, Gorgoni, & De Gennaro, 2019; Schredl, Gei\u00dfler, & G\u00f6ritz, 2019). Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the roles of NA and SPH in the prediction of sleep quality and dreams using the structural modeling equation (SEM) in outpatient adults with GAD.\nTheoritically, Freud (1900) and Jung (1948) claimed that the content of sleep and dreams reflect experiences that were hard to regulate in waking time because of their threatening nature. Freud (1900) proposed that latent content of dreams as the subconscious process included intensified sensations and negative affectivity of sleeper, and it protects the dreamer from disturbing drives until it turns into a manifest dream. Neuropsychoanalytical studies indicated that brain mechanisms of the dream are originated with a wish in daily life (Johnson & Flores Mosri, 2016). Cai (2015) hypothesized that rapid eye movement (REM) and non-speed eye movement (NREM) on sleep functions are most relevant to the assumptions of psychoanalysis in sleep and dreams. According to conceptualizations on sleep and dreams in psychodynamic and neuropsychoanalytical approaches (Freud, 1900; Johnson & Flores Mosri, 2016; Jung, 1948), neuropsychobiological models in dreams (Gallese, 2013; Hobson, 2009; Khalsa et al., 2018) and dream-based psychotherapies (Ellis, 2020; Hill & Knox, 2010); this study suggests that NA and HPS have potential roles in sleep and dreams in adults with GAD. Thus, it seems that psychological and neuropsychobiological dysfunctions using NA and SPH may influence sleep quality and dreams in patients with GAD. This study suggests that there are potential relationships between NA (i.e. depression, anxiety and stress), SPH; and NAS and SPH may help to predict sleep quality and dreams in outpatients with GAD. This study suggests that there are two types of variables in the Structural Equation Model (SEM) that cause a change in sleep and dream quality: (1) NA, and (2) SPH. This study suggests that there are direct or indirect effects between these independent variables and sleep quality (i.e., subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction) and dreams (i.e., dream recall and attitudes toward dreams(as the dependent variables in GAD. This study uses SEM to explore the direct and indirect effects of NA and SPH for explaining of overt and latent changes in sleep quality and dream in outpatients with GAD. The main hypothesis of this study is that NA and SPH would have significant direct and indirect effects on sleep quality and dreams in adults outpatients with GAD.",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants\nThe sample included 200 outpatient adults with GAD from Shiraz City, Fars province, Iran. All participants were recruited by a purposeful sampling procedure. Mean of the age for females and males were 26.53 (SD = 8.95) and 31.74 (SD = 11.52), respectively. The educational level ranged from under high school diploma (N = 53), associate (N = 64), bachelor (N = 76), and master and doctoral (N = 7) in this sample. Of the total participants, 121 were single and 79 individuals were married. All outpatients had a problem of sleep disturbance. The sample was comprised of Fars (N = 144), Lor (N = 29), and Turk (N = 27) ethnics and all were Muslims. The occupational positions in this sample consisted of management occupations (N = 12), office employee (N = 22), sales and service staff (N = 9), specialized farmer (N = 7), craftsmen and related businesses (N = 6), operator of machinery and technology (N = 3), and easy jobs (N = 141). Following informed consent, participants were asked to fill out a demographic questionnaire and Persian versions of four measures in Persian.\nInstruments\nDepression, Anxiety and Stress Scales- 21 (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). DASS-21 is a self-rating measurement scale that established to evaluate three affective and emotional conditions: Depression, anxiety, and stress. For scoring, participants read each statement, then circle a number 0, 1, 2 or 3 that indicates how much the claim applied to their affective status. The DASS-21 is broadly applied to measure symptoms of affective distress in clinical and non-clinical adult samples (Oei et al.,2013; Sinclair et al., 2012). Also, reliability and validity of the Persian version of DASS-21 has been satisfactory amongst the Iranian adult population (Asghari, Saed, & Dibajnia, 2008). This study showed Cronbach's internal constancy from. 70,. 74,. 73 and. 82 for depression, anxiety and stress and DASS-21, respectively.\nHighly Sensitive Persons Scale (HSPS; Aron & Aron, 1997). HSPS was used to examine physiological reactivity to external factors as well as subtle sensitivity to stimuli. The HSPS is a self-rating scale to evaluate the following three components: Ease of excitation, aesthetic sensitivity, and low sensory threshold. The HSPS is an inventory in which each statement is scored from 1 to 7 (1 = \"totally disagree\") to 7 (7 = \"totally agree\"). The HSPS showed the suitable reliability and content, convergent and discriminant validity in different populations (Aron & Aron, 1997; Ershova et al., 2018). Psychometric features of HSPS was demonestrated in the Iranian population (Sadooghi, Aguilar-Vafaie, & Rassoulzadeh Tabatabaei, 2008). This study showed internal Cronbach's consistency reliability of.75,.80,.81 and.77 for ease of excitation, aesthetic sensitivity and low sensory threshold subscales, and HSPS, respectively.\nPittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al.,1989). The PSQI is a subjective measure of sleep quality that is used to assess sleep patterns in adults during the last month. PSQI differentiates sleep quality by measuring of seven domains: Subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction. The participants asked to self-rate each of these seven areas of sleep. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. PSQI has internal consistency, reliability, and validity coefficient in a variety of adult populations (Buysse, Reynolds 3rd, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989; Hinz et al., 2017). This study showed internal Cronbach's consistency reliability of.71,.70,.71,.71,.84,.70,.71 and.78 for subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction, and PSQI, respectively.\nMannheim Dream Questionnaire (MADRE; Schredl, Berres, Klingauf, Schellhaas, & G\u00f6ritz, 2014). The MADRE is an inventory to get a good overview of the different aspects of dreams. The present questionnaire was developed to elicit some form of dream history including dream recall, nightmares, lucid dreaming, attitude towards dreams, and the effects of dreams on waking life. MADRE distinguishes dreams by measuring two domains: Dream recall and attitudes toward dreams. Altogether, retest reliability of MADRE scale was r =.756 (Schredl et al., 2014). The psychometric properties of MADRE were satisfactory (Schredl et al., 2014; Schredl & G\u00f6ritz, 2019). The MADRE indicated good psychometric properties in Iranian population; and its Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.75 for the overall scale (Shahabian et al., 2017). This study showed internal Cronbach's consistency reliability of.73,.71 and.78 for dream recall and attitudes toward dreams subscales, and MADRE, respectively.\nDesign and Procedure\nThis study was designed to explore the role of NA and SPH in predicting of sleep quality and dreams using SEM in a sample of outpatient adults with GAD. The sample size is determined with relevance to the statistics for SEM (Randolph & Myers, 2013). Inclusion criteria were (1) being an adult, (2) have no physical disease with mental symptoms, (3) have no comorbid psychological disorders, (4) to meet all criteria for GAD in DSM-5 Criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), (5) a score of more than 10 on the GAD-7 (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & L\u00f6we, 2006), (6) use no medications for GAD, (7) have a significant sleep problems, and (8) totally being able to understand the Persian language. Overall, 7 participants had less score than 10 in GAD-7 and they removed from the data pool. Volunteer participants were identified at several psychology clinics using a purposive sampling method as part of the study. There was no payment for participants.",

        "results": "Results\nSEM was used to examine the direct and indirect effects of NA (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress) as independent variable, and SPH (i.e., ease of excitation, aesthetic sensitivity and low sensory threshold) as moderating variable in the explanation of sleep quality (i.e., subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction) and dreams (i.e., dream recall and attitude towards dreams) as dependent variables in this sample. The manifest variables of NA involved depression, anxiety and stress. The manifest variables of SPH included ease of excitation, aesthetic sensitivity and low sensory threshold. The manifest variables of sleep quality were subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction. The manifest variables of dreams contained dream recall and attitude towards dreams. According to Kline (2011), the baseline assumptions for SEM implementation are met in this study. Table 1 represents descriptive statistics for the obvious variables. The lowest and highest values of Mahalanobis's distance were.57 and 11.70, respectively. This analysis showed no outliers in the manifest variables of the sample. In addition, absolute magnitude of kurtosis and skewness for all manifest variables were less than 3 and 10 in this study. Analysis showed that all manifest variables are normally distributed. Thereby, the assumption of normality for the implementation of SEM among manifest variables were met in the present study. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) ranged from.12 to 2.94, and the range of tolerance statistic was between.36 and.98. According to these findings, tolerance values for all variables were higher than 0.10. Also, values of VIF were less than 10 in the present study. These findings did not show any significant multicollinearity between variables in this sample. Altogether, analysis showed satisfactory basic assumptions for running the SEM in this study.

Reliability analyses using the SEM for Cronbach's alpha and Composite Reliability (CR) research measures revealed an excellent level of internal consistency (ranging from.73 to.92), with the Composite Reliability (CR) for the overall sample ranging from.84 to.93(Table 2). Results showed that the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) for measures of NA, SPH, dreams and sleep quality were.638,.969,.900, and.781 respectively. Also, the AVE squared matrix and correlation coefficient between measures of research structures (Discriminant Validity) were also satisfactory (Table 3).

Consistent with the current hypothetical model, the results indicated that the evidence for the suitability of the conceptual model for predictive roles of independent and moderating variables in the explanation of dependent variables is generally satisfactory (RAMSE =.074, SRMR =.06, d-ULS =.933,, [chi]2/df = 733.34, NFI = 1.08).\nFigure 1 shows explained variance, factor loads, and direct and indirect effects of NA and SPH as independent variables in the explanation of dreams and sleep quality as dependent variables in this sample Thus, the effect of NA on dreams and sleep quality with regard to the moderating effects of SPH were computed using the SEM with Smart-PLS. Results indicated that NAS explain 52.5%, 85.9% and 81.9% of HPS, dreams and sleep quality variations in this sample (Fig. 1). These results relect the confirmation of the main hypothesis of this study.Fig. 1\nResults of SEM, Explained Variance, Factor Loads, Direct and Indirect Effects of Observed Variables\nWith regard to the path coefficients between latent constructs of the model, NA have positive relationships with SPH,.725; dreams,.222; and sleep quality,.338; whilst NA with the moderating effect of SPH have idirect positive path coefficient with dreams,.542; and sleep quality;.630, in this study. In addition, SPH variable have positive path coefficients with both of dreams and sleep quality respectively. Factor loadings for depression, anxiety and stress observed components of NA were.718,.891 and.777 respectively. Factor loading coefficients for ease of excitation, aesthetic sensitivity, and low sensory threshold components of SPH were.974,.988 and.991 respectively. In addition, dreams and sleep quality had significant positive relationships,.225, in this sample (Fig. 1). Figure 2 illustrates then SEM coefficients and factorial loads for this study. Overall, t-value of the SEM lines for depression, anxiety and stress as obvious component of NA; aesthetic sensitivity and low sensory threshold as obvious components of SPH, and dreams and sleep quality as latent constructs was higher than 2.58 (Fig. 2).Fig. 2\nSignificance of SEM Coefficients and Factor Loads",
        "limitations": "",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nFirst, reliability of measures using Cronbach's alpha and Composite Reliability (CR) and validity of measures using AVE for discriminant validity as a basic assumption for computation of SEM were affirmed in this study. Thus, the measures of NA, SPH, dreams and sleep quality are reliable and valid for this sample. These results are compatible with studies about the effectiveness of PLS software for calculation of psychometric properties of research measures (Schreiber et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2014).\nSecond, the results of SEM calculation for direct effects of NA as independent variable in explaining both manifest and latent variations of SPH as dependent variable showed that NA explain 52.5% of SPH variation in patients with GAD. These results support the main hypothesis and show the direct and predictive role of NA on SPH in this study. Results showed that depression, anxiety and stress have a significant positive path coefficient with SPH. Results indicated that factor loadings and the direct effect of observed variables were significant for depression, anxiety and stress on SPH. There was a direct significant positive relationship between depression, anxiety and stress with SPH. Therefore, all observed components of NA are effective on SPH. This finding is consistent with the literature which affirming the relationship between negative affectivity and sensory sensitivity in adults (Bakker & Moulding, 2012; Brindle et al., 2015; Engel-Yeger & Dunn, 2011a; Machingura et al., 2019). In line with Rothbart (2011) conceptualization, this study explored the role of negative affectivity on SPH in patients with GAD. As argued by Greven et al. (2019), it appears that negative affects and SPH interact with GAD risk.\nThird, the reults of this study showed significant positive and direct relationships between NAS, dreams and sleep quality in outpatients with GAD. Findings showed that NA explain 85.9% and 81.9% of dreams and sleep quality variations in patients with GAD. In addition, the results of this study indicated significant positive and direct relationships between NA, dreams and sleep quality in outpatients with GAD. Primarily, these findings are congruent to the literature which demonstrated the roles of negative affects as a temperamental and psychological predisposition by occurrence of psychopathophysiology mechanisms like increased sensitivity, emotional dysregulation, negative self-perceptions and suppression of negative emotions that influences the emergence of GAD and anxiety disorders in adults (Cisler & Olatunji, 2012; Cohen et al., 2017; Iqbal & Dar, 2015; Watson et al., 1988a). Subsequently, these results correspond to the literature that has demonstrated a bilateral relationship between NA, dreams and sleep quality in anxiety disorders (Alvaro et al., 2013; Bouwmans, Bos, Hoenders, Oldehinkel, & de Jonge, 2017; Kallmeyer & Chang, 1998; Latif et al., 2019; Levin & Nielsen, 2007; Schredl, 2011; Weinstein, Campbell, & Vansteenkiste, 2018). In line with Zink and Pietrowsky (2015) and Schredl and Hofmann (2003), these results suggest that hyperreactivity, protoconsciousness and mechanisms of emotional involvement are responsible for the influence of NA on dreams and sleep quality in patients with GAD. In addition, this study revealed significant negative and direct relationships between NA and the dreams in patients with GAD. This result is consistent with the assumptions of psychodynamic and analytic approaches in dream psychology (Cai, 2015; Freud, 1900; Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, Marcaggi, & Baleyte, 2013; Johnson & Flores Mosri, 2016; Zhu, 2013). According to these conceptualizations, this study suggests that increased NA in daily life may lead to higher emotional suppression, and this mechanism may reduce dream recall levels and dream attitudes in patients with GAD.\nForth, the results of the present study indicated significant positive and direct relationships between SPH, dreams and sleep quality in outpatients with GAD. Results indicated that factor loadings and the direct effect of observed variables were significant for the ease of excitation and aesthetic sensitivity compnents of SPH on dreams and sleep quality. These results are congreunt with the literature where it is indicated that interoception may increase the risk of anxiety in sensory processing sensitivity (Brindle et al., 2015; Khalsa et al., 2018). Moreover, these results are consistent with previous studies in the field of sensory processing experiences in waking, dreams and sleep quality (Engel-Yeger & Dunn, 2011b; Windt et al., 2014; Foitzik & Brown, 2018; Merced, 2012; Wamsley & Stickgold, 2010). Altogether, these investigations showed that daily sensory processing inputs could influence dreams and sleep quality through a full range of mind/brain states.\nFifth, the results in the current study showed significant indirect and positive relationships between NA with dreams and sleep quality by moderating role of SPH in outpatients with GAD. These results support the main hypothesis and show the indirect predictive role of NA with the moderating influence of SPH on dreams and sleep quality in this study. Results showed that depression, anxiety and stress components of NA have a significant positive path coefficient with dreams and sleep quality with the moderating effects of the ease of excitation and aesthetic sensitivity components of SPH. Therefore, all observed components of NA are indirectly effective on dreams and sleep quality by the moderating influence of SPH. In line with Rothbart's model of temperament (Rothbart, 2011), this study showed the moderating effect of SPH on relationships between NA with dreams and sleep quality in GAD. Altogether, these findings are consistent with the predictions of psychodynamic and analytical conceptualizations (Cai, 2015; Freud, 1900; Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 et al., 2013; Johnson & Flores Mosri, 2016; Zhu, 2013), neuropsychobiological models of dreams and sleep (Gallese, 2013; Hobson, 2009; Khalsa et al., 2018; Wamsley & Stickgold, 2010), and Rothbart's model of temperament (Rothbart, 2011). Regarding these theoritical frameworks, this study suggests that NA can ultimately influence dreams and sleep quality by producing of sensory and perceptual dysfunctions such as attentional bias, protoconsciousness processing and affective suppression. Thereby, sensory processing plays a mediating role between individuals' affective state and their dreams and sleep quality in GAD.\nSixth, the results of this study showed significant positive relationships between dreams and sleep quality in outpatients with GAD. This finding is in agreement with the assumption of bilateral relationship between dream and sleep in psychodynamic and neuropsychoanalytical approaches (Freud, 1900; Johnson & Flores Mosri, 2016; Jung, 1948) and neuropsychobiological models in dream and sleep theories (Gallese, 2013; Hobson, 2009; Khalsa et al., 2018). In conclusion, this study shows a fitted SEM for the predictive roles of NA and SPH, and indirect effect of NA with a moderating role of SPH on the prediction of dreams and sleep quality in outpatients with GAD.\nImplications, Limitations, and Future Suggestions\nIndeed, this is a clinical knowledge with direct clinical implications for sleep quality and dreams GAD. Clinical psychologists and psychotherapists can apply these findings for addressing to the roles of negative affects and sensory processing dysfunctions in the treatment of sleep problems and dream applications in patients with GAD. The psychotherapeutic methods in clinical psychology should be consider the potential roles of NA and SPH in conceptualiziation and treatment of sleep disturbances and dream implementations in patients with GAD. Also, these results are valuable for the prevention purposes of dreams and sleep disturbances in adults' mental health programs, particularly for health and community psychologists who work with mind and body interaction in anxiety disorders. First, the present study has limitations because only self-reporting scales were utilized to measure NA, SPH, dreams and sleep disturbances. Second, it was a clinical sample in GAD rather than a representative sample in anxiety disorders and therefore findings cannot be generalised to anxiety disorders in adults. Third, this sample was from an eastern population and it should be justified in the western populations too. Future studies should investigate structural equation models for the direct and indirect effects of NA and SPH on dreams and sleep quality with multiple measures and qualitative methods in different types of anxiety disorders with diverse cultural backgrounds. Lastly, it is essential for upcoming studies to apply quantitative psychological tests, psychophysiological measures and qualitative techniques on behalf of clinicians to understand how NA and SPH can influence dreams and sleep quality in patients with GAD.\nDeclarations\nEthical Approval\nAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee.\nInformed Consent\nInformed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.\nData Transparency\nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nConflict of Interest\nAuthors have not any conflict of interst in this study.",

        "introduction": "As the threat of climate change looms large, and we experience first-hand the impacts of rapid global warming, researchers and clinicians emphasize the need to better understand the impact of these changes on our mental health. Existing research suggests that coping with and emotional reactions to climate change can promote action to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change and reduce its negative impacts to one's mental health. In this pre-registered study (N = 771) we examined whether people who display extreme intergenerational concern would also constructively cope with climate change. Empirically-identified individuals showing high intergenerational concern reported more problem-focused and meaning-based coping, and less avoidant coping strategies with climate change. Further, even though they felt guilty, angry, sorrowful and isolated, these individuals also felt hopeful about the future. These effects were explained by increased concerns about one's legacy and higher access to environmental cognitive alternatives. By instilling values that highlight intergenerational concern as a key priority, we could thus not only increase pro-climate action, but also help individuals actively and constructively cope with changes produced by climate change.\nKeywords: Coping, Emotions, Climate change, Legacy, Environmental cognitive alternatives\nAuthor(s): Stylianos Syropoulos1,2 , Kyle Fiore Law3 , Andrea Mah4 and Liane Young1\nAs climate threats reach unprecedented heights [1-4], a growing consensus among researchers and clinicians underscores the pressing need to expand our perspective beyond physical environmental repercussions and recognize the impact of the ongoing climate crisis on the mental health and well-being of our global community [5-11]. Emerging research in this vein underscores the impact of climate change on mental health, but also that coping strategies and emotional reactions strongly predict pro-environmental engagement [12, 13]. Yet, the effects of climate change are projected only to intensify over time, with its most substantial consequences expected to profoundly shape the distant future of humanity [14-16]. The growing social movement and ethical philosophy of longtermism explicitly advocates for protecting the welfare of future generations [17-19], and nascent psychological inquiry into longtermism beliefs highlights that individuals with a strong sense of intergenerational concern tend to exhibit heightened pro-environmental attitudes and engagement [20-24].\nDrawing upon existing theory and evidence, we investigate whether individuals showing a high amount of intergenerational concern (1) cope with climate change more constructively and (2) emotionally respond with both more concern and hope relative to general population controls. We also explore whether legacy concerns [25] and the ability to generate cognitive alternatives to the current environmental status quo [26] mediate any noted effects of intergenerational concern on coping and emotional reactions to climate change.\nMeasuring intergenerational concern using the longtermism beliefs scale\nLongtermism refers to an ethical philosophy advocating equal concern for current and future generations [17-19, 27, 28] and a social movement with a modest but dedicated and rapidly expanding following [29-31]. Longtermist ideology is guided by three key principles: (1) expressing concern for the well-being of future generations, (2) acknowledging the vast potential of humanity if extinction risks are reduced, and (3) recognizing the current generation's capacity to shape a positive future for humankind. Thus, longtermism is very much synonymous with showing a large degree of intergenerational concern.\nDespite the longtermism movement being subject to numerous criticisms in the popular press [29, 32], the longtermism philosophy provides a structured framework for studying the psychological dynamics of intergenerational concern. Emerging research in this vein from social psychology and cognitive science has employed the Longtermism Beliefs Scale (LBS) [22], which leverages items derived directly from eminent philosophical writings concerning longtermist principles [18, 19] to better understand the psychological antecedents and consequences of endorsing them. A significant portion of this research employs a scoring approach to categorize participants into two distinct subject groups: \"longtermists,\" who show substantial levels of intergenerational concern for both near and distant future generations, and general population controls, who either do not show above average levels of intergenerational concern or exhibit a declining level of concern for future generations as the timeframe under consideration extends further into the future [22-24, 33, 34]. In essence, empirically classified longtermists show a marked departure from the prevailing tendency displayed by most individuals [35-39] to consistently undervalue the well-being of future generations.\nThe psychological and pro-environmental profiles of intergenerational concern\nLongtermists empirically identified through the LBS exhibit not only a greater likelihood of self-identifying with the longtermism philosophy, but also a robust profile characterized by intergenerational concern, prosocial tendencies, and farsighted attitudes and behaviors [22, 33]. For instance, longtermists exhibit greater moral consideration for the welfare of individuals in distant future generations and also extend their moral concern to present-day outgroups relative to controls, ascribing to them elevated human-like capacities and characteristics [20, 24]. To further corroborate the connection between longtermism beliefs and prosocial tendencies, we can turn to the literature on moral expansiveness and dehumanization. A substantial body of literature has established a relationship between possessing a broad moral circle and reduced dehumanization tendencies with prosocial inclinations that surpass the typical parochial biases often constraining prosociality in the broader population [40-46]. Relatedly, longtermists demonstrate heightened levels of expansive altruism that extend across social distance and elevated utilitarian decision-making. Longtermist personality profiles are characterized by patterns of traits on the BIG-5 and HEXACO inventories [47, 48] as well as on measures of Dark Tetrad traits [47, 49, 50] and Primal World Beliefs [51], which are strongly aligned [52, 53] with prosocial behavior [22-24, 33, 34]. In terms of behaviors, longtermists, when compared to members of the general population, tend to make larger donations to charities benefitting future generations, show more support for farsighted public policies, and are more inclined to invest cognitive effort for the betterment of future generations [22, 34].\nHowever, beyond demonstrating consistent patterns of heightened intergenerational and present-day prosocial attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, longtermists also exhibit consistent patterns of pro-environmental attitudes and both top-down and bottom-up pro-environmental engagement. Compared to non-longtermists in the general population, individuals identified as longtermists through high scores on the LBS display stronger support for pro-environmental public policies in general and initiatives advocating climate justice for future generations and present-day minoritized groups more specifically [21]. They additionally report heightened threat perceptions of issues related to climate change, participate in more pro-climate actions in their daily lives, and contribute larger donations to pro-environmental causes in the laboratory [22, 23]. Similar to how they extend moral regard across social and temporal boundaries, longtermists extend greater moral consideration to entities within the natural environment as well, including non-human animals, rainforests, and coral reefs [20, 24], providing further support for the connection between substantial levels of intergenerational concern and pro-environmentalism.\nThe pro-environmental tendencies of longtermists are, in part, explained by their increased ability to envision a more sustainable future and generate a greater variety of environmental alternatives compared to non-longtermists [21]. These factors are closely linked to pro-environmental engagement in the broader population as well [26, 54-56]. These findings may reflect a heightened imaginative capacity in longtermists to transcend the here and now and more vividly represent distal futures in the mind's eye (see Episodic Future Thinking [57-60]). Moreover, longtermists exhibit elevated concerns about their own futures, specifically with regard to leaving behind a positive legacy [20-22, 34], another factor long recognized as a crucial motivator for environmental action [25, 35, 36, 61-63].\nLongtermist beliefs (i.e., endorsing a sense of impartial intergenerational beneficence) and pro-environmental behavior may be informed by extant literature on generative concern. People who are worried about the well-being of future generations are considered to be high in generative concern [64, 65]. Researchers have linked generative concern to environmentalism, finding that emerging adults who score high on measures of generative concern at ages 23 and 26 reported stronger environmental identity, as well as greater pro-environmental attitudes and engagement in pro-environmental behavior at age 32 [64]. Further, when these emerging adults exhibited increased growth in generative concern between ages 23-32, they were more likely to share narratives about their environmental identity which were coded as being more personally meaningful, detailed, and having a stronger influence on their commitment to continued environmental involvement [66]. In other work, people who scored high in generativity were also more likely to report environmental concern and green purchasing behavior [67]. However, generativity, as measured in these studies and other work on generative concern using the Loyola Generativity Scale (LGS [65], ), can be distinguished from longtermism because it includes more than intergenerational concern. The LGS contains sixteen items, but only three of these items measure beliefs about the impacts one can have on others after their death (i.e., in the long term), along with other items measuring commitments to others, creativity, and desire to mentor children [65]. Thus, while we expect that longtermism will exhibit similar relationships to environmentalism as generativity, studying the specific influence of intense intergenerational concern is important.\nHowever, despite extensive research examining the connection between intergenerational concern and climate-related attitudes and actions, a crucial and unanswered question remains: Do individuals with substantial levels of intergenerational concern cope with and emotionally react differently from members of the general population to escalating threats associated with climate change? The theoretical foundations underlying and emerging research into the psychology of longtermism hints at this possibility. For instance, longtermists actively take actions in their lives to (1) combat climate related threats [21, 34] and (2) safeguard the welfare of future generations [20-24, 34]. These findings allude to the possibility that longtermists may employ more proactive rather than avoidant coping strategies when dealing with climate change-related distress, taking practical steps to manage and mitigate the source of their concerns [5-7, 9].\nLikewise, longtermists' elevated pro-environmental engagement may be owed in part to their emotional reactions to climate change. For instance, it's plausible that longtermists may encounter heightened negative emotions such as anxiety, anger, or guilt (see [8, 68]), when faced with climate-related challenges and when reflecting on the legacies they will leave behind. These negative emotions, in turn, could serve as a driving force behind their proactive engagement and action-oriented approach to addressing climate-related issues. Yet, longtermists also have the capacity for elevated optimism when looking towards the future, as evidenced by their ability to envision more sustainable environmental alternatives [69]. This observation could provide insight into why potentially negative emotional responses to climate change do not lead to hopelessness or avoidance, but instead drive action among individuals with substantial levels of intergenerational concern. Nonetheless, since a comprehensive study directly comparing the climate change-related coping mechanisms and emotional responses of longtermists with those of the general population has not yet been conducted, these questions remain unanswered and warrant investigation. The extensive body of literature on coping strategies and emotional reactions in the context of climate change serves to supplement what is known from the burgeoning literature on intergenerational concern and longtermism beliefs in guiding the present research.\nCoping with and emotional reactions to climate change\nCoping refers to the different behavioral and cognitive strategies people use to deal with stress [70]. When we refer to coping with climate change, we are referring to the ways that people who feel worried about climate change respond to those feelings- whether they ignore the problem, express denial, and discount the threat (avoidant coping) or try to find ways to tackle the problem and directly engage with the issue (active coping). While we can broadly categorize coping strategies as being avoidant or active, researchers also describe coping based on its focus (e.g., meaning-focused, problem-focused, emotion-focused [70],. When we consider the stressors associated with climate change and the scale of the issue, it has been argued that successful coping will likely include a mix of strategies [71]- some strategies involving proenvironmental engagement, and some that help people to cope with their own emotional responses to the existential threat of climate change. For example, Ojala [9] found that, among youth, engaging in problem-focused active coping was associated with greater negative affect, but this relationship was attenuated when the youth also engaged in meaning-focused coping (e.g., positive reframing). The ways that people choose to cope with the threat of climate change have important implications for their own well-being and the environment. While it is important for people to find ways to manage their emotional responses to climate change, it is also necessary for people to take the actions that they can to address climate change through their own behavior [71].\nWhile work on the link between coping strategies to proenvironmental behavior is sparse, there is some evidence that people who report coping actively with climate change also report greater engagement with proenvironmental behaviors [72]. However, past work has also found that people who report using more avoidant strategies also engage in proenvironmental behaviors. As long as people are saying they are coping in some form, greater concern translates to behavior [72]. Ojala [73] found that adolescents who report greater meaning-focused coping are more likely to report greater pro-environmental behavior, and that those who reported more de-emphasizing coping (e.g., telling themselves the problem is over-exaggerated) were significantly less likely to report proenvironmental engagement. Although more research is needed on the link between coping and proenvironmental behavior, particularly work measuring proenvironmental behavior via observation, it seems likely that people who report greater coping with climate change, especially in more approach-oriented ways, are more likely to engage in proenvironmental behavior as a means managing their stress.\nFor longtermists, we might expect that concern about climate change, combined with propensity for prosociality, may lead to active forms of coping. Longtermists, namely, individuals who are exceptional in their intergenerational concern, feel a sense of responsibility to future generations; thus, we would expect that avoidant forms of coping, like denial or disengagement with the issue, would be contrary to their values. In previous work, people who express greater concern for their legacy-having an impact on the future beyond their lifespan-tended to report greater engagement in active forms of coping with climate change, and more proenvironmental behavior [74]. These findings would lend support to a prediction that longtermists would be more likely to engage in active coping with climate change-related stress, because longtermists strongly endorse legacy motives [20-22, 34].\nAnother aspect of longtermism is the ability to generate environmental cognitive alternatives (ECAs). Having a sense of hope and optimism about the future and being able to imagine the possibility of humankind adapting to climate change is likely necessary to maintain long-term engagement with the issue of climate change and also to maintain personal well-being [54, 56]. Indeed, being able to make meaning in spite of the magnitude of climate change challenges attenuates the negative relationship between problem-focused coping and well-being [73]. People who express greater motivation to leave a positive legacy also report a greater sense of constructive hope about climate change, and less hope based in denial [74]. Thus, we would expect that, because they feel a greater sense of hope and less powerlessness, longtermists will be better able to generate ECAs than controls. It is likely also the case that people who are better able to imagine an alternative future in turn feel more power to achieve that future and thus feel greater hope.\nFinally, the stress and concern that people feel about climate change may take different forms: grief, anger, guilt and worry. While some level of emotional response is likely needed to motivate engagement with climate change, there is also evidence that, if these emotions are too strong, it could be maladaptive [75]. For example, eco-anxiety is associated with more pro-environmental behavior, but poorer mental health [76]. Anger often motivates collective action generally [77], and this has also been found when measuring eco-anger [78]. There are many different kinds of guilt a person can feel associated with climate change (e.g., a sense of collective guilt due to feeling complicit in a system that causes climate change vs. criticism of one's actions [79],. Inducing guilt about climate change can motivate action [80]. However, it has been theorized that, for certain people, feelings of guilt underlie a propensity to deny human-caused climate change [81]. Longtermists may feel both more anger about climate change-a perceived failure to safeguard the future-and more guilt from feeling complicit in the systems which cause climate change.\nMoreover, sadness about climate change, sometimes termed ecological grief, takes many forms [82]. One form of this grief is associated with concerns about anticipated losses, those that have not yet occurred but that are likely to without action [82, 83]. For longtermists, it is likely that one of the feelings they have about climate change is a sense of loss and grief for the future, as long as they believe it poses tangible existential risk. While we might expect that feelings of sadness and depression around climate change could lead to withdrawal from or avoidance of the issue, some research suggests that people who express greater eco-depression also engage in collective action around climate change [78]. One of the objectives of the present investigation is to better understand to what extent longtermists express each of these kinds of emotions.\nCurrent studies\nBuilding upon the aforementioned theoretical rationale and existing findings [20-24, 34], we hypothesize first and foremost, that longtermists will report significantly higher legacy concerns (H1), and a greater ability to generate environmental cognitive alternatives (H2), compared to non-longtermists in the general population. In addition, we hypothesize that, because climate change is itself an extinction risk, longtermists will feel more angry about inaction for climate change (H3a), less climate contempt-feelings of disregard for the issue of climate change (H3b), more hope/enthusiasm that climate change can be addressed (H3c), less powerlessness about the scope of the threat (H3d), more guilt about not doing enough to address climate change (H3e), as well as more anxiety resulting from (H3f), and sorrow regarding (H3g) climate change.\nImportantly, we have varied predictions regarding how longtermists versus general population controls will score on how isolated they feel from others regarding their opinion about climate change. On the one hand, it's possible that longtermists may, on account of climate change representing an extinction threat, perceive their care regarding climate change as being higher than average, and consequently feel greater isolation. On the other hand, longtermists may overestimate normative alignment with their own climate change attitudes and feel less isolation compared to general population controls as a result.\nFinally, because longtermists are more concerned about and more likely to take active steps to address climate change [21, 34], and because they seek to protect future generations [20-24, 34], we hypothesize that they will score higher on problem-focused (H3h) and meaning-focused (H3i) coping and lower on avoidant coping with climate change (H3j).\nExtending this hypothesis further, we expect that higher scores in legacy concerns and ability to generate environmental cognitive alternatives will relate to more climate change-related anger (H4a-H4b), less contempt (H5a-H5b), more climate hope/enthusiasm (H6a-H6b), less climate powerlessness (H7a-H7b), more climate guilt (H8a-H8b), more climate anxiety (H9a-H9b), more problem-focused coping (H10a-H10b), more meaning-focused coping (H11a-H11b), and less avoidant-coping (H12a-H12b). Finally, because of H1-H12, we also expect significant indirect effects of longtermism matching the aforementioned directional associations on climate emotions via higher legacy concerns and environmental cognitive alternatives as simultaneous mediators (H13). These hypotheses, together with all analytical decisions, were pre-registered on AsPredicted, https://aspredicted.org/JPK_Q37.

        "methodology": "Method\nAll experimental protocols were approved obtained IRB approval by Boston College Institutional Review Board, Protocol #12.064.01. All participants were informed about the study and then consented to participating in it. This was completed at the beginning of the survey.\nParticipants\nA total of 800 participants were recruited via Prolific, an online platform that allows participants to complete surveys in exchange for financial remuneration. Per our pre-registration protocol we removed participants who had duplicate IP addresses (N = 12) and participants who missed our attention check (a multiple choice question asking them to select a particular response; N = 17). A total of 771 participants remained (M age = 40.51, SD age = 13.45), of whom 385 (49.9%) were male, 369 (47.9%) female, 17 (2.2%) neither male nor female, 565 (73.2%) white, 116 (15.0%) Black or African American, and 38 (4.9%) Asian. The average perceived socioeconomic status (SES) was 5.02 (SD = 1.76) on a scale of 1-10, and the average political ideology was 3.29 (SD = 1.78) on a scale of 1-7, with higher scores reflecting stronger conservatism.\nMaterials and procedure\nMeasures were grouped based on their role (predictor, mediators, outcomes) and shown to participants in a randomized order.\nPredictor: longtermism beliefs\nLongtermism beliefs were captured with the 28-item (a = 0.97) Longtermism Beliefs Scale [22]. The scale consists of seven statements, which are repeated with reference to four different timeframes/timepoints (1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 years in the future). Scores are captured on slider scales ranging from 0 = strongly disagree- 100 = strongly agree. Per the proposed methodology, participants are classified as longtermists if they score above 75 for the closest temporal timeframe (1,000 years), and they have the same score, or higher for future timeframes (i.e., 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 years in the future).\nMediator: legacy concerns\nLegacy concerns were captured using three items from Zaval and colleagues [25], measured on 7-point Likert scale (a = 0.89).\nMediator: environmental cognitive alternatives\nEnvironmental cognitive alternatives (ECAS) were captured with 10 items (a = 0.93) from Wright and colleagues [26] measured on a 7-point Likert scale.\nOutcome: climate change coping\nThree different methods of coping with climate change were measured. These were problem-focused coping (a = 0.90), meaning-focused coping (a = 0.79), and avoidant coping (a = 0.87). These measures were taken directly or adapted from Ojala [9]. Each method of coping was measured with 5 items, each measured on a 7-point Likert scale. The full set of items can be found in the SOM.\nOutcome: climate change emotions\nOur goal was to capture a broadest possible array of emotional reactions to climate change, including both constructive emotional reactions with positive valence (e.g., hope) as well as reactions with a more negative valence (e.g., contempt). To that end, we utilized a tool that was recently developed by researchers to comprehensively assess the full breadth of possible emotional reactions to climate change (see [8]). Specifically, we measured climate change-related anger (a = 0.96), contempt (a = 0.94), hope/enthusiasm (a = 0.93), powerlessness (a = 0.84), guilt (a = 0.95), anxiety (a = 0.92), sorrow (a = 0.95), and isolation (a = 0.91), which span the spectrum of affective valence. Participants responded to four items per emotion on a 7-point Likert scale.",

        "results": "Results\nAll analyses were conducted in SAS. Correlations were estimated with the proc corr command, t-tests with the proc ttest command, regression with the proc reg command, and indirect effect tests using the PROCESS Macro, with 10,000 bootstrapped samples.\nCorrelations\nAs hypothesized (see Table 1) higher longtermism beliefs related to increased legacy concerns and ECAs. Each of these three measures related to decreased avoidant coping, increased problem-focused and meaning-based coping with climate change. Coping styles that were actively acknowledging climate change and focused on ways to address the issue rather than avoid it, Longtermism beliefs, legacy concerns and ECAs related to increased hope, anger, guilt, anxiety, sorrow, isolation and decreased contempt. No significant association was found with powerlessness except for ECAs, which negatively related to powerlessness.\nTable 1:\nPearson's correlations between all measures\nDifferences based on longtermist identification\nOf the 771 participants, a total of 185 (24%) scored in the longtermist pattern, showing high intergenerational concern. Specifically, longtermists (M = 92.78, SD = 6.34) scored significantly higher (t (761.73) = 41.89, p <.001, d = 2.63) than the rest of the sample (M = 48.87, SD = 22.73) in longtermism beliefs, suggesting that they were considerably higher in their perception that future people deserve moral rights and that we can influence their lives. All results were robust to the inclusion of age, gender, socioeconomic status and political ideology as covariates (i.e., results remained significant and in the same direction). For these analyses, see the Supplementary Online Materials (SOM).\nMediators\nSupporting our hypothesis, longtermists scored significantly higher in legacy concerns and ECAS compared to non-longtermists (see Table 2; Fig. 1).\nFig. 1:\nPlots depicting legacy concerns (a ), and environmental cognitive alternatives (b ) for longtermists and general population controls.

Further, they expressed significantly less contempt. Contrary to our hypothesis, no significant difference was noted for powerlessness. For isolation, we had contrasting hypotheses. The results suggested that longtermists felt more isolation compared to controls, possibly due their elevated concern for the issue relative to the rest of the population (See Table 2; Fig. 2).\nFig. 2:\nPlots depicting anger (a ), guilt (b ), anxiety (c ), sorrow (d ), hope (e ), contempt (f ), powerlessness (g ), and isolation (h ) for longtermists and general population controls.

We had competing hypotheses for isolation, but, given the results for longtermism, the pattern for the proposed mediators were in line the previous results, such that both legacy concerns and ECAS related to increased isolation. Importantly, these results remained significant, and in the same direction when controlling for age, gender, socioeconomic status and political ideology (see Table S2 in SOM).\nTable 3:\nLinear regressions with legacy concerns and ECAS as predictors of all focal outcomes\nIndirect effects\nBased on the aforementioned theoretical rationale, and our pre-registered expectation for a significant indirect effect of longtermism on the different coping methods and emotional reactions to climate change, we estimated several indirect effects with longtermist identification as the predictor (binary variable; 1 = longtermist, 0 = non-longtermist), legacy concerns and ECAS as parallel mediators, and each outcome of interest as the focal outcome in each model. We used the PROCESS Macro [84], Model 4 (mediation with parallel mediators), with 10,000 bootstrapped samples.\nIn all models (see Table 4), longtermist identification predicted significantly higher legacy concerns (b = 0.72, 95% C.I. [0.50, 0.94], R 2 = 0.05) and ECAS (b = 0.60, 95% C.I. [0.38, 0.82], R 2 = 0.04). Even after controlling for legacy concerns and ECAS, being a longtermist predicted significantly higher scores for problem-focused coping, anger, guilt, sorrow, and anxiety for climate change, and significantly lower scores for contempt and avoidant coping, suggesting that legacy concerns and ECAS only partially mediate the effect of longtermism for these outcomes. However, for meaning-based coping and hope, the effect of longtermism was not significant after including the mediators. In turn, higher legacy concerns and ECAS related to increased problem-focused and meaning-based coping, hope, guilt, anger, isolation, anxiety, and sorrow, while ECAS specifically also related to decreased avoidant coping, and contempt. For powerlessness, legacy concerns had a positive association while ECAs a negative. Finally, significant indirect effects for both legacy concerns and ECAS emerged for problem-focused and meaning-based coping, anger, hope, powerlessness, guilt, isolation, anxiety, and sorrow. ECAS also mediated the effect of longtermism for avoidant coping and contempt. Results were for the most part consistent after accounting for the aforementioned demographic covariates, as all indirect effects except for the effect via ECAS for avoidant coping, remained significant and in the same direction (see Table S3 in SOM).\nTable 4:\nIndirect effects test with longtermist identification as the exogenous variable, legacy concerns and ECAS as parallel mediators",
        "limitations": "Limitations and future directions\nWhile the current study represents an initial exploration of the positive relationship that intergenerational concern has with climate-related coping and emotional responses, it is important to acknowledge several limitations and areas that warrant further investigation and exploration. For instance, the analyses in the current study are correlational, which means that the directionality and causal nature of the relationships under examination remain subject to further investigation. On the one hand, it is possible that intergenerational concern precedes and influences coping strategies and emotional responses to climate change. It is equally plausible that individuals' coping mechanisms and emotional reactions to climate challenges may, in turn, shape the level of concern they feel toward safeguarding future generations from these threats. These potential causal relationships should be explored in future research that directly manipulates intergenerational concern. Previous research has demonstrated that low-cost and short-duration interventions can effectively promote intergenerational attitudes and actions [23, 34, 36, 61].\nFurthermore, future research could consider applying the current framework within a longitudinal context. Given that coping mechanisms are designed to alleviate negative emotional states, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the proactive coping strategies used by individuals with heightened intergenerational concern might effectively mitigate the feelings of anger, guilt, and anxiety they experience in response to climate challenges over time. Longitudinal studies could provide valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of coping and emotional reactions in relation to climate change. Notably, while this study has shed light on the connections between intergenerational concern, coping strategies, and emotional responses, it has yet to establish a direct link between coping mechanisms and climate actions. Future research endeavors may bridge this gap by investigating how specific coping strategies translate into concrete pro-environmental behaviors and actions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between emotional reactions, coping, and climate-related engagement.\nAnother area ripe for further investigation is the variance that persists between intergenerational concern and the outcomes. While our study has uncovered evidence suggesting that legacy concerns and environmental cognitive alternatives (ECAs) account for a portion of the variance in these relationships, there remains unexplained variance that calls for deeper exploration. Future research can explore additional factors and mechanisms that contribute to the complex relationship between intergenerational concern and outcomes related to coping and emotional reactions, offering a more comprehensive understanding of these dynamics.\nAs an example, longtermists exhibit heightened levels of future self-continuity, indicating a strong sense of identity with their future selves, and tend to carefully contemplate the consequences of their actions [88]. These variables are well-established predictors of forward-thinking behaviors aimed at safeguarding not only one's own future but also the future well-being of others [89-99, 99]. Moreover, longtermists engage in greater utopian thinking, and report a greater vividness when envisioning the distant future compared to general population controls, characteristics that contribute to intergenerational and pro-environmental concerns [20, 54, 55, 58, 59, 69]. Given the relevance of these additional factors, they merit consideration as candidate mechanisms that could help bridge the gap between intergenerational concern and coping strategies, as well as emotional reactions in the context of climate change.\nLastly, it's essential to acknowledge that the current study is based on a sample from the United States. Future research endeavors should aim to replicate and extend the findings presented here in an international context. Examining these relationships across diverse cultural and geographic settings may help uncover valuable insights into the universality or cultural specificity of the observed patterns, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of intergenerational concern and its implications for climate-related coping and emotional responses on a global scale. For instance, prior research has found that countries with cultures embodying a long-term orientation and with greater intergenerational solidarity score higher on numerous metrics of environmental performance [100]. Moreover, citizens of these countries are more concerned about the negative effects of climate change. What stands to be addressed in future research is whether national differences in temporal perspective predict variation in coping with and emotional reactions to climate change, in turn facilitating greater proenvironmental engagement.\nConclusion\nClimate change impacts are already occurring but will be catastrophic for future generations without intervention. Longtermists, and those with high levels of intergenerational concern more broadly, represent a group of people who are particularly concerned about future generations. This intergenerational concern does not appear to paralyze them or prevent engagement with the issue; in fact, we find that longtermists are able to feel hopeful in spite of the challenges and engage in proactive coping strategies to address climate change.\nAcknowledgements: We have no acknowledgements to make.\nCorrespondence:\nAuthor details: 1 https://ror.org/02n2fzt79, grid.208226.c, 0000 0004 0444 7053, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Boston College, , Chestnut Hill, MA, USA. 2 https://ror.org/02n2fzt79, grid.208226.c, 0000 0004 0444 7053, The Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society, Boston College, , Chestnut Hill, MA, USA. 3 https://ror.org/012zs8222, grid.265850.c, 0000 0001 2151 7947, Department of Psychology, University at Albany, State University of New York Albany, , Albany, NY, USA. 4 https://ror.org/0072zz521, grid.266683.f, 0000 0001 2166 5835, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst, , Amherst, MA, USA.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nAs climate change-related threats become more pronounced [1-4], researchers are now extending their focus beyond the physical environment to examine their impact on the mental health of individuals within it [5-11]. This research highlights not only that climate change impacts mental health, but that resulting coping strategies and emotional reactions are a critical driver of pro-environmental engagement. Despite extensive research demonstrating that intergenerational concern, as assessed by high scores on the Longtermism Beliefs Scale (LBS) [22], correlates with pro-environmental engagement [23, 69] and forward-thinking attitudes and behaviors aimed at safeguarding the well-being of future generations [20-24, 34], the precise impact of intergenerational concern on coping strategies and emotional reactions to climate change remains a critically unexplored area of study [masked for review]. The present study represents a first pass at testing the novel hypothesis that intergenerational concern serves the adaptive function of not only promoting attitudes and actions towards mitigating the deleterious effects of climate change on the natural environment, but also promoting proactive coping strategies towards mitigating its adverse effects on psychological well-being.\nIn this study, we delved into the climate change-related coping strategies [5-7, 9] and emotional reactions [8, 68] of empirically-identified longtermists, individuals who exhibit exceptionally strong intergenerational concern. Our findings revealed that longtermists tend to employ problem-focused (i.e., directing one's effort and attention directly toward actively addressing the specific problem or stressor they are facing) and meaning-based (i.e., finding or creating meaning and purpose in difficult or challenging situations) coping strategies more frequently while relying less on avoidant coping strategies (i.e., engaging in efforts to distance oneself from a stressor) when confronted with climate change-related challenges. Intriguingly, despite experiencing emotions such as guilt, anger, sorrow, and a sense of isolation in response to climate change, longtermists also reported feeling a distinct sense of hope about the future, aligning with work which underscores the utility of emotional complexity in driving collective action [85].\nThe emotional responses we observed were in line with what we would expect for a group of people characterized by robust concern for the distant future. Having feelings about climate change (regardless of the valence) is indicative of involvement with the issue rather than avoidance. Longtermists care about the issue of climate change, and that care and concern manifest in their emotional engagement. While previous research has suggested that there is a level of emotional response needed to motivate action, experiencing worry too strongly could result in avoidance [75]. Yet, even among those who are experiencing strong negative emotions, maintaining a sense of hope and being able to make meaning represent one way of safeguarding well-being [73]. Longtermists appear to be especially good at maintaining hope. However, understanding how and why longtermists foster hope, and the intricate relationships between different emotions over time requires further study.\nThese observed patterns in coping and emotional responses were further elucidated by two key factors. First, longtermists' heightened concerns about the legacy they will leave behind played a crucial role in driving their problem-focused and meaning-based coping strategies. These findings align with an extensive body of literature linking legacy motivations to proenvironmental attitudes and action [25, 35, 36, 61, 61-63, 86, 87] as well as intergenerational concern [20-22, 34]. Yet the present findings build upon this existing literature by demonstrating that legacy motivations simultaneously mitigate the impact of climate change on well-being. Second, longtermists' enhanced ability to generate alternative solutions and perspectives regarding environmental issues, referred to as environmental cognitive alternatives (ECAs), contributed significantly to their positive outlook and adaptive coping mechanisms in the face of climate change. Similar to legacy motivations, ECAs have been shown to predict pro-environmental and otherwise farsighted attitudes and actions [26, 56]. Nonetheless, the present study is the first to connect this factor to climate-related coping and emotionality.\nIn summary, the present findings show that individuals with a strong sense of intergenerational concern experience a mix of emotions when it comes to climate change. They often grapple with feelings of anger, guilt, and anxiety in response to the climate crisis. However, in contrast to these negative emotions, they also maintain a sense of hope about the future, taking direct actions to address the challenges posed by climate change (problem-focused coping), actively engaging with the issue and seeking solutions. Simultaneously, they find meaning and purpose in their efforts, not losing faith in others or humanity as a whole (meaning-focused coping). Importantly, they do not resort to avoidant coping, which involves avoiding or ignoring the issue altogether. Instead, they confront climate change head-on, driven by their ability to envision of a more sustainable future and strong desire to leave behind a positive and lasting legacy. By instilling values that highlight intergenerational concern as a key priority, we may be able not only to increase pro-climate action, but also to help individuals actively and constructively cope with changes produced by climate change.",

        "introduction": "Background\nGlobally, an estimated 14% of adults live with migraine disease which impacts their physical, emotional and social wellbeing. To target the disease comprehensively, research recommends a multidisciplinary approach to migraine management. Yet, at present, migraine management primarily centers around pharmaceutical treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which emotional awareness could influence the uptake of self-care behaviours of community-dwelling adults with migraine.\nBackground\nChronic pain, defined as pain that persists or recurs for longer than three months [1], affects a quarter of the UK population [2]. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 recognised the high prevalence of pain and pain-related disease as a major contributor to disability and disease burden worldwide [3]. Chronic pain has been shown to have a significant impact on people's overall quality of life [4].This significant impact can also be found in headache disorders, which are among the most common diseases worldwide. Migraine, a primary headache disorder, is one of the leading causes of years lived with disability among adults [5]. The estimated global prevalence of migraine is 14% in adults [6]. Aside from debilitating physical symptoms, migraine has a significant impact on a person's daily functioning, quality of life, social and emotional wellbeing, employment and family life [7-10].\nOver the past century, our understanding of and perspective on chronic pain has shifted from a biomedical perspective which regards pain as an objective physical event, to a biopsychosocial perspective which considers the interplay of physiological, psychological, social, cognitive and behavioural factors present in an individual's pain experience [11]. While certain contributing factors in chronic pain are deemed non-modifiable (i.e., age, sex, history of trauma or injury, or heritable/genetic factors) other modifiable contributing factors play an important role including pain, mental health, physical activity, sleep and nutrition [12]. In addition to genetic predisposition, behavioural and psychological traits may adversely affect the progression of the disease and how pain is processed [13]. Self-management behaviours and lifestyle modification targeting sleep, diet, stress or the work environment could offer a significant contribution to the experience and trajectory of chronic pain [12, 13]. Migraine is often influenced by comorbidities such as back pain, anxiety and depression or diabetes, as well as individual psychological characteristics. A management approach addressing migraine and simultaneously comorbidities is considered to positively impact the outcome on the individual's health status. However, also in individuals free of psychiatric comorbidities, specific behavioural and psychological factors might occur which need to be addressed for improved management [14, 15].\nInternationally, guidelines for migraine treatment support this multidisciplinary approach, which includes a combination of acute and preventative pharmacological treatment, lifestyle modification and the use of evidence-based behavioural interventions [16, 17]. The routine use of these self-care techniques and behavioural interventions in headache management is low due to factors such as missing knowledge among healthcare professionals [18]. Additionally, headache patients consider behavioural interventions only suitable for those who have previously not benefited from pharmacological treatment options or have high-severity symptoms [18]. Across migraine management, the sustained adoption and adherence to lifestyle or behavioural modifications, including nutrition or use of medication, pose challenges [19, 20]. To address this, several dimensions of self-care which act on the health system level and individual need to be considered, which can be broadly grouped into [1] self-care activities (self-awareness, health literacy) and [2] self-care behaviours (delivery, activation, and behaviour change) [21]. In the case of migraine, as with the management of other chronic conditions, self-care activities and behaviours are primarily centred around physical symptoms of pain, whereas behaviours including a doctor's visit or taking a pill are considered to be responses to physical pain [22].\nFrom the biopsychosocial perspective of chronic pain, this one-sided approach lacks the integration of emotional and social factors and the influence this would have on the choice of self-care activities and behaviours which should be present to address acute and non-pain situations. Using personal mood and emotion-tracking smartphone applications can increase an individual's emotional awareness [23]. In the case of migraine sufferers, using mood diaries and emotion tracking could help them become more aware of their emotions and would be more likely to react to them using self-management approaches. Available support for self-management of migraine, including the use of headache- or migraine-tracking apps, follow this approach but traditionally favour the tracking of physical symptoms of migraine over the impact of emotions in their assessment [24, 25]. Further, while these apps may enhance the recording of and the user's reflection on emotions, they do not routinely provide guidance for behavioural responses to emotions and social situations [26].\nStudy objectives\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the perceived efficacy of preventative and acute self-care techniques currently used by migraine patients. We also sought to examine the extent to which emotional factors are integrated into the choice or management of migraine.",
        "methodology": "Methods\nA cross-sectional online survey explored personal experiences with migraine disease and strategies or behaviours to manage migraine attacks. Chi-squared tests were used to investigate differences in ratings of migraine prevention and management strategies between users and non-users of the strategies. Univariable logistic regressions were used to assess the effectiveness of self-care behaviours to manage or prevent migraine attacks.\nMethods\nStudy design\nWe conducted a descriptive cross-sectional online survey of migraine sufferers using purposive sampling. The electronic survey published on the Imperial College London Qualtrics platform was open for 8 months (July 2021 to February 2022) and could be accessed by anyone with the link. Information about the study was shared with migraine charities as well as through the personal networks of the co-investigators. Initial contact was not made with respondents prior to this email. Study information inviting individuals to contribute to a study that investigated the extent to which emotional awareness influences self-care behaviours of adults with migraine was disseminated, including the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and link to the survey. Inclusion criteria were only validated in the survey asking participants if they had migraine disease. We did not specify diagnosis by a neurologist or self-diagnosis nor a specific type of migraine as exclusion criteria. The researchers' personal and professional networks were also mobilised to respond and further disseminate the eSurvey among eligible participants. The PIS included information regarding the study's aims, the protection of participants' personal data, their right to withdraw from the study at any time, which data were stored, where and for how long, who the investigator was, and the purpose of the study and survey length. Participants were informed that this was a voluntary survey without any monetary incentives. We highlighted that their participation offered collective benefits by advancing knowledge in the area. We offered participants access to the study findings at a later stage.\nElectronic survey\nThe Qualtrics survey (Version XM) contained a total of 26 questions displayed on one page. The Qualtrics website has first-party cookies and allows third parties to place cookies on devices and automatically capture responses. The survey was accessible using a personal computer or smartphone to anyone with a link (open survey). Questions regarding the demographic characteristics of the users included information on gender, age, ethnicity, educational level, marital status, country of residence and employment status. Participants could review their answers before submitting them. All data collected through the survey were anonymised and not personally identifiable. The online survey's technical functionality and usability were tested and piloted with a small group of individuals before being published. Participation in the survey was voluntary, and consent to participate in the study was sought in the first question of the survey.\nThe survey contained conditional questions that appeared if the respondent stated they track their emotional and/or physical wellbeing and symptoms so that they could input further information about their personal experiences. Single-choice questions evaluated the participants' experience with migraine disease (e.g., frequency or type). Personal self-care techniques for migraine attack prevention and acute management were evaluated in multiple-choice questions with common self-care techniques as suggested answer options. Participants were asked to state the extent to which they thought the listed self-care techniques were effective. Additional questions explored the participants' perception of how emotional wellbeing was related to their migraine disease and its management and whether they tracked their physical and emotional wellbeing. The survey is included in Supplementary File 1.\nData handling\nThe data collected were stored on the password-protected Imperial College London secure database, and only the team researchers could access the eSurvey results. Data were cleaned to exclude respondents who did not provide tick-box consent, or who exited without submitting their response. Non-submitted responses were excluded as these lacked answers to key questions on participant demographics and experience, prevention, or management of migraines. IP addresses of survey responses indicated no duplicated participants.",
        "analysis": "Statistical analysis\nRespondent characteristics were described using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and median with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables. Chi-squared tests were conducted to explore potential associations between ratings of each prevention and management strategy and being a user of the strategy. The Holm correction for multiple tests was applied to the resulting p -values of statistical tests. An adjusted p -value < 0.05 denoted statistical significance. All analyses were performed using R version 4.1.2. The quality of the survey was assessed by completing the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) [27].\nEthics\nThe study received a favourable opinion from Imperial College Research Ethics Committee (ICREC # 21IC6990). Participants consented to take part in the survey.\nPatient and public involvement\nNo patient was involved.",
        "results": "Results\nWe surveyed 170 community-dwelling adults with migraine in the United Kingdom, Austria, Germany and the United States. Most (85%) respondents had experienced migraine for over five years, where 42% of attacks usually lasted several days. Whereas we did not differentiate between diagnosis by a neurologist or self-diagnosis, the most common diagnoses in the cohort were migraine without aura (38.9%) and migraine with aura (29%). Staying hydrated was the most popular preventative strategy (87%), 70.2% used prescription medication and 64.9% changed their diet and/or supplements. Almost all ( 92.4%) respondents stated that their mood or emotions could trigger their migraine attacks. Keeping a headache or mood diary was the lowest-rated prevention strategy and was rated as \"probably ineffective\" or causing \"no change\" in preventing migraine attacks. Over a third (39.7%) kept track of their physical wellbeing and symptoms. Reasons stated for tracking symptoms included to identify triggers (65.8%), show reports to a healthcare professional (59.6%), understand when they must take medication (48.1%), track improvements (67.3%) or deteriorations (67.3%).\nResults\nDemographic profile of respondents\nThe electronic survey received 170 total responses. Only 131 (77.1%) of the total responses were complete, emanating from the United Kingdom (84.0%), Germany (2.3%), Austria (1.5%) and the United States (12.2%); Table 1. The majority (92.4%) of respondents were female. Respondents had a median age of 39 years (IQR 29 - 51) with a range of 18 to 74 years. Eighty-three percent were educated to a university degree or higher, and 60.3% were employed. More than half (51.9%) were married, 20.6% were in a domestic relationship, and 17.6% were single. The majority (90.8%) identified as white ethnic background.\nTable 1:\nRespondent characteristics\nMigraine characteristics and impact\nEighty-nine percent of respondents had experienced migraine for over five years. Whereas 26% of respondents experienced migraine once or twice per week, 26% once or twice per month, and 3.8% once or twice per year, 44.3% indicated they had chronic migraine (15 + days per month). At the time of survey completion, 77.1% of respondents had experienced their last migraine attack during the last seven days. Migraine attacks usually lasted several days (42.0%), the whole day (35.9%), or over an hour (19.8%). The most common diagnoses in the cohort were migraine with no aura (38.9%) and migraine with aura (29.0%). A quarter (25.2%) indicated they had been diagnosed with a different migraine type or that they did not know the type of migraine they experienced. Respondents were asked to rate on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 is no effect, and 5 is an extreme effect, the extent to which migraine affected their physical, emotional and social wellbeing. An extremely detrimental effect on physical wellbeing with a score of 4 or more was most frequently reported (73.3%), compared to 64.9% for social wellbeing and 59.5% for emotional wellbeing.\nMigraine prevention\nRespondents were divided into \"users\" (Fig. 1) and \"non-users\" (Fig. 2) of each migraine prevention activity based on whether or not they had indicated they used the activity for the prevention of migraine attacks and maintenance of physical and emotional wellbeing. Users of each prevention strategy generally rated them more positively than non-users, except for \"Headache Diary\" which was viewed as ineffective by both users and non-users. Table 2 shows the subjective ratings of all prevention strategies in more detail.\nFig. 1:\nRating of prevention strategies from users. Figure 1 shows the subjective rating of prevention strategies from those who actively use the strategy (= users)\nFig. 2:\nRating of prevention strategies from non-users. Figure 2 shows the subjective rating of prevention strategies from those who have never used or have stopped using the strategy (= non-users)\nTable 2:\nRating of prevention strategies stratified by users and non-users of the strategy\nThe most popular migraine prevention strategy was 'staying hydrated', with 87% of respondents selecting that they partake in the strategy (Fig. 1). The next most popular prevention strategies, in descending order, were taking prescription medication (70.2% of 131 respondents selected), diet changes and/or supplements (64.9%), using migraine relief products (63.4%), and lifestyle adaptations such as regular breaks or avoiding screen time (80%).\nStaying hydrated was the highest-rated strategy by its users with nearly 94% describing it as \"probably effective\". The next best-rated prevention strategies by user rating were lifestyle adaptations and exercise, with 91.3% and 89% of their respective users rating them as \"probably effective\". Keeping a mood diary (3.1%) was the least frequently selected strategy for the prevention of migraine attacks. Keeping a headache or mood diary was the lowest rated (\"probably ineffective\") prevention strategy amongst both users and non-users of the strategies (Figs. 1 and 2).\nAlthough mental health support \"Counselling, Cognitive behavioural therapy, other mental health support\" was the second least frequently selected strategy for migraine prevention (15.3%), it was highly rated by its users, with 75% of respondents who used this strategy (n = 20) describing it as \"probably effective\" at preventing migraine.\nAcute migraine management strategies\nRespondents were divided into \"users\" (Fig. 3) and \"non-users\" (Fig. 4) for each migraine management activity based on whether they used the activity to manage signs and symptoms of migraine when they occur. Most management strategies were rated positively by users, whereas non-users were more often doubtful as to the effectiveness of each strategy. Table 3 shows the subjective ratings of all prevention strategies in more detail.\nFig. 3:\nRating acute management strategies from users. Figure 3 shows the subjective rating of acute management strategies from those who actively use the strategy (= users)\nFig. 4:\nRating acute management strategies from non-users. Figure 4 shows the subjective rating of acute management strategies from those who have never used or have stopped using the strategy (= non-users)\nTable 3:\nRating of acute management strategies stratified by users and non-users of the strategy\nThe most popular acute management strategies by several users were 'staying hydrated' and 'use of migraine relief products', with both being used by 104 (79.4% of 131) users. Taking prescription medication was also popular, with 74.8% of respondents selecting it as a management strategy.\nStaying hydrated and taking prescription medication were the most highly rated management strategies, with 82.7% and 82.7% of their respective users rating them as \"probably effective\" at managing signs and symptoms of migraine in that same order. Using a mood diary to manage signs and symptoms of migraine attacks was the least popular strategy, with only 4 (3.1%) respondents selecting it. Exercise and OTC medication received the highest proportion of \"probably ineffective\" ratings of all management strategies as rated by non-users, users of the strategies much more positively, with 71.9 and 70.9% rating them as \"probably effective\", respectively.\nSelf-tracking of wellbeing and symptoms\nTwenty-two respondents (16.8%) tracked both their physical and emotional wellbeing, whereas 73 (55.7%) stated they neither tracked their physical nor emotional wellbeing and symptoms.\nOver a third (39.7%) of respondents stated they kept track of their physical wellbeing and symptoms. Respondents used the data they collected about their physical wellbeing and symptoms to identify triggers (65.8%), show reports to a healthcare professional (59.6%), understand when they must take medication (48.1%), track improvements (67.3%), or to track deteriorations (67.3%).\nNearly all (92.4%) respondents stated that their mood or emotions could be a trigger for their migraine attacks.\nMood or emotions were a trigger most or all of the time for 36.6% of respondents. Less than a quarter (19.1%) of 131 respondents stated they keep track of their emotional wellbeing and symptoms. Respondents that tracked emotional symptoms often tracked physical symptoms - 88% of respondents who tracked their emotional wellbeing and symptoms also tracked their physical wellbeing and symptoms, but only 42.3% of respondents who tracked their physical wellbeing and symptoms also tracked their emotional wellbeing and symptoms.\nRespondents used the data they collected about their emotional wellbeing and symptoms to identify triggers (76%), show reports to a healthcare professional (44%), understand when they have to improve their emotional wellbeing (72%), track improvements (52%), and track deteriorations (13%). Migraine duration, frequency, and type were not found to be associated with the likelihood of tracking emotional wellbeing and symptoms.",
        "limitations": "Conclusions\nMigraine management is dominated by pharmaceutical management for acute pain attacks and lifestyle changes for managing migraine long-term. Perception of the effectiveness of those techniques is high, whereas perception of interventions that target the emotional or psychological components of chronic pain management (keeping a mood diary, and mental health support) is mixed. There exists a gap between the recommended biopsychosocial approach and the current state of migraine management.\nGraphical Abstract\nKeywords: Migraine, Self-care, Lifestyle change, Lifestyle medicine, Self-management, Headache, Self-care, Prevention, Emotional wellbeing\nAuthor(s): Nicola Filzmoser1 , Iman Webber1 , Gabriele Kerr1 , Aos Alaa1 , Marie Iine El Asmar1 , Manisha Karki1 , Eva Riboli-Sasco1 and Austen El-Osta1\nLimitations\nThe principal limitation of this survey was that 92.4% of survey respondents were women. A reason for this unbalanced gender distribution might be the prevalence of migraine, which current literature shows to be three to four times higher in women than in men. A larger sample in future studies will be important to understand if this effect is due to the sample size instead.\nOverall, the number of participants does not allow for conclusive statements on whether the lack of use of mood diaries and the belief that they are ineffective correlates with a low number of users of mental health services. While many factors such as availability or cost will impact the choice of interventions, a potential area for further investigation is how increased emotional awareness (through e.g., the use of mood diaries) would influence the use of mental health support in migraine prevention and acute management.\nAnother key limitation of this study is related to the small sample size, but it is generally difficult to recruit for such community-facing studies unless migraine patients are approached via the healthcare provider.\nFurther, a convenience sampling strategy was used because we were unsure how many migraine sufferers would respond to the survey. Given that most studies fail because they are unable to recruit the desired sample, convenience sampling was chosen due to its accessibility and time efficiency and this approach is particularly useful for reaching specific groups online, such as migraine communities, and is well-suited for exploratory studies or when resources are limited. As such, we did not seek to perform a power calculation but instead recruited a pragmatic sample primarily due to the exploratory nature of the research, constraints in resources and time, and the need for real-world applicability. This approach allowed for broader inclusivity and greater feasibility, especially in preliminary investigations or when studying novel topics where effect sizes are uncertain. While this decision prioritizes practicality and real-world relevance, we acknowledge that this does not consider potential trade-offs in statistical precision and generalizability. Despite this limitation, we felt that using a pragmatic sample was justifiable given the aims and nature of our study.\nTo enhance the usability of the survey, self-care interventions were grouped within answer options. Follow-up explorations of individual interventions would be necessary. Also, users of prevention/management strategies are likely users because they have found that those strategies work for them. Non-users may be composed of both those who have never tried the strategy and those who have tried the strategy in the past and found it did not work for them and, hence, do not currently use the strategy.\nAdditional focus needs to be placed on the migraine frequency and how it relates to the acceptance of (new) self-care techniques. The burden of migraine disease can differ significantly depending on the frequency of migraine attacks. 3.8% of our respondents experienced migraine attacks once or twice per year whereas 44.3% indicated they had chronic migraine (15 + days per month, 8 of those with migraine symptoms). The impact on lifestyle modifications necessary such as social interactions or regular sleep schedules most likely vary a lot. In our analysis, we did not differentiate based on frequency in measuring the acceptance of self-care techniques. We can assume that those with a higher frequency already have a larger toolkit of migraine management strategies (acute, preventative, or self-care) which potentially could impact the willingness to add new strategies to their management. On the other hand, those with a low frequency might not be willing to engage in new strategies as the impact of the disease might be lower.\nThe topic of using a mood journal was only explored in relation to migraine. Asking for general use of (mood) journals could have given additional insights into patients' behaviour. Due to the low number of respondents who are using emotional diaries, it is difficult to conclude any feedback on their importance or benefit.\nPertinently, such phenotyping of patients can help in designing efficient clinical trials. For example, a patient who is already keeping a diary may not need to be randomized into a self-management intervention which utilizes such methods, and this may help streamline recruitment into the trial.\nImplications\nThe survey analysis suggested that migraine management is currently focused on pharmaceutical interventions and lifestyle changes such as staying hydrated. The aspect of emotional wellbeing is less integrated into patients' current coping and management strategies. However, mental health interventions are subjectively perceived as helpful by respondents, which allows the assumption that awareness is given. Future research would need to explore how this gap between awareness and actual implementation of e.g., mental health support in migraine management arises and how it can be overcome.\nConclusions\nMigraine management is dominated by an over-reliance on pharmaceutical interventions to manage acute pain attacks, whereas lifestyle changes are usually considered as a second option for managing migraine in the long term. Perceptions on the effectiveness of those techniques are high whereas perception of interventions that target the emotional or psychological component of chronic pain management (e.g., keeping a mood diary, and mental health support) are mixed. There exists a gap between what the latest research on chronic pain and migraine management suggests, a bio-psychosocial approach, and the current state of migraine management. Future research is necessary to identify causes and solutions for this gap.\nAbbreviations: CBT: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; IQR: Interquartile range; OTC: Over the counter\nAcknowledgements: The authors thank the National Migraine Centre (London, United Kingdom), the Migraine Association of Ireland (Dublin, Ireland), and UK Pain Relief Foundation (Liverpool, United Kingdom) for disseminating the survey and study information to personal contacts.\nCorrespondence:\nAuthor details: 1 grid.413820.c, 0000 0001 2191 5195, Department of Primary Care & Public Health, Self-Care Academic Research Unit (SCARU) Imperial College London, Charing Cross Hospital, , W6 8RF, London, UK.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that sought to understand the perceived efficacy of preventative and acute self-care techniques currently used by migraine patients, and to examine the extent that emotional factors are integrated into choice or management of migraine. The overall aim of the paper was to investigate the extent that emotional awareness influences self-care behaviours of community-dwelling adults with migraine.\nKey findings\nFocus on physical symptoms\nFindings revealed that participants rated the impact of migraine to be similar on their physical, emotional, and social wellbeing, but this was not reflected in their choice of prevention and acute migraine management strategies, which are mainly focused on treating physical symptoms. The most popular choices of those strategies were staying hydrated or taking prescription medication. This is consistent with the findings of Probyn et al., (2017), which showed that non-pharmacological self-management interventions for migraine are more effective than usual care and in reducing pain intensity, mood and headache-related disability.\nA hypothesis to explain the more positive rating of strategies by users compared to non-users is the difficulty of understanding a strategy's value if you have never used it yourself. Additionally, non-users could consider these strategies as an additional burden to their management.\nBehavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have been shown to be effective in reducing pain, distress, pain behaviour in chronic pain patients and in improving daily functioning [1, 2]. Although in our study only 20 participants reported using mental health support including CBT as a strategy for migraine prevention, it was highly rated as 'probably effective' by users of this self-management technique. Matsuzawa et al. [3] previously explored the barriers to behavioural treatment (e.g., biofeedback, CBT, relaxation techniques) adherence which could be a barrier for the existing target group as well. Further because migraine is known to arise from an interaction between biological, psychological and lifestyle factors, migraine disease puts a physiological and psychological strain on those affected. Psychological factors in particular might aggravate the disease progression, exposing individuals affected to a negative cycle [13].\nBarriers to interventions\nDespite the promising efficacy of behavioural interventions which had fewer side effects than pharmacological treatment, a key barrier to the uptake and adherence to behavioural interventions was related to attitudes and beliefs towards the interventions [3]. Another barrier highlighted was the lack of knowledge or unawareness of headache triggers which could be grouped into a number of categories as follows: [1] 'avoidable' triggers (e.g., alcohol); [2] 'unavoidable and unmanageable' triggers (e.g., weather); and [3] 'unavoidable but manageable' triggers (e.g. stress). Monitoring and managing triggers could help patients increase their headache control which in turn can lead to improved treatment adherence [3].\nRosignoli et al. (2022) [13] highlight that a biopsychosocial approach that considers psychological mechanisms, social and lifestyle factors in addition to biological factors, is already widely used in chronic pain management. However, in migraine management the biomedical approach is dominant. A potential barrier to adopting the approach is the incomplete knowledge of migraine pathophysiology. Additionally, the variability of behavioural interventions for each individual is higher than in pharmacological solutions, leading to difficulty in measuring their effectiveness. The high prevalence of migraine would demand a high level of resources which in the current healthcare system cannot be provided to all individuals with migraine who would require them.\nA recent study from the German Migraine and Headache Society (DMKG) highlighted that headaches show higher impact in individuals with a low socioeconomic status which needs to be further considered in the selection and availability of new management solutions [28].\nUse of a diary to monitor/help prevent migraine\nPertinently, a diary to monitor mood and physical symptoms (e.g., Headache or symptoms) was only used by 67/170 (39.4%) of respondents and this self-care strategy was rated as 'probably effective' by only 35.8% of diary users. Conversely, the use of mood diaries for the prevention of migraine attacks was the least used strategy with only four respondents rating the effectiveness as either 'probably ineffective' or 'no change'. A clear focus is put on tracking physical symptoms, improving one's understanding of emotional or mood factors influencing pain is uncommon and not considered to be an effective management strategy. The recommended biopsychosocial approach to chronic pain, including migraine, management, aims to address physiological as equally psychological, social, cognitive and behavioural factors in a patient's pain experience [4]. Physiological elements are usually managed primarily and tracked in headache diaries by a large number of migraine patients. Mood diaries could further support the biopsychosocial treatment approach by helping patients to learn about mood patterns, hence, being actively able to act to improve their mood [5]. Based on our study findings, we identified that only some diary users consider diaries to be 'probably effective'. However, we did not define what 'probably effective' means in detail for a migraine diary. We can assume that participants rated the strategy in how it was effectively contributing to their migraine management. We cannot draw a conclusion as to whether users find diaries effective in learning about mood patterns. An in-depth analysis is needed to confirm this. An implication for clinical practice would be to use combined diaries that include mood and symptom tracking and show their relationship in summarised reports. This might help patients but also clinicians to understand challenge areas which could be e.g. emotional stressors.",
