        "introduction": "Background\nAnxiety disorders comprise some of the most common mental health conditions. This study examined the global and regional burden of anxiety disorders over the last three decades. The study was designed to help accurately target preventative and management efforts by highlighting trends and high-risk groups. Epidemiological data relating to anxiety disorders from the latest Global Burden of Disease dataset were analyzed to determine the prevalence, incidence, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) rates from 1990 to 2019 for 204 countries and regions.\nBackground",
        "methodology": "Anxiety disorders are biopsychosocial conditions associated with generalized or situation-specific responses to perceived threats [1]. The prevalence of anxiety has attracted significant research interest historically [1-3]. Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders. They generally appear early in life and share, however, with other mental disorders, a deliberately chronic evolution, and a strong functional impact. An increase in global anxiety prevalence represents a significant threat to the population's well-being and quality of life [2]. There are different clinical manifestations of anxiety disorders. For some, it is related to specific environmental stimuli, resulting in phobias [3]. Others may experience severe episodic distress, as in panic disorder [4]. These experiences, when perceived as threats in the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, trigger a fight-or-flight response, which can manifest in the form of a psychophysiological response like dizziness, increased heart rate, and sweating [5]. If left untreated, chronic anxiety can result in many other health issues such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and dementia [6-8]. Existing treatments for anxiety typically involve a combination of medication and psychotherapy [9]. While the physiological response associated with anxiety can be treated via pharmacological methods, the psychological memories and triggers that cause anxiety need a psychological solution. A large body of evidence suggests that psychotherapies like cognitive behavioral therapy are more longitudinally beneficial to individuals with anxiety disorders [5, 10, 11]. Researchers must understand the epidemiological nature of anxiety to identify trends pertaining to demographic factors and more accurately target preventive and management efforts across the population [4].\nDisease epidemiology is critical for understanding population trends, such as whether or not anxiety is increasing, covariates associated with changing trends, and factors involved in the control and management of anxiety disorders. Globally, the considerable variability in prevalence figures could represent a different distribution of risk factors for these disorders. Nevertheless, methodological and cultural factors and the evolution of diagnostic criteria over time probably play an important role. Although epidemiological data are available for many countries, there has been no known recent synthesis of global epidemiological evidence associated with anxiety disorders [11-13]. Differences in reporting and documentation of anxiety internationally can result in misleading information about the actual incidence and causal factors associated with anxiety disorders [14]. A comprehensive epidemiological study of the global burden of anxiety disorders, as well as their sociodemographic associations, is needed to evaluate population-wide trends and potential factors associated with anxiety, as well as to more efficiently target health promotion efforts to reduce the economic and social burden associated with this mental health issue.\nBased on gaps in the literature associated with the epidemiology of anxiety, this study aimed to evaluate the regional and global burden associated with anxiety disorders. Additionally, an examination of forecasts and trends for anxiety disorders was presented based on trends identified in the epidemiological data. A particularly unique contribution of this study was its assessment of annual trends in anxiety disorders via age-standardized rates, which were used to control for the effect of an aging population.\nMethods\nData source\nThe inclusion criteria for the data included prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates associated with anxiety disorders at global, regional, and national levels. Exclusion criteria comprised subnational data like clinic-based records. Anxiety disorder health metrics were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset (see Additional file 1) [15].\nGBD also provides a measure of social/human development, the Social Development Index (SDI) for each country. The SDI is a composite of three factors: education, total fertility rate, and income, and ranges from 0 to 1. The robustness of the GBD dataset stems from its reliance on a wide range of sources like independent studies, government reports, vital registration, healthcare registries, and census-related data [16]. GBD produces reliable estimates of health metrics and has been used in epidemiological studies for other conditions like dementia [16]. The data reliability is ensured by using modeling adjustments to address data sampling issues like missing data, and variations in the case definition. This study was conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER statement, see Additional file 2) [17].\nAdditional demographic variables were collected from World Bank Databank (\nhttps://data.worldbank.org/\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/\n\nData variables\nPrevalence, incidence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with anxiety disorders were analyzed. DALY combines years lived with disability and the years of life lost due to premature death. Data for anxiety disorders were obtained using the GBD Results tool [20]. The GBD Compare tool was utilized for data visualization [21]. In GBD, anxiety disorders are coded as B.6.4 under the category of Mental Disorders.\nData analysis\nWe analyzed the data using GBD analytical tools, including visualization [22]. These tools helped to achieve the highest fidelity. Both raw and age-adjusted rates of anxiety disorder prevalence and incidence were analyzed. Age-standardized rates allow interpretations about intrinsic changes in anxiety disorder burden by removing the effect of population age over time and across regions and countries. Age-specific incidence rates were utilized to evaluate the age of onset of anxiety disorders. The authors aimed to evaluate whether the age of onset was decreasing over time by comparing figures over the last three decades.\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed for summary statistics, temporal trends, and bivariate correlations. Multivariate analysis was conducted using multiple linear regression. Variables were checked for normality and multicollinearity. Data analysis was carried out using Jamovi statistical software (version 1.8) [23]. Missing data were not imputed. An alpha level of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nAs with other mental disorders, data on the prevalence of anxiety disorders are numerous but often conflicting. Globally, the considerable variability in prevalence figures could represent a different distribution of risk factors for these disorders. Nevertheless, methodological and cultural factors as well as the evolution of diagnostic criteria over time probably play an important role. The reason that age-adjusted prevalence and incidence of anxiety disorders have been stable over the past three decades is not immediately apparent, but multiple factors are likely involved. This finding appears to conflict with the literature showing that common mental health issues are on the rise [12, 14, 24]. Much of the extant literature from the United States, Canada, and Western Europe has shown that common mental health issues like anxiety and depression are more prevalent now than in the past [24]. This discrepancy is potentially due to us reporting the global prevalence and incidence of anxiety disorders, combining the data from Western countries with those from other regions of the world where anxiety may not be increasing. This study showed that the total number of individuals affected rose by more than 50%. Thus, more individuals worldwide are developing anxiety disorders, but the age-adjusted prevalence rate has probably remained the same due to changes in underlying population structure.\nThe incidence pattern of anxiety disorders changes with age. Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders in young people, whereas the incidence of new cases of anxiety declines after the age of 65 [25, 26]. Thus, the overall population increase and an increasing proportion of the younger and older population in different countries may result in misleading prevalence and incidence measurements associated with anxiety disorders. The prevalence of anxiety disorders may appear to remain stable when it actually has increased for some age ranges.\nIn recent decades, there has been increased knowledge of the causes of anxiety disorders, enhanced preventive measures, and greater access to proactive mental health care services [9, 13, 24]. More service users are capitalizing on available mental health services now than in past generations, and there is a large body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy for reducing symptoms of anxiety disorders [9, 27, 28]. In many cases, these interventions can be delivered virtually, allowing for service provision to reach a global clientele and increasing access to affordable mental health care for a large proportion of the population than ever before [13].\nThis study also found that a significantly large burden of anxiety disorders, as measured by the total number of cases, was present in high-income, economically developed countries. This finding is consistent with previous research demonstrating a link between affluence and anxiety [29-31]. The reason that anxiety is more prevalent in higher-income countries could be due to a range of factors, like the typical lifestyle in affluent compared to developing countries [29, 30]. In more prosperous societies, jobs are typically more sedentary in nature. People obtain less physical activity; individuals are more likely to consume a diet heavy in processed foods, sodium, and sugar, which can catalyze psychophysiological reactions that impact mood and affect [14, 27, 29]. High sodium levels can result in elevated blood pressure, resulting in psychological symptoms like stress and anxiety [14, 29]. Simple sugars can cause sharp spikes in blood glucose levels, resulting in anxiety symptoms [27]. These factors can negatively impact mental health and increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder over time [27].\nDespite being economically affluent, mean happiness ratings in many wealthier countries are often lower than those of emerging countries, suggesting that income is not a buffer against mental health issues [30]. Individuals in wealthier nations may face more daily pressures to achieve and portray an image of wealth and beauty to others, which can adversely affect self-image and contribute to anxiety [11]. Evidence suggests a higher rate of mental health problems in individualistic societies compared to collectivistic settings and that culture may be a significant factor underpinning the relationship between mental health and wealth throughout the world. Those in individualistic cultures may perceive less available social support and instead feel either isolated from or competitive with fellow members of society [31, 32]. Furthermore, engagement with technology can be a risk factor for anxiety [4]. Individuals in prosperous countries have higher social media and technology use rates than developing countries [30]. An increasing body of evidence has shown that technology and engagement with social media are positively correlated with anxiety disorders in young people [28].\nThere is considerable variance in how different countries and cultures define mental health issues and mental illness [33]. How mental health issues like anxiety are defined can significantly impact epidemiological measurements and help-seeking behaviors on the part of the population and approaches to prevention and service provision on the part of healthcare providers and health and social care policymakers [33]. The relatively larger volume of research and evidence related to anxiety disorders emerging from more affluent countries may also indicate that the prevalence is higher in these countries, as more efforts are made to survey and monitor the population. In developing countries, there are relatively less consistent and standardized efforts to monitor anxiety levels, and population members are less likely to seek available help due to a lack of knowledge of anxiety, a lack of economic resources, or different cultural conceptions of appropriate ways in which to manage symptoms of anxiety [34]. These factors may contribute to the appearance that anxiety is more prevalent in affluent nations when this discrepancy may be more strongly related to differences in how anxiety is perceived, understood, and measured in affluent versus emerging nations.\nThe study revealed weak associations between anxiety disorders and alcohol consumption, urbanization, and the proportion of dependent older persons. This finding is compatible with the existing literature on the relationship between alcohol and mental health [32, 34]. Research has shown that common mental health issues tend to be more prevalent in individuals who consume higher amounts of alcohol [35, 36]. Alcohol is often used as a coping method for underlying mental health issues, and those with issues like depression and anxiety are much more likely to self-medicate via easily accessible substances like alcohol [35]. However, self-reported rates of anxiety in individuals who consume large amounts of alcohol may not accurately reflect the actual level of anxiety in this population subgroup because alcohol may partially or entirely alleviate their symptoms [34].\nThe finding associated with the relationship between anxiety and urbanization is consistent with recent research evidence [1, 37]. Our study has demonstrated that individuals living in high-income countries are more likely to report anxiety disorders. Urbanization is inextricably linked to socioeconomic development. Socioeconomic factors and the need for the workforce to be close to the work environment drive urbanization, resulting in large cities and built-up environments [35]. Previous research has suggested that urbanization is linked with mental health issues, such as depression and chronic stress [38]. Urbanization tends to increase population density, which can be detrimental to mental health by increasing noise, potentially reducing safety, and generally increasing sources of stress and anxiety [37]. The association between anxiety and urbanization may suggest that, like greater GDP per capita and access to electricity and clean water, urbanization is an important feature of socioeconomic development in relation to anxiety prevalence in society.\nThis study confirms the relationship between anxiety burden and a high proportion of dependent older persons in a society. The proportion of the older population is on the rise globally, with the proportion of the global population over 60 years projected to reach 22% in the next three decades [39]. In 2017, the World Health Organization estimated that 4% of the older population worldwide suffered from anxiety disorders [39]. Providing mental healthcare to older persons is a significant challenge for nations worldwide. The prevalence of mental disorders in the older segment of the population puts stress on an individual's well-being and jeopardizes society's health and socioeconomic security on the whole [39-41]. The relationship between the anxiety burden and the proportion of dependent older persons in the wider society can be explained by societal attitudes informing the relationship between an individual and the older, frail members of society. In individualistic cultures, caring for an older person can become a source of stress, financially and emotionally. This results in many older persons being looked after in formal care settings [42]. In these societies, a high percentage of dependent older persons may negatively impact stress levels for their families and carers and represent a source of anxiety for a wider section of the population. A higher percentage of dependent elderly persons may also impact how healthcare funds are allocated and which types of health issues are prioritized. In a country with a high percentage of dependent older persons, there is a strong likelihood that chronic and long-term physical conditions will represent the most significant portion of healthcare spending, and issues like mental health will be less strongly emphasized [43, 44]. This will potentially result in unmet mental health needs of the older population with increasing rates of anxiety in nations with more dependent elderly persons.\nLimitations\nWhile this study makes an important contribution to the literature associated with the global burden of anxiety disorders and its regional distribution, some limitations were present that warrant consideration. In general, comorbidity with at least one other psychiatric disorder is the rule rather than the exception in the case of anxiety disorders. The most common comorbid disorders are other anxiety and mood disorders, especially depression [45, 46]. First, the country-level comparisons made in this study are generalizations that are potentially susceptible to ecological bias. Thus, the findings from this study may reveal more about ecological factors than individual susceptibility to anxiety. Additionally, the GBD dataset relies on multiple sources that adopt heterogeneous methodologies and varying case definitions. This reliance can make the comparisons less robust. However, the statistical modeling techniques employed by GBD allowed for adjustments to be made for these potential sources of error. Currently, GBD provides the most comprehensive and current data on the burden of anxiety disorders, and its associated limitations were considered acceptable in this study and mildly influential on study outcomes. Each of these limitations elicits the need for caution when interpreting the results of this study.\nSFJ contributed in study conceptualization and supervision, data curation and original manuscript preparation and editing.

        "results": "Results\nAn estimated 4.05% of the global population has an anxiety disorder, translating to 301 million people. The number of persons affected has increased by more than 55% from 1990 to 2019. Anxiety disorder metrics show a continuous increase in prevalence, incidence, and DALY rates. Portugal has the highest prevalence (8,671 cases per 100,000), followed by Brazil, Iran, and New Zealand. The prevalence is higher in high-income regions. Women are 1.66 times more likely to be affected by anxiety disorders than men. Age-standardized rates have remained stable, indicating the possible stability of risk factors.\nResults\nPrevalence\nThe global prevalence of anxiety disorders in 2019 was 4.05% [uncertainty interval (UI); 3.39, 4.78]. Table 1 outlines the burden of anxiety disorders in selected countries and regions. The total number of individuals affected increased substantially between 1990 and 2019: increasing from 194.9 million to 301.4 million [UI; 252, 356 million] globally. The worldwide prevalence rate for all forms of mental health disorders was 12,537 cases per 100,000 persons [UI; 11,643, 13,497]. The prevalence rate of anxiety disorders was 3,895 per 100,000 population [UI; 3,264, 4,601]. Compared to other major mental health disorders, the prevalence of anxiety disorders was substantially higher. For instance, the prevalence of bipolar disorder was 511 cases, and schizophrenia was 304 cases per 100,000 persons.

Data from Global Burden of Disease, 2019. DALY = disability-adjusted life years\nWomen were more likely to be affected by anxiety disorders than men. Among all ages, the prevalence rate among women was 4,862 per 100,000 [UI; 4,089, 5,746] compared to 2,933 per 100,000 [UI; 2,458, 3,482] in men.\nGlobally, certain regions had a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders. Latin America and Caribbean regions, as well as high-income regions of North America and Western Europe, had the highest rates (Fig. 1). South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa ranked the lowest in terms of the prevalence of anxiety disorders. The highest prevalence rates in descending order were: Portugal (8,671 cases per 100,000 population), Brazil (7,993 cases per 100,000), Iran (7,537 cases), New Zealand (7,375 cases), Netherlands (7,205 cases), and Switzerland (7,144 cases per 100,000). In terms of the total number of individuals living with anxiety disorders, China (47.8 million cases), India (41.8 million), the United States (20.2 million), Brazil (17.3 million), and Indonesia (9.5 million) have the highest burden in the world.Fig. 1\nGlobal distribution of anxiety disorders. Legend: Colors indicate prevalence rates per 100,000 population (all ages) in 2019. Color shades represent the range of prevalence rates of anxiety disorders, in decreasing order, from dark red (8,600 cases per 100,000), orange, yellow, light blue, and dark blue hues (2,000 cases per 100,000)\nTrends\nAnxiety disorder metrics presented a stable pattern, with mild fluctuations in prevalence, incidence, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) rates worldwide between 1990 and 2019 Age-standardized rates were used to adjust for changes in the underlying population age structure. Western European countries showed a faster rate of rise than the global average. Brazil, in particular, experienced a marked increase in prevalence rates, from 5,894 cases per 100,000 population in 1990 to 7,410 per 100,000 in 2019. The total number of cases continued to rise with population growth and aging in all world regions except Europe. After age standardization (to control for population aging), incidence and prevalence rates appeared to remain stable during the same period (Fig. 2). Hence, there appeared to be no intrinsic increase in the rates of anxiety disorders after controlling for population aging.Fig. 2\nTrends in the burden of anxiety disorders (1990-2019). Legend. The rates are age-adjusted. Age-standardization removes the effect of changes in population age distribution over time and across regions. Prevalence = cases per 100,000 population; DALY = disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 population\nAge of onset\nRemarkably, the age distribution of new cases showed an incidence starting as early as ten years of age onwards (Fig. 3A). There were two modal peaks at 10-to-14 and 35-to-39 years of age. The incidence of new cases declines after 65 years of age. However, the prevalence remains high in the elderly (Fig. 3B). The age distribution of new cases and the prevalence of anxiety disorders has not changed over the last three decades (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3\nAge distribution of anxiety disorders\nBivariate correlations\nAnxiety prevalence was strongly correlated with measures of economic development (Fig. 4A). Higher prevalence of anxiety disorders was associated with greater GDP per capita (r = 0.47; p < 0.001). Similarly, other indicators of economic prosperity such as SDI (r = 0.53; p < 0.001), access to electricity (r = 0.42; p < 0.001), clean drinking water (r = 0.44; p < 0.001) and literacy rate (r = 0.31; p = 0.007). However, anxiety disorders did not correlate with unemployment rates (r = -0.03; p = 0.8) or economic inequality (Gini index; r = -0.11; p = 0.15).Fig. 4\nAssociation between anxiety disorder prevalence, Social Development Index, and Urbanization (n = 204 countries). Legend. Prevalence = cases per 100,000 population; SDI = Social Development Index; Urbanization = proportion of population in Urban areas\nUrbanization was associated with higher anxiety rates (r = 0.46; p < 0.001; Fig. 4B). The social burden of the dependent elderly was also associated with increased anxiety disorders (r = 0.42; p < 0.001). There was a weak but statistically significant association with alcohol consumption per capita (r = 0.26; p < 0.001).\nMultivariate analysis\nOn multiple linear regression, economic development factors (SDI and GDP per capita) and urbanization were predictors of anxiety disorders, while literacy rate and dependency were not statistically significant (adjusted R2 = 0.32). The standardized regression coefficients, which can be compared to indicate relative importance, were SDI (0.32), GDP per capita (0.18), and urbanization (0.16).",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThree key findings were identified based on a sample of the latest data from GBD. Age-adjusted prevalence and incidence of anxiety disorders have been stable over the past three decades. Furthermore, it was determined that anxiety disorders (as measured by the total number of cases) were higher in high-income, economically developed countries. Finally, we found weak associations between anxiety disorder prevalence and alcohol consumption, urbanization, and the proportion of dependent older persons in the population.",

        "introduction": "Background\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications have been associated with mental health services utilization and medication consumption, there is no longitudinal study on the long-term impact on ADHD medication use trends.\nBackground\nA steady growth in the use of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications has been reported for the decades prior to the COVID-19 pandemic [5, 16, 23]. This was associated with an increase in the general awareness of ADHD among the public, practitioners, and psychotherapists alike. An important contributing factor was the broadening of the diagnostic criteria, e.g., the elimination of exclusion criteria such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the DSM-5 released in 2013 [1]. Also, DSM-5 reduced the symptoms threshold for adults and the necessity of a childhood onset for an adult-ADHD diagnosis has become a matter of debate [4, 18]. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a break in this steady growth: We showed in a previous study that, globally, ADHD medicine consumption in 2020 was on average per country 6% lower than predicted based on pre-pandemic data [12]. However, several studies reported adverse effects of the pandemic on patients with ADHD in form of increased ADHD symptoms [6, 24, 25]. In fact, towards the end of 2021, the actual consumption slightly exceeded the predicted consumption without the occurrence of the pandemic [12]. Recent studies reported that the pandemic led to greater stress in children with ADHD in general [11], as well as medium-term impacts on children with ADHD of pandemic-related stress specifically [26]. Pre-pandemic studies found prolonged effects of stress exposure in form of worsened and persistent ADHD symptoms from childhood into young adulthood [14, 15]. Because no studies to date have investigated ADHD medication consumption in Europe after COVID-19, this study aimed to assess the long-term impact of the pandemic in the European ADHD medication market, particulary answering the question if the post-pandemic surge is only a catch-up effect or if the pandemic has indeed accelerated consumption growth in the long run. We examined changes in ADHD medicine consumption trends from pre-pandemic (2014 to 2019) to post-pandemic (2021 to 2022) in 28 European countries. We also measured the deviation of the actual consumption in 2022 from the prediction under non-pandemic conditions.",
        "methodology": "Methods\nThis study examines the European ADHD medication consumption in 2020 to 2022 compared to the predicted consumption assuming the persistence of pre-pandemic trends. Predictions are calculated using Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models.\nMethods\nData sources\nWe used quarterly data obtained from IQVIA Multinational Integrated Data Analysis System (IQVIA MIDAS[R]). IQVIA MIDAS data combine country-level data, healthcare expertise and therapeutic knowledge in 90 + countries to deliver data in globally standardized forms to facilitate multi-country analyses.\nThe database includes the sales of generic and brand products and does not contain individual-level data. Thus, institutional review board approval was not required. This study is based on sales volume data of ADHD medications from Quarter 1, 2014 to Quarter 4, 2022 of 28 European countries including information about the number of sold standard units, the strength, the active substances, and the sales value of each drug. Some of the substances included in the data set are also approved for other indications than ADHD treatment. However, in this study only sales data of medications specifically indicated for the treatment of ADHD (ATC class N06B) were evaluated.\nPopulation estimates of each country were obtained from the UN World Population Prospects 2022 report [28]. Definitions of the defined daily dose (DDD), which is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults [29] were obtained by the World Health Organization (WHO) for each substance.\nData analysis\nAs we do not observe the quantity of interest, consumption, directly, we use the sales data as proxy. It is plausible to assume that the error margin of medicine that is sold, but not consumed, remains fairly stable across regions and time, and does not distort the spatial and temporal analysis. We chose DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day as the main quantity of interest. Although individual doses vary, this number strongly correlates with the prevalence of diagnosed patients. Using the country-level sales volume data, the measure 'DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day' was calculated as following: [formula omitted]where standard.units are the number of sold standard units of each medication, strength is the dose of its active substance, DDD is the defined daily dose depending on the substance, population is the population estimate of the country at the time of sales and #days is the number of days in the time period. This measure is useful for comparison as it is standardized not only by time but also by population size.\nWe analyzed the European ADHD medicine consumption usage before and after the pandemic (2014 to 2022), per country and in total. Pre- and post-pandemic time trend coefficients were estimated by linear regression models using consumption data in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day from 2014 to 2019 (pre-pandemic) and from 2021 to 2022 (post-pandemic) including an intercept, time of sales (linear trend) and quarters as regressors. The year 2020 was left out in the regression analyses to avoid distortions. We tested, for Europe in total and for each country, the one-sided hypothesis that the post-pandemic trend coefficient is not larger than the pre-pandemic trend coefficient. Rejection of this one-sided hypothesis provides evidence for a post-pandemic increase of the trend. Details on the test are given in the Supplement.\nAdditionally, we analyzed the differences in active substances of ADHD medication. They can be divided into stimulants (amfetamine, dexmethylphenidate, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate), which are recommended as first-line pharmacological treatment, and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and guanfacine), which are recommended for patients who cannot tolerate stimulants, do not benefit from them or who suffer from substance use disorders [9, 19]. The effects can last 3-5 h (short-acting) or 8-12 h (long-acting).\nTo further quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ADHD medicine consumption, we forecasted the sales volume of the years 2020 to 2022 based on the national consumption trends until 2019. The impact was assessed by fitting a SARIMA model [10] and comparing its predictions to the actual sales volume. We used R [22], version 4.1.3, for data analysis.\nFor each country and for Europe in total, we calculated the difference between the actual ADHD medication consumption for the period from 2020 to 2022 and the predicted consumption under non-pandemic conditions. Towards this end, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models of order [1])x [1])4 were fitted using the maximum-likelihood method to the quarterly consumption during 2014 Q1 to 2019 Q4. Based on the thus fitted models, quarterly forecasts for the consumption levels in 2020, 2021, and 2022 were obtained. Hence, the pre-pandemic trends in national ADHD medicine consumption were extrapolated under the assumption of unchanged conditions, i.e., without the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, see Fig. 3.\nFig. 3:\nPredicted and actual global quarterly consumption of ADHD medication. DDD = defined daily dose\nIn the first year of the pandemic, we found lower consumption than predicted in most of the European countries. Twenty of the 28 European countries recorded a drop of ADHD medication consumption in 2020 (Table 5; Fig. 4). The highest losses were in Romania, Portugal, and Italy. Only in three countries (Latvia, Greece, and the Netherlands) did consumption substantially exceed the predictions. In Europe, ADHD medicine consumption amounted to 2.64 instead of the predicted 2.71 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, which corresponds to a relative loss of 2.34%. On country average, the national ADHD consumption in 2020 was 4.8% lower than predicted.\nTable 5:\nActual and predicted annual ADHD medicine consumption and relative difference per country in Europe\nFig. 4:\nPercentage difference of actual and predicted ADHD medication consumption in 28 European countries in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in 2020, 2021 and 2022. DDD = defined daily dose\nIn 2021, ADHD medication consumption in European countries on average returned back to the predicted level (Table 5; Fig. 4). While ten countries still recorded lower actual sales than forecasted, the remaining 18 countries met or even exceeded predictions. On average, the actual national ADHD medicine sales in 2021 were 0.98% above their predictions. Highest losses were recorded in Romania, Slovakia, and Italy, whereas Latvia, Greece, and the Netherlands again surpassed predictions the most. Throughout Europe, the actual consumption in 2021 (2.98 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day) was 2.65% higher than predicted (2.90 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day).\nIn 2022 however, medication usage levels were not only close to pre-pandemic predictions, but clearly exceeded them (Table 5; Fig. 4). In 23 of the 28 countries, the actual ADHD medication consumption was higher than predicted; in ten countries consumption surpassed predictions by more than 20%. The average relative deviation revealed a mean exceedance of national consumption forecasts by 16.4% in 2022. Only in five countries ADHD medicine sales were below the predictions. Belgium (-9%), Slovakia (-6%), the Czech Republic (-4%), Romania (-16%), and Italy (-6%). These countries were also among those most negatively impacted in 2020 and 2021.\nThroughout Europe, the consumption in 2022 was predicted as 3.08 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day without the emergence of COVID-19, whereas the actual consumption amounted to 3.43 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, which corresponds to an increase of 11.5%.\nComparing the mean national (unweighted averages) relative differences per quarter (Fig. 5), we found remarkably high exceedances of the predictions in the last three quarters of 2022. While in the first quarter of 2022, the actual consumption levels were on average 7% above forecast, which is about the same extent as the last quarter in 2021, consumption in the second and the third quarters surpasses the pre-pandemic trends by 18.7% and 17.3%, respectively. In Quarter 4 of 2022, the actual consumptions were on average even 23.3% higher than predicted, which contradicts the assumption of the increased ADHD medication use being only a catch-up effect of 2020.\nFig. 5:\nMean relative difference between actual and predicted ADHD medicine consumption (in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day) per quarter, 2020-2022.

        "results": "Results\nWhile European ADHD medication sales recorded a drop in 2020, they returned to the predicted level in 2021, even slightly exceeding it. In 2022, we found a clear exceedance of the predicted level by 16.4% on average at country level. Furthermore, the increase in consumption growth in the post-pandemic period (2021-2022) compared to the pre-pandemic period (2014-2019) was significant in 26 of the 28 European countries under consideration.\nResults\nIncreased growth of European ADHD medicine consumption after the pandemic\nBefore the pandemic, the annual ADHD medicine consumption growth in Europe was consistently around 5 to 6% (Table 1). However, from 2018 to 2019, we observed a higher increase of 9.7%, which decreased from 2019 to the pandemic affected year 2020 to 4.7%. In the following years, we observed remarkably higher growth rates of 12.7% in 2021 and 15.2% in 2022.\nTable 1:\nAnnual ADHD medicine consumption and percentage change in Europe, 2014-22. DDD = defined daily dose\nComparing ADHD medication consumption by active substances (Table 2), we found increasing trends in all substances. Stimulants (methylphenidate, amfetamine, lisdexamfetamine or dexamfetamine) are by far the most frequently prescribed medications, followed by non-stimulants (atomoxetine or guanfacine). Methylphenidate has the highest share of the European consumption, however, due to rapid growth of lisdexamfetamine medications, its share decreases steadily (Fig. 1). We also found that consumption of long-acting medications increased stronger than prescriptions of short-acting medications, which accounted for 21% of total European consumption in 2014, but for only 15% in 2022 (Table 3).\nTable 2:\nAnnual ADHD medicine consumption by substance in Europe, in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day. DDD = defined daily dose\nFig. 1:\nShare of substances on European ADHD medication consumption. DDD = defined daily dose\nTable 3:\nAnnual ADHD medicine consumption by duration of action in Europe, in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day. DDD = defined daily dose\nIn line with previous studies, we found substantial differences in national ADHD medication use levels in 2019, ranging from 0.009 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in Bulgaria to 16.49 in Sweden. In general, the highest levels of medicine consumption were recorded in Scandinavian countries (Sweden, Norway, and Denmark), followed by the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Finland (Figure S2 in the Supplement). Eastern European countries generally showed the lowest consumption levels. However, time trends were comparable across most European countries. In the pre-pandemic years up to 2019, time trend estimates were significant at the 5% level in all countries except Romania and Luxembourg. In the post-pandemic period (2021 to 2022), regression slope estimates were significantly positive in all 28 countries. Moreover, post-pandemic time trend estimates were larger than pre-pandemic in all countries (Table 4; see also Figure S3 in the Supplement). In Luxembourg, and Romania, the consumption trend even switched from declining into increasing during the pandemic. In 26 of the 28 countries, the regression slopes after the pandemic (2021 to 2022) were significantly larger than before the pandemic (2014 to 2019). Non-significant increases were observed in Belgium and Croatia (Table 4). Throughout Europe (Fig. 2), the pre-pandemic regression slope was estimated as 0.03 (p < 0.001), increasing to 0.11 (p < 0.001) in the post-pandemic period. The latter is significantly larger than the former (p < 0.001).

        "discussion": "Discussion\nIn this study, we found an increased consumption growth of ADHD medications in Europe after the pandemic. A possible cause is the general increase of mental health issues caused by anti-pandemic mitigation measures, including the worsening of ADHD symptoms [6, 21]. Recent research showed a medium-term impact of pandemic-related stress on children with ADHD [26]. Social withdrawal is also associated with a decreased likelihood of symptom remission in patients with major psychiatric disorders [20], which potentially led to greater ADHD medication demand in the long run. However, other factors unrelated to the pandemic might have also been contributing to the rise in ADHD medication sales. Changing diagnosis criteria as well as increasing awareness of ADHD in media and social media, indicated, e.g., by a steadily increasing popularity of the Google search term \"ADHD\" [13], led to a significantly increased prevalence in recent years, especially in individuals of colour and females [1]. Although the role of social media and \"ADHD influencer\" are a relatively new phenomenon, the number of views on TikTok of the hashtag #ADHD was frequently reported as 11 billion as of May 2022 [17] and has reached 33 billion now [27]. Also, access to an ADHD diagnosis has become easier. In several countries, the initial referral to a diagnosis can now be carried out be a GP rather than a psychotherapist [2, 3]. This is a response to the high demand of psychiatric support in comparison to the limited resource, resulting in long waiting times to diagnoses and therapies. Both of these effects, social media and easier access, potentially have been amplified by the pandemic, where access to healthcare resources was limited, but the psychological burden of social isolation and the time spent on social media largely increased.\nIn line with our results, other studies analyzing the impact of the pandemic on medication use found a significant increase in the consumption of psychotropic drugs in the French population after March 2020 [7] and an increase in rates of psychotropic medication use and psychiatric disorder diagnoses for Danish youths from March 2020 to June 22 [8]. We have also carried out analogous analysis for 17 other countries in different regions of the world. With four notable exceptions (e.g. China, Indonesia), a very similar picture emerges throughout the world. However, as we do not have complete data coverage of the world, most notably, not of North America, which is by far the biggest market of ADHD medicine, this study focused on Europe. Although Europe comprises different cultural areas with quite diverse histories and perceptions of ADHD and strong differences in the diagnosis prevalence, the increase in the consumption trend was observed throughout all considered European countries. This provides evidence that this is not a localized effect that can be attributed to cultural or healthcare-system-specific reasons.\nIn this study, the use of international pharmaceutical sales data enabled an analysis and quantification of the medium- and long-term effect of the COVID-19 pandemic response measures on ADHD medication consumption in Europe. However, the prevalence of ADHD was not examined as this study only evaluates sales data of ADHD medications. Furthermore, the data do not contain individual-level treatment data necessary to measure trends by age, gender, or appropriateness of prescribing. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions regarding overuse, underuse, or misuse.",

Consistent with previous research [5, 23], we observed a wide variation in ADHD medication use, with the highest usage levels in Northern countries and lower levels in Eastern Europe. However, all countries except Luxembourg and Romania recorded an increasing trend in linear regression models significant at the 5% level in the pre-pandemic period from 2014 to 2019. After a drop in 2020, especially in the second quarter, when social mitigation measures were taken to prevent the spread of the at the time novel Coronavirus, medication consumption returned to the predicted level by 2021 in most countries. Towards the end of 2021, usage levels even tended to exceed predictions. Throughout Europe, the actual consumption was 2.3% below predictions in 2020. In contrast, in 2021, consumption surpassed pre-pandemic predictions by 2.6%. While these exceedances in 2021 might be a catch-up effect due to reduced consumption in previous quarters, the noticeably increased growth observed in all four quarters of 2022 argues in favour of the pandemic having a catalyzing effect on ADHD medication consumption growth in the long run. Throughout Europe, the annual ADHD medicine consumption, predicted as 3.08 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, achieved an actual value of 3.43 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, corresponding to a relative rise of 11.5%. At country-level, 23 of the 28 European countries recorded higher ADHD medication sales volumes than predicted, ten of them even surpassed expectations by more than 20%. On average, national annual consumption was 16.4% higher than predicted. Quarterly comparisons of predictions and actual values revealed relatively small deviations in Quarter 1 of 2022 but increasing positive deviations in the following quarters with Quarter 4 showing the highest mean national exceedance of forecasts by more than 23%.\nIn all European countries examined, the estimated regression time trend parameter in the post-pandemic period (2021 to 2022) was higher than in the pre-pandemic period (2014 to 2019). Decreasing trends in Romania and Luxembourg were reversed after the pandemic. In 26 of the 28 countries, the post-pandemic time trend was significantly larger than before the pandemic. In the European total, the slope estimator rose significantly (p < 0.001) from 0.03 in the pre-pandemic period to 0.11 in the post-pandemic period.\nFurther research is needed to investigate the long-term impact of the pandemic on ADHD prevalence and prescribing patterns as well as medication trends beyond the study period. Moreover, analyses of this study should also be carried out for countries in other continents, to examine if this is a European trend only or if similar effects can be observed globally. Health care systems should build strategies that can prevent population at risk from long term effects caused by socially disruptive events like the pandemic effectively.\nAbbreviations: ADHD: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; DDD: Defined Daily Dose; SARIMA: Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average; WHO: World Health Organization\nAcknowledgements: We thank MEDICE Arzneimittel P\u00fctter GmbH & Co.

        "introduction": "Introduction",
        "methodology": "Background: Interhemispheric cooperation is one of the most prominent functional architectures of the human brain. In patients with schizophrenia, interhemispheric cooperation deficits have been reported using increasingly powerful neurobehavioural and neuroimaging measures. However, these methods rely in part on the assumption of anatomic symmetry between hemispheres. In the present study, we explored interhemispheric cooperation deficits in schizophrenia using a newly developed index, connectivity between functionally homotopic voxels (CFH), which is unbiased by hemispheric asymmetry. Methods: Patients with schizophrenia and age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent multimodal MRI, and whole-brain CFH maps were constructed for comparison between groups. We examined the correlations of differing CFH values between the schizophrenia and control groups using various neurotransmitter receptor and transporter densities. Results: We included 86 patients with schizophrenia and 86 matched controls in our analysis. Patients with schizophrenia showed significantly lower CFH values in the frontal lobes, left postcentral gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus, and significantly greater CFH values in the right caudate nucleus than healthy controls. Moreover, the differing CFH values in patients with schizophrenia were significantly correlated with positive symptom score and illness duration. Functional connectivity within frontal lobes was significantly reduced at the voxel cluster level compared with healthy controls. Finally, the abnormal CFH map of patients with schizophrenia was spatially associated with the densities of the dopamine [D.sub.1] and [D.sub.2] receptors, fluorodopa, dopamine transporter, serotonin transporter and acetylcholine transporter. Conclusion: Regional abnormalities in interhemispheric cooperation may contribute to the clinical symptoms of schizophrenia. These CFH abnormalities may be associated with dysfunction in neurotransmitter systems strongly implicated in schizophrenia.\nInterhemispheric cooperation allows for more efficient information processing during complex cognitive tasks. (1-4) Schizophrenia is considered a disconnectivity syndrome characterized by disrupted functional connectivity between brain areas, including areas in opposite hemispheres. (5) These abnormalities in interhemispheric connectivity have been confirmed at the behavioural level and by brain activity measures using various neuroimaging methods. (6-9)\nBehavioural studies have reported that healthy individuals show an advantage in processing information presented bilaterally compared with the same information presented initially to a single hemisphere. (10) However, this bilateral advantage is generally absent in patients with schizophrenia, suggesting a deficit in interhemispheric cooperation. (11-13) Accumulating evidence from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) also supports the hypothesis of regional interhemispheric cooperation abnormalities in both early-onset and adult schizophrenia, regardless of medication use. (9,14-16) Moreover, these interhemispheric cooperation impairments have been strongly correlated with symptom severity and, along with clinical symptoms, have been shown to improve with drug therapy. (17,18) In addition, it has been reported that interhemispheric cooperation increased significantly in specific brain regions compared with healthy controls. (19) Therefore, interhemispheric cooperation abnormalities appear throughout the course of schizophrenia and contribute to pathogenesis.\nIn previous fMRI studies, interhemispheric cooperation was typically quantified by the correlation between a given voxel in 1 hemisphere and its mirrored voxel in the opposite hemisphere. (20) However, the bilateral hemispheres are not anatomically symmetric. (21) Regardless, investigators have normalized individual brain connectivity maps using a standard symmetric template, which may produce unexpected biases. The advantages of using functional rather than anatomic correspondence have also been clearly shown by the construction of precise cross-hemispheric cortical maps. (22) Thus, a better option would be to define homotopic regions based on function rather than structural features.\nIn the present study, we examined changes in interhemispheric cooperation among patients with schizophrenia relative to matched healthy controls using a newly developed index, connectivity between functionally homotopic voxels (CFH), in which the functional homotopic region of a given voxel is defined as the point with the largest functional connectivity (FC) value in the contralateral hemisphere. Thus, regions with higher CFH values communicate more extensively across hemispheres. Recently, CFH was used to measure the interhemispheric cooperation in patients with Parkinson disease. (23) To facilitate the development of future treatments, we also examined whether the CFH differences were associated with neurotransmitter receptor and transporter densities.\nMethods\nParticipants\nWe recruited right-handed patients with schizophrenia aged 17-53 years from the Anhui Mental Health Center, Hefei, China. Schizophrenia was diagnosed by 2 psychiatrists using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (SCID-IV). All patients were assessed for symptom severity using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). We excluded patients with a history of significant head trauma or neurologic disorders, history of addiction (including alcohol or drugs), focal brain lesions on [T.sub.1]- or [T.sub.2]-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery images and any contraindications to MRI. Age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited from the local community. The healthy controls had no history of psychiatric or neurologic disorders and met the safety criteria for MRI.\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Anhui Medical University. All participants provided written informed consent before examination.\nMRI data acquisition\nFunctional and structural MRI data were acquired at the University of Science and Technology of China (Hefei, Anhui Province) using a 3.0 T scanner (Discovery 750, GE Healthcare) with the same parameters as in our previous studies. (24) Briefly, functional images (217 volumes) were acquired using a single-shot gradient-recalled echo planar imaging sequence (repetition time [TR] 2400 ms, echo time [TE] 30 ms, flip angle 90[degrees]). Images of 46 transverse sections (field of view [FOV] 192 * 192 [mm.sup.2], 64 * 64 in-plane matrix, section thickness 3 mm without intersection gap) were acquired parallel to the anteroposterior commissure line. High spatial resolution [T.sub.1]-weighted anatomic images were then acquired in the sagittal orientation using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradientecho sequence (TR 8.16 ms, TE 3.18 ms, flip angle 12[degrees], FOV 256 * 256 [mm.sup.2], 256 * 256 matrix, section thickness 1 mm without intersection gap, voxel size 1 * 1 * 1 [mm.sup.3], 188 sections). Foam fillers and earplugs were used to minimize head motion and attenuate scanner noise during image acquisition. All participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed and rest without falling asleep during scanning.\nResting state-MRI data preprocessing\nAll fMRI data preprocessing steps were performed using the WhiteMatter toolkit (https://github.com/jigongjun/ Neuroimaging-and-Neuromodulation), which includes selected functions of AFNI, (25) SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl. ac.uk/spm/software/spm12) and FSL (http://fsl.fmrib.ox. ac.uk/fsl). Briefly, preprocessing consisted of the following steps: deletion of the first 5 functional volumes; despiking; slice timing correction and realignment; coregistering individual functional data to structural images and segmenting structural images into grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); regressing out 27 nuisance signals (average white matter, CSF and whole-brain signals as well as 24 head motion parameters, including the 6 head motion parameters, 6 head motion parameters 1 time point before and 12 corresponding squared items (26)); smoothing of functional images using a 4-mm isotropic Gaussian kernel; temporal band-pass filtering (0.01-0.1 Hz); and spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the matrix produced by structural image segmentation and the DARTEL algorithm of SPM12. Whole scan images were discarded if head motion exceeded 3 mm of translation or 3[degrees] of rotation during scanning.\nCFH calculation\nWe developed a new index to measure interhemispheric cooperation, CFH. The method for calculating CFH was described in detail in our previous study. (23) Briefly, each voxel was used as a seed to calculate whole-brain FC maps, which were then averaged across all participants. The voxel with the maximal resting-state FC value in the contralateral hemisphere was defined as the homotopic voxel for the seed voxel. Pearson correlations between seed and homotopic voxels were then Z-score transformed to improve the normality. The resulting values were defined as the CFH value used to quantify the interhemispheric cooperation and were used for subsequent group-level analyses. A higher CFH value is considered indicative of stronger communication with the opposite hemisphere.\nThe homotopic regions of a given voxel were defined as its mirrored voxel in the opposite hemisphere in most previous fMRI studies. However, we define homotopic regions based on function rather than structural features in our study. Here, we calculate the distances between the anatomically homotopic voxels and functionally homotopic voxels (Appendix 1, available at https://www.jpn.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/ jpn.230037/tab-related-content).\nSpatial correlation with receptor and transporter density\nWe also examined whether CFH abnormalities were associated with specific transmitter systems implicated in schizophrenia by comparing the pattern of group differences in CFH values to the densities of various neurotransmitter receptors, transporters and synaptic markers from density atlases. These atlases were obtained from previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies of healthy individuals. Density maps of the following molecules were selected based on known or hypothesized associations with schizophrenia pathology: dopamine receptors ([D.sub.1R], (27) [D.sub.2R] (28)), serotonin receptors ([5-HT.sub.1AR], (29) [5-HT.sub.1BR], (30) [5-HT2.sub.AR], (30) [5-HT.sub.4R] (30)), dopamine transporter (DAT), (31) serotonin transporter ([5-HT.sub.T]), (30) fluorodopa (F-DOPA; a reflection of presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity), (32) [gamma]-aminobutyric acid type A receptor ([GABA.sub.AR]), (31) norepinephrine transporter ([NA.sub.T]), (33) vesicular acetylcholine transporter ([VACh.sub.T]) (28) and metabotropic glutamate receptor ([mGlu.sub.R]). (28) Subsequently, density values were extracted from each PET atlas, and averaged within 360 regions based on the the HCP-MMP 1.0 atlas (https://cjneu rolab.org/). (34) We calculated the t values for CFH differences between the schizophrenia and control groups (independent sample t tests) and then extracted the t values and averaged them within 360 regions based on the HCP-MMP atlas. Finally, we used Spearman correlation analysis to investigate the associations between CFH differences (t values) and neurotransmitter receptor and transporter density values. The significance threshold was set at 0.05 (2-tailed) with false discovery rate (FDR) correction.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables were compared between the schizophrenia and control groups with the Mann-Whitney U test, and categorical variables were compared with the Fisher exact test. Group differences in CFH values at a given location were compared using permutation testing with age and sex as covariates. This comparison test was performed within a grey matter mask using the Statistic nonParametric Mapping (SnPM13) toolbox of SPM12. (35) To control for family-wise error in multiple comparisons, we first set a cluster-defined threshold of t = 3.14 (corresponding to p = 0.001 at the voxel level). Only clusters surviving the cluster-level correction at [p.sub.corr] < 0.01 are reported. Pearson correlation analysis was then used to test the association between imaging data and clinical symptoms in schizophrenia. The significant threshold of correlation analysis was set at 0.05 (2-tailed), uncorrected. For visualization of MRI results we used Surf Ice (https://www. nitrc.org/projects/surfice/), MRIcroGL (https://www.mtrc. org/projects/mricrogl/) and BrainNet software (http:// www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/). (36)",
        "results": "Results\nParticipants\nWe included 86 patients with schizophrenia and 86 healthy controls in the final analysis. There was no significant difference in age or gender ratio between groups. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the schizophrenia and healthy control groups are summarized in Table 1.\nGroup differences in the CFH\nThe CFH maps of the schizophrenia and healthy control groups exhibited similar patterns (Figure 1 A and B). However, patients with schizophrenia showed significantly lower CFH values in the left middle orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left postcentral gyrus, right superior OFC, right medial OFC and right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG; Figure 1C). Patients with schizophrenia also showed significantly greater CFH values in the right caudate nucleus (Figure 1C). The details of the 6 clusters with significantly altered CFH values in patients with schizophrenia are summarized in Table 2.\nTo exclude the effect of head motion, we reanalyzed the group differences by adding mean frame displacement (FD) as a covariate. The results were very similar to our original findings. The peak MNI coordinates of the 6 clusters with significantly altered CFH values were the same. Only the number of voxels and the peak t value of the clusters changed slightly (Appendix 1, Table S1).\nCorrelations with clinical characteristics\nThe PANSS positive score was negatively correlated with CFH values of the left middle OFC (r = -0.23, p = 0.03; Figure 2A), while illness duration was positively correlated with CFH values in the right superior OFC (r = 0.28, p = 0.01; Figure 2B) and negatively correlated with CFH values in the right ITG (r = -0.27, p = 0.01; Figure 2C). No significant correlations were found between other CFH values with significant group differences and PANSS total, positive, negative and general scores or illness duration (Appendix 1, Table S2).\nCorrelations with receptor and transporter densities\nThe group difference in CFH (Figure 3A) was positively correlated with the densities of [5-HT1.sub.AR] (r = 0.35, p < 0.0001), [5-HT.sub.2AR] (r = 0.16, p = 0.006), [5-HT.sub.4R] (r = 0.18, p = 0.002), [5-HT.sub.T] (r = 0.19, p = 0.002), [D.sub.1R] (r = 0.24, p < 0.0001), [D.sub.2R] (r = 0.23, p < 0.0001), F-DOPA (r = 0.15, p = 0.011), [DA.sub.T] (r = 0.17, p = 0.005), [GABA.sub.AR] (r = 0.16, p = 0.006) and [VACh.sub.T] (r = 0.12, p = 0.04) (Figure 3B), but not with densities of the other receptors and transporters examined (Appendix 1, Table S3).",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nInterhemispheric cooperation was significantly altered in patients with schizophrenia compared with matched controls, and these abnormalities were correlated with clinical variables and with the densities of multiple neurotransmitter signalling proteins implicated in schizophrenia pathogenesis. Moreover, we found substantially reduced FC within the frontal lobes of patients with schizophrenia. These findings suggest that suboptimal interhemispheric cooperation, especially in the bilateral OFC, contributes to the cognitive and behavioural deficits in schizophrenia. Further, these interhemispheric cooperation deficits may involve dysfunction of dopamine, serotonin and cholinergic transmitter systems.\nAbnormal interhemispheric cooperation in schizophrenia\nHemispheric cooperation in the right caudate nucleus was significantly greater in patients with schizophrenia than healthy controls, in accordance with the results of a previous study. (37) The striatum and associated cortical structures contribute to many cognitive and affective processes that are affected in schizophrenia, (38-40) and the caudate nucleus is an important node within corticostriatal circuits. Consistent with this finding, several studies have also reported abnormalities in caudate anatomy. (41-43) Moreover, the classic dopamine hypothesis posits that the positive symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with hyperactive dopaminergic transmission within the caudate, (44,45) and mean dopamine system densities were correlated with the alteration in mean CFH in the current study. Taken together, these results provide evidence that abnormal FC within the right caudate nucleus, possibly involving dopaminergic system dysfunction, contributes to schizophrenia pathology.\nPatients with schizophrenia also showed significantly reduced interhemispheric cooperation in a large span of the frontal lobes encompassing the left middle OFC, right superior OFC and right medial OFC. Damage to the OFC affects cognitive functions, emotion regulation and social behaviours, resulting in a host of psychiatric syndromes. (46-48) Structural and functional impairment of the OFC have been reported in patients with schizophrenia. For example, studies have provided evidence of volume and thickness reductions of the OFC in medication-naive patients with schizophrenia. (49,50) Previous fMRI studies have shown altered OFC activation during social decision-making in patients with schizophrenia. (51) People with OFC damage have been shown to make disastrous life choices, such as bad investments or breaking the law. (46) Finally, using voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity, interhemispheric cooperation in the OFC has been found to be significantly decreased in schizophrenia. (18) While our current findings support those of previous neuroimaging studies, the characterization of the role of the OFC is complicated by multiple factors. More research is therefore needed to demonstrate the role of the OFC in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.\nWe also found significantly reduced CFH values in the right ITG and left postcentral gyrus. The temporal cortex is a key structure for auditory and language processing, both of which are impaired in schizophrenia. (52,53) Consistent with our findings, several previous studies have reported impaired interhemispheric cooperation in the temporal cortex of patients with schizophrenia. (15,16) In addition, several morphometric studies have reported structure deficits in the temporal gyrus of patients with schizophrenia. (54-57) Our findings suggest that impaired connectivity with the right ITG may contribute to schizophrenia pathology. Furthermore, this dysfunction appears to worsen with disease progression, as we found a negative correlation between interhemispheric cooperation and disease duration. The postcentral gyrus receives and processes somatosensory information, (58-60) and reduced interhemispheric cooperation of the postcentral gyrus has also been reported in schizophrenia. (9,15) A growing body of literature indicates that the somatosensory cortex contributes to emotional and cognitive processing, and impaired somatosensory processing is a common symptom of schizophrenia. (61) Future studies are warranted to examine whether sensory impairments in schizophrenia contribute to deficits in higher-order cognition.\nCorrelations with molecular substrate densities\nNeurotransmitter receptors and transporters support the propagation of signals and shape network-wide communication in the human brain. The dopamine hypothesis was the first neurochemical theory of schizophrenia, and it is still widely accepted to explain some symptoms of the disorder. (62) We found that group differences in CFH between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls were significantly correlated with the densities of [D.sub.1R], [D.sub.2R], [DA.sub.T] and F-DOPA. The dopamine system is implicated in motor behaviour, cognition and emotion, all of which are affected by schizophrenia. (63) The classic formulation of the dopamine hypothesis posits that hypoactive dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex leads to negative symptoms such as flat affect and anhedonia, while hyperactivity of mesolimbic dopamine neurons leads to positive symptoms. (45,64) This theory is strongly supported by the efficacy of dopamine receptor antagonists to treat behavioural and cognitive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.\nHowever, it has long been appreciated that dopaminergic dysfunction alone cannot account for the full spectrum of psychopathology in schizophrenia. (65,66) Consistent with contributions of serotonergic and cholinergic signalling dysfunctions in schizophrenia, we found significant positive correlations between the mean group difference in CFH and the densities of [5-HT.sub.T], [GABA.sub.AR] and [VACh.sub.T]. The serotonin system interacts with the dopamine system at multiple levels. Moreover, [5-HT.sub.T] signalling is critical for proper neurodevelopment, and the appearance of prodromal symptoms before clinical disease suggests neurodevelopmental deficits in schizophrenia. Furthermore, changes in [5-HT.sub.T] are associated with cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia. (67) Associations of both serotonergic dysfunction and [5-HT.sub.T] polymorphisms (68) with schizophrenia pathophysiology have also been reported. (66,69) Moreover, some newly developed antipsychotic medications preferentially target the serotonin system. (70,71) The pathophysiology of schizophrenia and/or symptom expression may also involve altered cholinergic transmission. Tobacco smoking rates are high among patients with schizophrenia, suggesting self-medication with nicotine (a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor [[nACh.sub.R]] agonist). (72-75) Reduced expression of [alpha]7 ionotropic [nACh.sub.R] expression has been observed in the postmortem hippocampus and cingulate cortex of patients with schizophrenia. (74,76) The role of GABA in patients with schizophrenia has also been reported in clinical and basic neuroscience studies. (77,78) The GABA system has been shown to be effective in improving symptoms of schizophrenia. (79)\nRecent studies have implicated glutamate and norepinephrine in addition to dopamine, serotonin, GABA and acetylcholine in the pathobiology of schizophrenia. (80) However, our findings show that the density maps of these neurotransmitter receptors and transporters were independent of the CFH group differences. These molecular substrates may be involved in other cognitive dysfunction or symptoms of schizophrenia, but not in interhemispheric cooperation. Our findings may provide a host of additional therapeutic targets for schizophrenia. However, further research is needed to elucidate the potential therapeutic mechanisms and roles of different neurotransmitters in the treatment of schizophrenia.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, all patients with schizophrenia were treated with antipsychotic medications before the scan, which could have had unpredictable effects on our findings. Therefore, the alterations of interhemispheric cooperation should be investigated in drug-naive patients with schizophrenia. Second, we used a cross-sectional design to investigate interhemispheric cooperation. A longitudinal study is necessary to assess how abnormalities in interhemispheric cooperation emerge and change with disease progression. Third, the sample sizes of some receptor and transporter atlases were relatively small and came from healthy individuals. Atlases from a large sample of patients with schizophrenia are necessary to validate our findings.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusion\nWe have shown that interhemispheric cooperation is significantly altered in patients with schizophrenia and that these alterations are associated with clinical symptoms. In addition, region of interest-based analysis showed markedly reduced FC between bilateral frontal lobes in patients with schizophrenia. Finally, abnormal CFH values were correlated with the densities of several neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. Interventions to enhance interhemispheric cooperation, especially in the frontal lobe, may be an effective treatment strategy for schizophrenia.\nAcknowledgment: The authors thank the participants for taking part in this study.

        "abstract": "The evidence for the hemispheric specialization of motor planning reveals several inconsistencies between the left-lateralized hypothesis and a distributed system across the hemispheres. We compared participants with left hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP) to right-handed control subjects in this study's first experiment by inviting them to perform a motor planning task. Participants were required to release the start button, grasp a hexagon, and rotate it according to the instructions. In the second experiment, we compared left-HCP subjects with right-HCP subjects inviting them to perform the same task (we used the data for left-HCP subjects from the first experiment). P2 amplitude, as well as planning time, grasping time, releasing time, and initial grip selection planning patterns, were used as outcome measures in both experiments. The first experiment revealed that controls acted more quickly and chose more effective planning patterns. Also, the P2 amplitude was smaller in left-HCP subjects than in control subjects. No significant group effect was observed in the second experiment for any movement-related measure or P2. At the neural level, however, there was an interaction between 'region' and 'group,' indicating the distinction between the two groups in the right region. The results are discussed in terms of motor planning's hemispheric distribution and individual differences in the HCP group.\nAuthor(s): Neda Sadeghi 1 , Mohammad Taghi Joghataei 2 1 , Ali Shahbazi 2 1 , Seyed Hassan Tonekaboni 3 , Hale Akrami 4 , Mohammad Ali Nazari 1\nAuthor Affiliations:\n(1) grid.411746.1, 0000 0004 4911 7066, Department of Neuroscience, Faculty of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, , Shahid Hemmat Exp. way, Tehran, Iran\n(2) grid.411746.1, 0000 0004 4911 7066, Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, , Tehran, Iran\n(3) grid.411600.2, Pediatric Neurology Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, , Tehran, Iran\n(4) grid.42505.36, 0000 0001 2156 6853, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, , Los Angeles, USA",
        "introduction": "Introduction\nCerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological disease characterized by non-progressive movement and posture disorders (Rosenbaum et al. 2007). In individuals with hemiplegic CP (HCP), the lesions lead to contralateral motor deficits. Individuals with HCP employ compensatory movement patterns when grasping objects with the affected hand, e.g., the step-by-step strategy, in which they plan the sequence of an action one by one rather than anticipating and planning the entire sequence of the upcoming action (Mutsaarts et al. 2005; Steenbergen et al. 2004; Trombly 1992, 1993). These specific movement patterns are also apparent in the unaffected hand, increasing the number of sub-movements (Hung and Meredith 2014; Rich et al. 2017; Souto et al. 2021).\nVarious behavioral studies indicated that specific motor difficulties in HCP patients are associated with deficits in motor planning (Duff and Gordon 2003; Mutsaarts et al. 2006; Steenbergen and Gordon 2006; Steenbergen et al. 2007, 2013). Electrophysiological studies suggest that motor execution deficits in these patients result from abnormal neural activities in the preparation phase before the onset of the movement (Van Elk et al. 2010a, b; Kurz et al. 2014). Maladaptive muscle activation patterns, e.g., spasticity and weakness, appear when the timing process is impaired (Sanger et al. 2010). Event-related potentials (ERPs) allow assessing the precise temporal resolution and measuring the time scales of the motor planning process, i.e., an area omitted in fMRI studies. A deeper understanding of the nature of higher-level problems (i.e., motor planning deficits) is necessary for successful therapeutic intervention.\nTwo regulatory systems govern human actions. The habitual system chooses actions based on the requirements of the current task. In comparison, the goal-directed system anticipates the conclusion of upcoming actions and selects actions accordingly (Daw et al. 2005; de Wit and Dickinson 2009; Dolan and Dayan 2013; Morris et al. 2016). Computational evidence demonstrated that the goal-directed system achieves the best possible outcome at the expense of energy and time; however, habitual action selection is faster and easier, but it is incapable of changing in light of environmental goals (Hardwick et al. 2018). The goal-directed system programs the motor plans and develops the action strategies by considering the future demands of the task and the environment (Johnson-Frey et al. 2004; Steenbergen et al. 2004; Mutsaarts et al. 2005, 2006). Motor planning, in general, refers to all cognitive and motor processes that occur during the preparation phase of a movement's reaction time. Wong et al. (2014) propose a more limited definition of motor planning as three \"how\" processes that work in concert to configure the movement to achieve the motor goal, namely action selection, abstract kinematics, and movement specification. These processes can occur almost instantly, necessitating using a technique with a high temporal resolution to capture the time course of each. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that people prefer to complete tasks in comfortable positions, even if they are forced to begin in uncomfortable positions. This effect is referred to as \"end-state comfort,\" and it serves as the foundation for motor planning assessments (Rosenbaum et al. 1990, 2001).\nSeveral studies supporting the left-hemispheric dominance hypothesis for motor planning have extensively focused on right-handed participants (Schluter et al. 1998, 2001; Haaland et al. 2004). This is a significant limitation that might lead to an apparent bias. In fact, the observed results may be the result of practice and experience with the right hand, rather than a generic left-hemisphere specialization for motor planning. A few studies on motor control in left-handed individuals have produced mixed results. For example, Janssen et al. (2009, 2011) investigated the motor planning process in the right and left-handed participants using a bimanual grasping task. The participants were instructed to grasp CD cases and put them in CD boxes with a specific orientation. The study found that the end-state comfort effect was only observed for the right hand in both groups, confirming the left-hemispheric dominance hypothesis for motor planning.\nIn contrast, Hughes et al. (2011) observed no difference in motor planning between left and right-handed individuals, showing that the initial grasp postures were similar for both dominant and non-dominant hands. Moreover, Sadeghi et al. (2021) investigated the hemispheric distribution of motor planning by comparing right and left-handed participants in an action selection task. The participants were instructed to perform the task with their dominant hands (corresponding to the dominant hemisphere). The results revealed no significant difference between the groups regarding movement-related measures (i.e., planning time, grasping time, and releasing time), and both right and left-handed participants used the same planning pattern for the initial grip selection.\nAnother body of research on patients with unilateral brain damage has produced contradictory evidence favoring the hemispheric distribution of motor planning. Some evidence supports the left-hemisphere dominance for motor planning, claiming that patients with left brain damage suffer from more severe motor planning deficits than patients with right brain damage (Haaland and Harrington 1996; Vingerhoets 2008; Steenbergen et al. 2004Craje et al. 2009). However, there is evidence that contradicts this hypothesis. Kirkpatrick et al. (2013) found no differences between children with right and left-HCP when performing an action planning task with the unaffected arm. Williams et al. (2011) showed that both right and left spastic hemiplegia children had similar response time and accuracy rates for the hand rotation task. Moreover, Dean et al. (2012) reported no differences between right and left hemiplegia from a stroke. As a result, it remains difficult to argue for a hemispheric distribution of motor planning; and it is unclear whether left-HCP or right-HCP patients experience more motor planning difficulties.\nBrain reorganization is another critical point when discussing the hemispheric contribution of motor planning, particularly in the case of early brain damage. Cortical projections in children with unilateral cerebral palsy do not follow the typical contralateral pattern. The projections, instead, are reorganized into an ipsilateral or mixed pattern (Carr et al. 1993; Carneiro et al. 2020; Baranello et al. 2016; Williams et al. 2011). Furthermore, studies have shown that in patients with unilateral cerebral palsy, the hemisphere receiving afferent projections, including sensory information, may not correspond to the hemisphere sending efferent projections (Thickbroom et al. 2001). Weinstein et al. (2018) demonstrated the beneficial utilizing of multiple modalities (EEG, fMRI, TMS, EMG, and DTI) to assess hand function in patients with unilateral cerebral palsy, indicating multiple individual reorganization patterns.\nMoreover, neurophysiological evidence established the complexity and variability of functional abilities in children with unilateral cerebral palsy. For instance, Ferre et al. (2020) used an atlas-based analysis to demonstrate that children with periventricular injuries performed significantly better on dexterity and bimanual hand function tests than children with middle cerebral artery injuries. Additionally, certain studies have indicated that the location and timing of the brain insult are unique to each child with unilateral cerebral palsy, resulting in individual differences despite a unitary diagnosis (Gupta et al. 2017; Dobson et al. 2011; Staudt et al. 2004).\nIn the present study, we investigated the hemispheric distribution of motor planning in two experiments. It is necessary to use a task sensitive to motor planning ability to evaluate motor planning ability. Thus, we selected an action selection task for the experiments. The action selection process is one of the crucial steps in motor planning, which requires selecting proper motor programs (Andersen and Cui 2009; Wong et al. 2014). For instance, when you choose to write with a pen, you must consider a different grip than when you wish to pass the pen on to a friend sitting beside you (Daprati and Sirigu 2006). Accordingly, we studied a specific handle-turning task in which participants would decide to rotate their hands and choose the proper grip for rotating the knob in different rotational angles and directions. Due to the electrophysiological nature of the study (i.e., ERP), it can provide appropriate measures for investigating cognitive processes underlying motor planning or \"how\" processes with temporal resolution. The ERP analysis focused on the P2 component, a positive ERP deflection over the frontocentral areas of the brain, and the neural correlate of action selection (K\u00fchn et al., 2009; Smid et al., 1999). The P2 component, whether anterior P2 or P2a, peaked at approximately 200 ms after stimulus onset (Makeig et al. 1999; Potts 2004; Van Elk et al. 2010a, b). The P2 amplitude indicated a stimulus categorization mechanism, with higher amplitudes associated with increased processing and more complex stimulus characteristics (Van Elk et al., 2010a, b; Luck and Hillyard, 1994). Previous studies suggested that P2 amplitude could be associated with predicting an upcoming action (Nikolaev et al. 2008) and stimulus-response coupling (Gajewski and Falkenstein 2013; Gajewski et al. 2008). For example, Van Elk et al. (2010a, b) showed a weak action selection process in participants with unilateral cerebral palsy correlated with a substantial reduction in P2 amplitude. Experiment 1 focused on the left-hemisphere hypothesis for motor planning and compared left-HCP participants and right-handed control subjects. In Experiment 2, we compared left- and right-HCP participants to examine hemispheric control of action selection.\nExperiment 1\nWe examined the hemispheric specialization of motor planning in the first experiment by comparing left-HCP and healthy right-handed control subjects. We instructed both groups to complete the task using only their right hand (the unaffected hand and the dominant hand in left-HCP and control subjects, respectively). Some studies support the left-hemisphere hypothesis for motor planning, demonstrating that deficits in motor planning are more pronounced when the left hemisphere is damaged (the right body side is affected) (Haaland and Harrington 1996; Vingerhoets 2008; Steenbergen et al. 2004; Craje et al. 2009). In line with this behavioral research, an electrophysiological study found that the overall P2 amplitude was approximately half that of control subjects in right-HCP participants (left-brain damage) (Van Elk et al. 2010a, b).\nIn contrast, some evidence refuted this hypothesis (Kirkpatrick et al. 2013; Williams et al. 2011; Dean et al. 2012). However, evidence regarding the complexity and variability of function in children with UCP is growing (Ferre et al. 2020; Weinstein et al. 2018; Gupta et al. 2017; Dobson et al. 2011; Staudt et al. 2004). Thus, given the brain reorganization, complexity, and heterogeneity of children with UCP, it is challenging to conclude excessive motor planning deficits or a lack of motor planning deficits in children with right hemiplegia as compensatory motor planning mechanisms and individual differences may be expected in the UCP group. Thus, no substantial evidence exists for hemispheric dominance in motor planning. The primary objective of the first experiment was to compare left-HCP and healthy right-handed control subjects' motor planning ability during a specific action selection task. We specifically examined the possibility of significant differences between the two groups in terms of P2 amplitude, movement-related measures, and initial grip selection planning patterns. Additionally, the effects of task complexity were examined on both the behavioral and neural levels.",
        "methodology": "Methods (1)\nParticipants\nThe study included 12 participants diagnosed with left hemiplegic cerebral palsy (5 females, mean age = 25.7 years, SD = 3.36 years) and 14 neurologically healthy right-handed participants (9 females, mean age = 27.5 years, SD = 2.34 years) (see Table 1). Prior to the experiment, we assessed the ability of left-HCP and control and right-HCP subjects to deduce relationships using Raven's Progressive Matrices (the Standard version). Tables 2 and 3 show the mean \u00b1 standard deviation and t-test results for these three groups. Participants with HCP were recruited through outpatient rehabilitation centers voluntarily. They all possessed the necessary sitting balance and cognitive abilities to complete the task. Gross and fine manual skills were examined using the Box and Blocks test (gross dexterity, Mathiowetz et al. 1985) and the Purdue Pegboard test (fine dexterity, Tiffin 1985) for both affected and unaffected hands. We calculated a ratio for the severity of the affected hand's paresis and divided the affected hand's score by the unaffected hand's score. To this end, a score near 1 indicates mild paresis, with comparable hand function in both hands, whereas a score near 0 indicates severe paresis, with a significant difference in hand function between the impaired and unimpaired hand. The data for participants with HCP are provided in Tables 2 and 3.

All control participants were right-handed, as assessed by the four-item version of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (scores [greater than or equal to] 61 indicate right-handedness and scores [less than or equal to] 61 indicate left-handedness) (Veale 2014). All participants gave informed consent prior to the experiment. The study was approved by the Research Committee of Iran University of Medical Science (IR.IUMS.FMD.REC1396.9321959005) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964).\nExperimental setup\nThe experimental setup consisted of a custom-made wedge (width: 40 cm) with a 45 \u00cd\u00a6 slope relative to the horizontal surface and a hexagonal plastic knob (width: 11 cm, depth: 6 cm) attached to the center of the wedge (Fig. 1A). The apparatus was placed on a table, and the participants were instructed to sit comfortably on a chair behind the apparatus and adjust their position to reach a suitable posture for performing the task. The hexagonal knob could fluidly rotate around the vertical axis. A touch sensor on each of the six sides of the knob recorded the maximum touch surface to detect the initial grip patterns. Subjects were required to grasp the hexagon with their thumb and fingers placed on opposite sides of it. As a result, they touched only two opposite sides of the hexagonal knob, and a sensor detected the position of the fingers in front of the thumb (the surface with the maximum touch).Fig. 1\nA The experimental setup for motor planning assessment adapted from Mutsaart (2006). B The six grip patterns with the right hand (Grip 1-5, described in more details in Part C; Grip 4 was biomechanically impossible for all the participants). C Diagram indicating six possible locations of the four fingers in front of the thumb detected by the touch sensor, which is called Grip 1, Grip 2, and so on. D The schematic course of a trial of the task: holding the button, turning on the LEDs, releasing the button, grasping the hexagon, and finally releasing the hexagon and going back to the starting position\nSubjects could grasp the hexagonal knob using five different grip types (i.e., Grip 1, Grip 2, Grip 3, Grip 5, and Grip 6). Grip 4 was biomechanically impossible for all the participants (see Fig. 1B, C). An arrow (width: 0.5 cm, length: 15 cm) was inserted on each of the knobs' six sides. Six LEDs were placed at 0 \u00cd\u00a6, 60 \u00cd\u00a6, 120 \u00cd\u00a6, 180 \u00cd\u00a6, 240 \u00cd\u00a6, and 300 \u00cd\u00a6 of the wedge. There was a start button in front of the wedge to allow the subjects to start the grasping movements. A PC running the presentation software (the motor planning system, TIWAN Technology Development Co.) controlled both the start button and the portable wedge to turn on the LEDs, record the movement-related measures, and detect the directions rotation angles. The movement-related measures included the planning time (i.e., the time in which the subject released the start button), the grasping time (i.e., the time between releasing the start button and grasping the knob), and the release time (i.e., the time between grasping and rotating the hexagonal knob). Different triggers corresponding to various task conditions were used to identify the events over the EEG signals and saved for the ERP analysis.\nExperimental procedure\nBefore the experiment, the participants were informed to place one hand on the start button. HCP subjects performed our task with their unaffected hand to reduce the impact of biomechanical abnormalities such as spasticity, muscle tightness, and contracture, which was consistent with previous research involving participants with unilateral brain damage (Mutsaarts et al. 2005; Steenbergen et al. 2004; Van Elk et al. 2010a, b; Kirkpatrick et al. 2013). After choosing the most suitable planning pattern, participants were asked to release the start button, grasp the hexagon, and complete the rotation. Once the initial trial was completed, participants returned to the starting position and initiated the subsequent trial. The LED instructions included four different conditions, i.e., 60\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 clockwise (CW), and 60\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 counterclockwise (CCW). For example, if LEDs 1 and 2 were lit, the hexagon was required to be rotated 60\u00b0 in the CW direction; however, if LEDs 1, 2, 3, and 4 were lit, the hexagon was required to be rotated 180\u00b0 in the CW direction. Participants were instructed to release the start button as soon as they determined which grip to grab. Then, they would grab the hexagonal knob and complete the rotation in the pre-cued directions and rotational angles. Participants were free to select one of five possible grips. Each time the initial rotation was carried out, the hand returned to the start button to initiate the subsequent trial. The task consisted of 120 trials (2 directions x 2 rotation angles x 30 repetitions) sorted in random order.\nThe subjects had to perform the experiment as quickly as possible. At the beginning of the task, subjects were instructed to place their hand over the hexagonal knob and determine the most comfortable grip pattern. They all stated that Grip 1 (the one without a rotation) was the most comfortable. Before starting the main experiment, the subjects practiced a few trials to ensure the task was fully understood.\nBehavioral data analysis\nThe behavioral data analysis focused on planning times, grasping times, releasing times, and initial grip selection planning patterns. The planning time was the time between turning on the LEDs and releasing the start button. The grasping time was the time between releasing the start button and grasping the hexagonal knob. The releasing time was the time between grasping the knob and releasing it after rotation (see Fig. 1D). The outlier data were omitted from the analysis's subsequent steps. The initial grips were coded by the touch sensor according to the location of the fingers in front of the thumb (see Fig. 1C).\nTo analyze the initial grip selections, three planning patterns were identified: no-planning pattern, effective-planning pattern, and wrong-planning pattern. Grip 1 (without a rotation grip) was defined as the no-planning pattern. Due to the dominance of the habitual system, simple methods are used without regard for future actions, which is a representation of the no-planning pattern (Hardwick et al. 2018). Therefore, the end-state comfort satisfaction is only provided for 60-degree rotations. In 180-degree rotations, subjects needed to rotate their hands in the opposite direction of the guided rotatory movements, i.e., they could not perform the task in comfortable postures. Therefore, Grip 5 and Grip 6 represented effective-planning patterns for rotatory movements in CW directions, while Grip 2 and Grip 3 represented effective-planning patterns for rotatory movements in CCW directions. The pattern of effective planning exemplified the use of a goal-directed system that predicts an action's future requirements (de Wit and Dickinson 2009). If subjects rotated their hands in the same direction at the start of rotatory movements, they would be unable to complete the task, or their hands would be left in an awkward position. To this end, Grips 2 and 3 were defined as wrong-planning patterns for rotatory movements in CW directions, while Grips 5 and 6 were defined as wrong-planning patterns for rotatory movements in CCW directions.\nEEG recording and analysis\nWe recorded electroencephalogram (EEG; [mu]V) signals using a 32-channel amplifier (ANT Neuro, Enschede, Netherlands). Electrode array on Waveguard cap (ANT Neuro, Enschede, Netherlands) was based on the 10-20 system arrangement. All electrodes were referenced to the average of the left and right mastoids. To monitor both vertical and horizontal eye movements, we recorded the electrooculogram (EOG) signals using two electrodes placed below and adjacent to the left eye. The sampling rate of the amplifier was 625 Hz. The impedance of each electrode was kept below 10 k Ohm. An independent component analysis (ICA) procedure was used to remove ocular and movement artifacts (Delorme and Makeig 2004). Following ICA, a specialist excluded trials with movement artifacts from analysis based on a thorough visual examination of the raw data. For the ERP analysis, we used a 0.5 to 30 Hz two-pass finite impulse-response band pass filter (order: 3 cycles of the low-frequency cutoff) to filter the data.\nThe ERP analysis was performed during the planning time interval (the time between LEDs' cues and the release of the start button). ERPs were computed relative to the LEDs' cue from - 200 to 500 ms using the baseline time window of - 200 to 0 ms. Statistical analyses were focused on the amplitude of the P2 wave as the average of the amplitude from 180 to 220 ms post-stimulus onset. The average P2 amplitude was calculated on Fz and Cz electrodes. The averages of artifact-free trials were 114.83 \u00b1 5.73 and 109.78 \u00b1 8.47 in the left-HCP and control group, respectively [t (24) = 1.74, P = 0.09].\nMethods (2)\nParticipants\nFor the second experiment, 12 participants with left-HCP (5 females, mean age = 25.75 years, SD = 3.36 years) and nine with right-HCP (3 females, mean age = 24.66 years, SD = 5.87 years) volunteered to participate. As with Experiment 1, participants with right-HCP were referred to the second experiment by outpatient rehabilitation centers. Moreover, they all signed the consent form before the experiment. The criteria for selecting participants for Experiment 2 were the same as those of Experiment 1, listed in Table 2.\nEEG recording and analysis\nSimilar to Experiment 1, the P2 amplitude was analyzed offline as the average amplitude from 180 to 220 ms after stimulus onset; however, this time, at three regions of interest (ROI), i.e., the left fronto-central ROI (F3, FC1, and C3), the fronto-central ROI (Fz and Cz), and the right fronto-central ROI (F4, FC2, and C4). ERPs were tested for statistical significance using a 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 general linear model (GLM) with 'rotation' (60\u00b0 vs. 180\u00b0) and 'direction' (CCW vs. CW directions) and region (left-ROI, central-ROI, and right-ROI) as within-subject variables and 'group' (left-HCP subjects vs. control subjects) as the between-subjects factor. The left region was evaluated because it appears that the left hemisphere is critical for motor planning. On the other hand, the right region was assessed because some studies have confirmed the right hemisphere's role in mental rotation (Serrien et al. 2006). Furthermore, we evaluated the central region (i.e., the visual processing pathway) because Van Elk et al. (2010a, b) hypothesize that this area is where action selection occurs. Finally, because we assessed the left-hemisphere dominance hypothesis for motor planning to the distributed theory, which postulates bilateral motor planning, we evaluated three regions of interest.\nThe averages of artifact-free trials were 114.83 \u00b1 5.73 and 114 \u00b1 6.30 in the left- and right-HCP group, respectively [t (19) = - 0.31, P = 0.75].\nDelorme, A, Makeig, S15102499: EEGLAB: an open source toolbox for analysis of single-trial EEG dynamics including independent component analysis. vol. 134, issue 1, pp. 9-21.

        "results": "Results (1)\nBehavioral data\nThe behavioral data analysis focused on planning, grasping, and releasing times. A 2 x 2 x 2 repeated measures general linear model (GLM) was used with 'direction' (counterclockwise vs. clockwise) and 'rotation angle' (60\u00b0 vs. 180\u00b0) as within-subject variables and 'group' (left-HCP subjects vs. control subjects) as the between-subjects factor. The planning time analyses showed a main effect for 'rotation' [F (1, 24) = 22.55, P < 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.48], indicating that increased rotation angles were associated with increased planning times (see Fig. 2A). There was a main effect for 'direction' [F (1, 24) = 6.11, P = 0.021, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.2], suggesting that planning times were slower for CW directions compared to CCW directions. An interaction effect was found for 'direction' x 'rotation' [F (1, 24) = 8.22, P = 0.008, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.25]. Two paired t -tests were performed separately between the directions, in which the planning time was significantly higher at 180\u00b0 CW than 180\u00b0 CCW [t (25) = 2.96, P = 0.007], whereas such a significant difference was not observed in 60\u00b0 rotations [t (25) = - 0.61, P = 0.54]. Moreover, an interaction between 'direction' x 'rotation' x 'group' was found [F (1, 24) = 5.57, P = 0.027, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.18].Fig. 2\nBehavioral results of the first experiment. Graphs representing planning times (A ), grasping times (B ), releasing times (C ), the distribution of the planning patterns used by left-HCP subjects (black bars) and control subjects (white bars) (D ), the distribution of the planning patterns in two different directions CW (black bars) and CCW (white bars) (E ) and the distribution of the planning patterns in two different rotation angles 60\u00b0 (black bars) and 180\u00b0 (white bars) (F ). Error bars indicate \u00b1 1 SE\nWe performed paired t -tests separately for each group, indicating that left-HCP subjects had significantly higher planning time in 180\u00b0 CW than CCW [t (11) = 2.77, P = 0.018]; however, for the rotation angles of 60\u00b0, this difference was not significant [t (11) = - 0.94, P = 0.36]. There was no significant difference in planning time between 60\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 in CCW and CW direction in control subjects. A main effect was found for 'group' [F (1, 24) = 11.25, P = 0.003, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.31], indicating slower planning times for left-HCP subjects (average planning time = 693.06 ms, SE = 48.23 ms) compared to the control group (average planning time = 472.52 ms, SE = 44.65 ms). On the other hand, the control group acted faster.\nThe analysis of grasping times also showed a significant main effect for 'rotation' [F (1, 24) = 28.93, P \u00cb 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.54], indicating that grasping times were slower for greater angle rotations (e.g., 180\u00b0) compared to smaller rotation angles (e.g., 60\u00b0) (see Fig. 2B). A main effect for 'direction' [F (1, 24) = 6.08, P = 0.021, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.2] indicated that grasping times were slower for CW directions (i.e., LEDs instruction: 1, 2, 3, and 4) than CCW directions (i.e., LEDs instruction: 1, 6, 5, and 4). As was the case with planning time, an interaction effect was observed between 'direction' and 'rotation' [F (1, 24) = 4.4, P = 0.04, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.15]. Two paired t -tests confirmed the results, indicating the grasping time was significantly higher at 180\u00b0 CW than 180\u00b0 CCW [t (25) = 2.90, P = 0.008]; however, there was no significant difference for grasping time in 60\u00b0 CCW than CW direction [t (25) = 0.18, P = 0.85]. There was no significant effect for 'group' [F (1, 24) = 3.28, P = 0.08, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.12].\nAs expected, the analysis of releasing times revealed a main effect for 'rotation' [F (1, 24) = 79.23, P \u00cb 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.76], indicating slower releasing times for greater angle rotations (e.g., 180\u00b0) compared to smaller angle rotations (e.g., 60\u00b0) (see Fig. 2C). There was no main effect for 'direction' [F (1, 24) = 0.36, P = 0.55, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.01], and no main effect was observed for 'group' [F (1, 24) = 0.02, P = 0.88, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.001].\nThe analysis of planning patterns for the initial grip selection was performed using a 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 repeated measures general linear model (GLM) with 'direction' (counterclockwise vs. clockwise), 'rotation angle' (60\u00b0 vs. 180\u00b0), and 'planning pattern' (no-planning pattern vs. effective-planning pattern vs. wrong-planning pattern) as within-subject variables and 'group' (left-HCP subjects vs. control subjects) as the between-subjects factor. In analyzing planning patterns for the initial grip selection, the main effect was found for 'planning pattern' [F (2, 48) = 40.12, P \u00cb 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.62], indicating that the effective-planning pattern was used more often than the two other patterns (i.e., no-planning pattern and wrong-planning pattern).\nA significant interaction was found between 'planning pattern' x 'group' [F (2, 48) = 5.06, P = 0.01, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.17]. Three independent t -tests were performed separately between grip patterns. Regarding the no-planning pattern, the difference between the two groups was not significant [t (24) = - 1.13, P = 0.26], indicating both groups selected the no-planning pattern equally. However, there was a significant difference between groups in terms of the effective-planning pattern [t (24) = 2.89, P = 0.008], implying that the control group grasped the hexagon with better motor planning (average number of selection of the effective-planning pattern per category = 72.2, SD = 5.2) compared to left-HCP subjects (average number of selection of the effective-planning pattern per category = 49.93, SD = 5.6). In addition, a significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of the wrong-planning pattern [t (24) = - 3.21, P = 0.004], demonstrating that the left-HCP subjects often selected an inappropriate grip (average number of selection of the wrong-planning pattern per category = 12.91, SD = 2.8) compared to the control group (average number of selection of the wrong-planning pattern per category = 0.35, SD = 2.6).\nThere was an interaction between 'planning pattern' x 'direction' [F (2, 48) = 18.69, P < 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.43], indicating that the effective-planning patterns were more often used for CCW directions. Paired t -tests confirmed these results [t (25) = - 4.92, P < 0.001]. Moreover, there was an interaction effect between 'planning pattern' x 'rotation' [F (2, 48) = 27.86, P \u00cb 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.53], indicating that the effective-planning patterns were more often used for 180\u00b0 rotations, whereas subjects preferred the no-planning patterns for 60\u00b0 rotations. Paired t -tests analysis showed that there were significant differences between these two rotation angles in the no-planning pattern [t (25) = 4.55, P \u00cb 0.001] and the effective-planning pattern [t (25) = - 5.08, P \u00cb 0.001]; however, there was no significant difference between them in the wrong-planning pattern [t (25) = 0.72, P = 0.47]. These results are depicted in Fig. 2D.\nEvent-related potentials (ERPs)\nERPs were tested for statistical significance using a 2 x 2 x 2 general linear model (GLM) with 'rotation' (60\u00b0 vs. 180\u00b0) and 'direction' (CCW vs. CW directions) as within-subject variables and 'group' (left-HCP subjects vs. control subjects) as the between-subjects factor. Figure 3 depicts the ERPs for left-HCP and control subjects during the motor planning task. A main effect for 'group' was observed [F (1, 24) = 5.13, P = 0.03, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.17]. As indicated in Fig. 3A, participants in the left-HCP group showed a lower P2 amplitude (average amplitude = 2.46 [mu]V, SE = 0.41 [mu]V) compared to the healthy right-handed control subjects (average amplitude = 3.74 [mu]V, SE = 0.38 [mu]V). There was a main effect for 'rotation' [F (1, 24) = 28.79, P \u00cb 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.54], indicating that an increase in the P2 amplitude was associated with an increase in the rotation angle (Fig. 3B). A main effect was found for 'direction' [F (1, 24) = 7.01, P = 0.014, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.22], showing a higher P2 amplitude for CW directions compared to CCW directions (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3\nNeural results of the first experiment.

D Graphs representing the scalp topography of the P2 component\nResults (2)\nBehavioral data\nThe second experiment's behavioral data were analyzed statistically in the same way as Experiment 1. A 2 x 2 x 2 repeated measures general linear model (GLM) was used with 'direction' (counterclockwise vs. clockwise) and 'rotation angle' (60\u00b0 vs. 180\u00b0) as within-subject variables and 'group' (right-HCP vs. left-HCP subjects) as the between-subjects factor. There was a significant main effect for 'rotation' on planning time [F (1, 19) = 21.34, P \u00cb 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.52], indicating that the planning time increased with greater rotation angles (see Fig. 4A). No main effect was observed for 'direction' [F (1, 19) = 2.34, P = 0.14, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.11]. There was an interaction effect for 'direction' x 'group' [F (1, 19) = 14.36, P = 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.43]. The paired t -test revealed that the right-HCP group was significantly slower in CCW directions than in CW directions [t (8) = 3.32, P = 0.01]. However, such a significant difference was not observed in the left-HCP group [t (11) = - 1.8, P = 0.09] (see Fig. 5). An interaction between 'direction' x 'rotation' x 'group' [F (1, 19) = 7.5, P = 0.01, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.28] indicated that the right-HCP group was faster at 180\u00b0 CW than CCW [t (8) = - 3.22, P = 0.01]; however, for the rotation angles of 60\u00b0, this difference was not significant [t (8) = - 1.97, P = 0.08]. The left-HCP group was faster in CCW directions, but only for the 180\u00b0 rotation [t (11) = 2.77, P = 0.01]. No effect was found for 'group' [F (1, 19) = 0.001, P = 0.98, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.001].Fig. 4\nBehavioral results of the second experiment.

Error bars indicate \u00b1 1 SE\nFig. 5\nGraphs representing the 'direction' x 'group' interaction in planning times (A ), grasping times (B ), and releasing times (C ). The interaction of 'direction' x 'group' is not significant as presented in Part C. In general, the effect of 'group' is not significant. Error bars indicate \u00b1 1 SE\nAnalyzing grasping times indicated a significant main effect for 'rotation' [F (1, 19) = 27.68, P \u00cb 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.59], indicating longer grasping times for greater rotation angles (e.g., 180\u00b0) compared to smaller rotation angles (e.g., 60\u00b0) (see Fig. 4B). No main effect was found for 'direction' [F (1, 19) = 2.44, P = 0.13, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.11]. There was an interaction effect for 'direction' x 'group' [F (1, 19) = 6.3, P = 0.02, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.24]. As was the case for the planning time, we performed two paired t-tests, showing that the right-HCP group was slower in CCW directions than in CW directions [t (8) = - 2.2, P = 0.05]. On the other hand, the left-HCP group acted faster in CCW directions; however, their action was not significant [t (11) = 0.9, P = 0.38] (see Fig. 5). There was no significant effect for 'group' [F (1, 19) = 0.03, P = 0.84, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.002].\nAnalyzing releasing times revealed a main effect for 'rotation' [F (1, 19) = 43.25, P \u00cb 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.69], indicating that the subjects spent longer releasing times for greater rotation angles (e.g., 180\u00b0) compared to smaller rotation angles (e.g., 60\u00b0) (see Fig. 4C). There was no effect for 'direction' [F (1, 19) = 2.73, P = 0.11, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.12], and no effect was found for 'group' [F (1, 19) = 0.009, P = 0.92, \u00c9\u00b3 2\u00cb 0.001].\nAnalyzing planning patterns for the initial grip selection was performed using a 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 repeated measures general linear model (GLM) with 'direction' (counterclockwise vs. clockwise), 'rotation angle' (60\u00b0 vs. 180\u00b0), and 'planning pattern' (no-planning pattern vs. effective-planning pattern vs. wrong-planning pattern) as within-subject variables and 'group' (right-HCP vs. left-HCP subjects) as the between-subjects factor. The analysis of planning patterns for the initial grip selection showed a main effect for 'planning pattern' [F (2, 38) = 16.72, P \u00cb 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.46], suggesting that the effective-planning pattern was more applicable than the two other patterns. A significant interaction was found between 'planning pattern' x 'direction' x 'group' [F (2, 38) = 11.75, P \u00cb 0.001, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.38], indicating that the left-HCP group had a significant difference between the directions in the effective-planning pattern [t (11) = - 3.35, P = 0.006] and the no-planning pattern [t (11) = 3.56, P = 0.004]. There was no significant difference between the directions in the wrong-planning pattern [t (11) = 1.36, P = 0.2]. However, the right-HCP group showed a significant difference between the directions in the effective-planning pattern [t (8) = 4.09, P = 0.003] and the wrong-planning pattern [t (8) = - 3.17, P = 0.01]. There was an interaction between 'planning pattern' x 'rotation' [F (2, 38) = 6.5, P = 0.004, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.25]. The paired t -test revealed that the difference between the two rotation angles was significant in the no-planning pattern [t (20) = 2.51, P = 0.02]. There was also a significant difference between the rotations in the effective-planning pattern [t (20) = - 2.79, P = 0.01]. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the wrong-planning pattern [t (20) = - 0.31, P = 0.76]. These results are depicted in Fig. 4D.\nEvent-related potentials (ERPs)\nIn the second experiment, ERPs were tested for statistical significance using a 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 general linear model (GLM) with 'rotation' (60\u00b0 vs. 180\u00b0), 'direction' (CCW direction vs. CW direction), and 'region' (left vs. central vs. right) as within-subject variables and 'group' (left-HCP subjects vs. right-HCP subjects) as the between-subjects factor. The ERPs for the left-HCP and right-HCP subjects while performing the motor planning task are depicted in Fig. 6A. There was a main effect for 'rotation' [F (1, 19) = 7.54, P = 0.013, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.28], indicating that an increase in the rotation angle was associated with an increase in the P2 amplitude. A significant interaction was found between 'region' x 'group' [F (2, 38) = 4.15, P = 0.023, \u00c9\u00b3 2 = 0.17]. Three independent t -tests were performed separately between the regions of interest in terms of the P2 amplitude. The difference between the two groups was not significant in the left region [t (19) = - 0.46, P = 0.64]. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the groups in the central region [t (19) = 0.2, P = 0.83]. Nonetheless, a significant difference was found between the two groups in the right region [t (19) = - 2.44, P = 0.025]. As illustrated in Fig. 6B, the right ROI of right-HCP subjects has greater P2 amplitude than the right ROI of left-HCP subjects.Fig. 6\nNeural results of the second experiment.

        "discussion": "Discussion (1)\nThe first experiment yielded three significant findings: First, left-HCP subjects were slower in planning times and chose the effective-planning pattern less frequently than the control group. Second, the P2 amplitude was smaller in left-HCP subjects than in healthy control subjects. Third, we discovered that left-HCP subjects and the right-handed control group had increased P2 amplitudes and movement-related times (e.g., planning times, grasping times, and releasing times) when planning complex actions, such as 180\u00b0 rotations.\nExperiment 2\nIn the second experiment, both left- and right-HCP subjects performed the same task with their unaffected hand as in Experiment 1 (the right-hand and the left-hand in left-HCP and right-HCP subjects, respectively). It should be noted that we used data from the first experiment on participants with left-HCP. The second experiment's primary objective was to compare the motor planning ability of left- and right-HCP subjects during the task. We specifically examined the possibility of significant differences between the two groups in terms of P2 amplitude, movement-related measures, and initial grip selection planning patterns. Additionally, the effects of task complexity were examined on both the behavioral and neural levels.\nDiscussion (2)\nThe second experiment yielded three significant findings: First, there was no evidence of a significant group effect in the movement-related measures (i.e., planning time, grasping time, and releasing time). Subjects with right and left HCP acted similarly and preferred medial direction. Second, there was a neural interaction between the ROI and the group, indicating a significant difference in the right region between the two groups. Third, there was a complexity effect at both the behavioral and neural levels, indicating that both left- and right-HCP subjects had increased P2 amplitudes and enhanced movement-related times (e.g., planning times, grasping times, and releasing times) when planning actions involving complex conditions, such as 180\u00b0 rotations.\nGeneral discussion\nThe review of the literature revealed that several studies corroborated the hypothesis of left-hemispheric dominance in motor planning and motor imagery (e.g., Schluter et al. 1998, 2001; Johnson et al. 2001; Steenbergen et al. 2004; Craj\u00e9 et al. 2009; Mutsaarts et al. 2007; Janssen et al. 2009, 2011), while several studies were contradicted this hypothesis (e.g., Kirkpatrick et al. 2013; Williams et al. 2011; Hughes et al. 2011; Dean et al. 2012; Steenbergen et al. 2007). Furthermore, neurophysiological evidence indicates that compensatory reorganization patterns following early brain damage result in individual differences among HCP patients (Carneiro et al. 2020; Ferre et al. 2020; Weinstein et al. 2018; Gupta et al. 2017; Baranello et al. 2016; Williams et al. 2011; Dobson et al. 2011; Staudt et al. 2004; Carr et al. 1993). This study aimed to determine whether motor planning was confined to one side of the brain (left side) or if both sides contributed. Therefore, we examined motor planning in left-HCP and healthy control subjects using an action selection task (Experiment 1) and left-HCP and right-HCP subjects using the same task (Experiment 2).\nThe first experiment revealed that subjects with left-HCP had slower planning times. Individuals with HCP have previously shown deficits in anticipatory action planning (Mutsaarts et al. 2005, 2006; Steenbergen et al. 2004; Craje et al. 2010). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that these patients must spend additional time preparing for sequential movements (Duff and Gordon 2003). Steenbergen et al. (2007) demonstrated that both the right and left hemiplegia groups were slower than the control group using a 'bar-handling' paradigm. The initial grip selection analysis revealed an interaction effect between the planning pattern and the group, indicating that left-HCP subjects chose less effective planning patterns than the control group. Motor planning with the unimpaired hand in HCP patients is task-dependent (Mutsaarts et al. 2006; Steenbergen et al. 2004). Mutsaarts et al. (2006) discovered that children with HCP can plan simple movements using their unimpaired hands.\nFurthermore, in line with our findings, Steenbergen et al. (2004) discovered that participants demonstrated an end-state comfort preference for the unimpaired hand, but the magnitude of this effect was different. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between the planning pattern and the rotation angle, indicating that more effective patterns were used for 180\u00b0 rotation angles. Individuals must use a goal-directed system when confronted with complex planning conditions (i.e., 180\u00b0 rotations); otherwise, they will fail to achieve end-state comfort satisfaction (Rosenbaum et al. 1990). Additionally, there was a significant interaction between planning pattern and direction, indicating that subjects used more effective grip patterns when rotating the hexagon in CCW directions, considered medial rotations for both left-HCP participants and the control group. Kirkpatrick et al. (2013) also observed that when left-HCP children were preparing to perform the motor planning task, they preferred CCW rotations in grasping the knob. The P2 amplitude of left-HCP subjects was smaller at the neural level than that of healthy control subjects. This finding is consistent with Van Elk et al. (2010a, b), who discovered that the P2 amplitude of HCP subjects was approximately half that of control subjects.\nAt the behavioral level, a significant effect for rotation was observed, consistent with the notion that is increasing task complexity (i.e., increased rotation angles) necessitates spending more time processing and executing. In the behavioral section of their study, Van Elk et al. (2010a, b) showed that an increased rotation angle was associated with increased motor-related measures. Moreover, in the present study, we found that left-HCP participants and the control group had increased P2 amplitudes for the preparation phase of actions with complex conditions (e.g., 180\u00b0 rotations). According to the complexity effect, previous research has demonstrated that the amplitude of the P2 component is modulated by the evaluation of the stimulus and the upcoming motor response (K\u00fchn et al. 2009; Potts 2004). We also found a significant main effect for the direction at the behavioral level, indicating longer planning times (or grasping times) for CW directions (lateral rotation) than CCW directions (medial rotation).\nMovements in the medial direction (i.e., when people move their hands toward the body's midline) have an advantage over movements in the lateral direction (i.e., when people move their hands away from the body's midline) because they can be planned and executed more easily and quickly (Parsons 1994, 1987). This phenomenon is called the medial-over-lateral advantage or MOLA (Funk and Brugger 2008), which has been demonstrated in mental rotation tasks (Parsons 1994, 1987; Funk and Brugger 2008) and motor planning paradigms (Kirkpatrick et al. 2013). In addition, we found an effect for the direction at the neural level, indicating larger P2 amplitudes for CW directions. There was an interaction between the direction and the rotation, showing that planning times (and grasping times) were more significant in CW directions for 180\u00b0 rotations than 60\u00b0 rotations. This finding can be explained by the notion that complex circumstances compel individuals to employ a goal-directed system and plan for future actions (Rosenbaum et al. 1990).\nThe second experiment showed no significant difference between the groups (i.e., right-HCP and left-HCP) at either behavioral or neural levels. We observed an interaction between direction and group at the behavioral level, indicating a MOLA effect in the right-HCP group, where they demonstrated faster planning (grasping) times in CW directions than CCW directions. Consistent with our findings, Kirkpatrick et al. (2013) observed no difference in movement times between two hemiplegic groups and demonstrated an interaction between direction and group, indicating a preference for movements into the body's midline, which is consistent with the MOLA. Furthermore, Williams et al. (2011) revealed that children with left and right spastic hemiplegia acted with the same response time and had similar accuracy rates on a motor imagery task. The interaction between the direction, the rotation, and the group indicated that left-HCP subjects acted faster in CCW directions, while the opposite is observed in participants with right-HCP; however, these preferences only appear for 180\u00b0 rotations. Given that the MOLA effect is a characteristic of motor planning, it can be linked to the idea that complex tasks require people to use motor planning more effectively (Van Elk et al. 2010a, b).\nAlso, there was a significant interaction between the ROI and the group, with right-HCP subjects having larger P2 amplitudes in the right ROI (F4, C4, and FC2). However, the region was largely unaffected. Furthermore, previous research utilizing source-level analysis has demonstrated that the motor planning process may originate in more central structures (Van Elk et al. 2010a, b; Kurz et al. 2014). Thus, this finding may reflect an individual response in our right-HCP group and may be related to the multiple brain reorganization patterns observed in patients with CP (Carneiro et al. 2020; Ferre et al. 2020; Weinstein et al. 2018; Gupta et al. 2017; Dobson et al. 2011; Baranello et al. 2016; Staudt et al. 2004).\nThe present study found that right-HCP and left-HCP participants had increased P2 amplitudes and enhanced movement-related times (e.g., planning times, grasping times, and releasing times) for planning actions with complex conditions, e.g., 180\u00b0 rotations compared to 60\u00b0 rotations. Previous research has shown that P2 amplitude is associated with the anticipation of an upcoming action (Nikolaev et al. 2008) and the stimulus-response coupling; hence, complex tasks elicit larger P2 amplitudes than easy tasks (Gajewski et al. 2008; Gajewski and Falkenstein 2013).\nMoreover, analyzing planning patterns for the initial grip selection indicated a significant interaction between the planning pattern, the direction, and the group. This interaction demonstrates that subjects with a right-HCP prefer more effective planning patterns in CW directions, whereas subjects with a left-HCP act oppositely. These findings corroborate those of Kirkpatrick et al. (2013), who found that participants with right-HCP preferred to grasp the knob in CW rather than CCW directions. In addition, there was another interaction between the planning pattern and the rotation, which indicated that the participants selected more effective-planning patterns for 180\u00b0 rotations, while the no-planning pattern was selected for 60\u00b0 rotations. This finding can be explained by the competition between the habitual and the goal-directed control systems. The habitual control system operates in routine and easy ways without regard for further action demands.\nOn the other hand, a goal-directed control system anticipates the entirety of the movement's action sequence prior to executing it (Rosenbaum et al. 1990; Johnson-Frey et al. 2004; St\u00f6ckel et al. 2012). For instance, individuals who face simple planning conditions (i.e., 60\u00b0 rotations) can quickly solve them and achieve end-state comfort satisfaction using the habitual control system. However, when confronted with complex planning conditions (i.e., 180\u00b0 rotations), the goal-directed system is the only one capable of achieving end-state comfort satisfaction. Therefore, individuals must use the goal-directed control system for 180\u00b0 rotations (complex planning conditions) and immediately reverse their hands. Otherwise, they will be unable to complete the task successfully or will find themselves with their hands in an awkward position.\nOverall, the findings indicate that left-HCP subjects exhibited motor planning deficits relative to the control group, which contradicts the left-hemisphere hypothesis. Moreover, we observed no difference in behavior or neural activity in experiment 2, indicating that left- and right-HCP subjects performed identically on the action selection task. The evidence does not support left-hemispheric dominance of motor planning (Kirkpatrick et al. 2013; Williams et al. 2011; Hughes et al. 2011; Dean et al. 2012; Steenbergen et al. 2007). Given that both sides of the body's motion programming are entirely dependent on one another, a distributed motor planning system across hemispheres is expected rather than a left-lateralized motor planning control system (Baraldi et al. 1999; Wang 2001; Guo et al. 2017). As previously demonstrated, hemispheric asymmetry is expected in lower-level processing, such that the contralateral hemisphere can partially segregate the execution of movements on each body side (Toga and Thompson 2003; Duboc et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2014).\nNevertheless, there is no certainty about higher-level processes such as motor planning (Hughes et al. 2011; Kirkpatrick et al. 2013). However, the rationale for the hemispheric distribution of motor planning in children born with congenital hemiplegic cerebral palsy remains unknown. Because brain damage occurs early in development in patients with HCP, compensatory reorganization patterns may result in individual differences in this population. Further research can be conducted to elucidate the hemispheric distribution of motor planning. These studies will require additional neurophysiological and clinical data and high-resolution ERP analysis (source analysis) to trace the spatial characteristics of the response that may change as a result of the pathology. Additionally, advanced imaging technologies (e.g., DTI) are required to correlate observed changes in cortical oscillations with the biomechanical deficiencies of CP patients.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusion\nThe current study's first experimental results indicate that the control group outperformed the left-HCP subjects, contradicting the left-hemisphere hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, patients with right brain damage exhibit a disproportionately negative effect on motor planning abilities. In the second experiment, we observed no significant behavioral or neural differences between left- and right-HCP subjects, inconsistent with left-hemisphere dominance for motor planning. However, motor planning distribution remains a challenge in children with congenital HCP than healthy children or those with acquired hemiplegia.\nLimitation\nOur study has some limitations that should be addressed in subsequent research. The first was the participant's absence of imaging data to confirm the location of lesions in one or both hemispheres. Only a hand dexterity test was used to assess the severity of the affected hand paralysis. Also, due to the small window of recorded planning time, time-frequency analysis of neurophysiological components was not possible.\nAcknowledgements\nTIWAN technology development Co. constructed the apparatus.

        "abstract": "Task-dependent changes in inhibition may explain why supraspinal excitability is higher during arm cycling than an intensity- and position-matched tonic contraction. The present study investigated whether interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) associated with biceps brachii activity was different during arm cycling, a locomotor output, compared to a tonic contraction. IHI was quantified using an ipsilateral silent period (iSP) evoked via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the ipsilateral motor cortex. TMS was delivered at 120% resting motor threshold during the mid-elbow flexion phase of arm cycling (6 o'clock position, made relative to a clock face) and during a position- and intensity-matched tonic contraction. In total, 36 participants took part in the study. However, only 14 participants demonstrated IHI during arm cycling and 10 participants during tonic contraction. Of these participants, eight displayed clear iSPs during arm cycling and tonic contraction. The iSP duration was longer during arm cycling than tonic contraction (p < 0.05), while iSP EMG amplitude and area were not different between tasks (p > 05 for both comparisons). The main finding from this study is that IHI appears to be stronger during arm cycling than an intensity- and position-matched tonic contraction. This does not support previous findings of higher supraspinal excitability during arm cycling.\nAuthor(s): Chris T. Compton 1 2 , Evan J. Lockyer 1 2 , Ryan J. Benson 1 , Kevin E.

        "introduction": "Introduction\nArm cycling is a bilateral, multi-joint, rhythmic motor output that resembles other forms of locomotor outputs in humans, such as walking and running, and is frequently used as a model to examine the neural control of human locomotion (for review, see Zehr et al. 2016; Power et al. 2018). The basic pattern of arm cycling is partially generated by specialized groups of interneurones within the spinal cord known as central pattern generators (CPGs) (Grillner and Wallen 1985; Dietz 2002; Zehr et al. 2004) as is the case for locomotion in non-human animals (Brown and Sherrington 1911), though descending inputs from the motor cortex is of greater importance in humans (Christensen et al. 2001; Petersen et al. 2001; Barthelemy and Nielsen 2010; Barthelemy et al. 2011). Although much work has examined corticospinal and spinal excitability during locomotor output, a few studies have assessed the excitability of cortical circuitry (Sidhu et al. 2013, 2018; Alcock et al. 2019; Benson et al. 2021).\nCortical excitability is dependent on a balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits acting within and/or between hemispheres (intra- and interhemispheric, respectively). Recent work has examined intrahemispheric circuits during locomotor output including short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in the lower (Sidhu et al. 2013) and upper (Alcock et al. 2019) body and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) (Sidhu et al. 2018) to the lower body. IHI is a logical circuit to assess given the bilateral nature of arm cycling, and that transcallosal interhemispheric connections between the primary motor cortices are proposed to play important roles in the control of unilateral and bilateral motor outputs (Ferbert et al. 1992; Carson 2005; Reis et al. 2008). However, the functional role of IHI during human motor output, in particular dynamic output, remains largely unknown (Carson 2005; Perez and Cohen 2009).",
        "methodology": "In a recent study, we provided indirect evidence that IHI may be a mechanism contributing to the modulation of cortical excitability during arm cycling (Lockyer et al. 2020). We assessed corticospinal excitability to the ipsilateral biceps brachii during contralateral arm cycling when the ipsilateral arm was actively cycling, passively cycling, or at rest. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and transmastoid electrical stimulation (TMES)-evoked cervicomedullary motor-evoked potentials (CMEPs) were both highest when the ipsilateral arm was at rest. This led us to conclude that lower supraspinal excitability during bilateral arm cycling was possibly due to IHI between the active hemispheres, an effect that was reduced when the ipsilateral arm was not actively cycling. We subsequently assessed IHI using a TMS single pulse induced ipsilateral silent period (iSP) as opposed to the more commonly used paired-pulse TMS method. The iSP measures inhibition of volitional motor activity (TMS-induced decrease in ongoing electromyography amplitude, i.e., EMG) rather than a reduction in MEP amplitude. We showed that IHI was present to the biceps brachii during arm cycling (Benson et al. 2021), though we were unable to say with certainty whether the degree of IHI was specific to arm cycling (i.e., task-dependent), because we did not compare to a tonic contraction (Lockyer et al. 2021). Determining whether the amount of IHI is task-dependent is of importance and could shed light on our previous finding of higher supraspinal excitability during arm cycling compared to an intensity-matched tonic contraction (Forman et al. 2014).\nThe purpose of the present study was to determine whether the amount of IHI was different between arm cycling and an intensity- and position-matched tonic contraction. IHI was quantified during the aforementioned motor tasks using a single pulse paradigm as we have previously reported (Benson et al. 2021). Briefly, a single suprathreshold TMS pulse activates excitatory transcallosal axons that synapse onto inhibitory interneurones in the contralateral motor cortex, thus producing a brief suppression of descending excitation within the corticospinal pathway. This effect is visible as a suppression of the ongoing muscle activity as assessed via surface electromyography (EMG) referred to as the ipsilateral silent period (iSP) (Ferbert et al. 1992; Perez et al. 2014). The depth, area and duration of the iSP provide measures of IHI, also referred to as transcallosal inhibition (Perez et al. 2014). We hypothesized that IHI would be lower during arm cycling than a tonic contraction.\nMethods\nEthical approval\nPrior to data collection, all participants received verbal explanation of the experimental protocol. Once all questions were answered, written informed consent was obtained. This study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and all protocols were approved by the Interdisciplinary Committee on Ethics in Human Research at Memorial University of Newfoundland (ICEHR no. 20190339-HK). Additionally, the protocols were carried out in accordance with the Tri-Council Guidelines in Canada, with the potential risks being fully disclosed to all participants.\nParticipants\nA total of 36 participants were recruited from the university population to participate in this study. Of the 36, 14 demonstrated IHI during arm cycling, while 10 demonstrated IHI during an intensity-matched tonic contraction. A total of 8 participants demonstrated IHI in both the cycling and tonic contraction conditions. A subset of these data has been published previously regarding the cycling information (Benson et al. 2021). However, due to the difficulty in eliciting IHI in both cycling and tonic tasks, we were unable appropriately compare tonic and cycling tasks in the Benson et al. (2020) study. As such, we collected data on additional participants for each group for the present work.\nA total of eight male participants (height 177.6 \u00b1 5.89 cm; weight 78.6 \u00b1 8.84 kg; age 22.2 \u00b1 2.3 years) with no known neurological disorders were used to compare IHI between tasks. All participants completed a safety checklist to screen for any possible risks to magnetic simulation (Rossini et al. 2015), and a Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire to screen for any contraindications to physical activity (Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology, 2002). Hand dominance was determined using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Veale 2014). This was done to ensure that investigations of IHI were done with respect to the non-dominant arm, as interhemispheric inhibitory connections are strongest from the non-dominant to the dominant hemisphere (Netz et al. 1995; Chen et al. 2003; B\u00e4umer et al. 2007). All participants were familiarized with the stimulations and arm cycling prior to data collection.\nStudy design\nAll arm cycling trials were performed using an arm cycle ergometer (SCIFIT ergometer, model PRO2 Total Body, Tulsa, OK, USA) with participants cycling with a neutral forearm position. The arm cranks were locked 180 \u00ba out of phase to establish an asynchronous cycling pattern (Fig. 1A). To ensure participant comfort, participants were seated in an upright position at a comfortable distance from the hand cranks to ensure that there was no flexion or rotation of the torso during cycling, and the seat height was adjusted, so that participants' shoulders were level with the axis of rotation of the arm cranks. Participants were asked to wear wrist braces to minimize the amount of wrist flexion and extension during cycling, as to limit the influence of heteronymous reflex connections that exist between the wrist flexors and the biceps brachii (Manning and Bawa 2011). TMS was delivered to the dominant motor cortex when the non-dominant arm passed the 6 o'clock position during mid-elbow flexion where the non-dominant biceps brachii are most active (Chaytor et al. 2020). Similar to previous arm cycling studies, 6 o'clock was specified as the \"bottom dead centre\" of the cycling pattern (Balter and Zehr 2007; Forman et al. 2014, 2015; Copithorne et al. 2015; Lockyer et al. 2018). All participants cycled at 60 revolutions per minute (RPM) and 25 watts for a total of 150 s, over which they received 30 TMS stimulations interspersed by 5 s.Fig. 1\nOverhead view of the experimental setup during both arm cycling (A ) and tonic contraction (C ) trials for a right-hand dominant individual. Curved arrows indicate the direction of the intended movement. A chain was used to lock the arm cranks in place for the tonic contraction trial. EMG electrodes are located over the biceps brachii of both arms. Rectified EMG traces recorded from the non-dominant biceps brachii muscle are displayed from a representative subject during arm cycling (B ) and an intensity-matched tonic contraction (D ). The arrow represents the magnetic stimulation artifact. The regions between the sets of dashed vertical lines represent the regions of EMG that were compared. In both figures, the inset depicts the iSP (abscissas) following TMS. In the inset in B , the black trace represents stimulated EMG compared to the control EMG (gray trace) taken exactly 1 s later from the subsequent, non-stimulated EMG burst. In D , the inset depicts the iSP during tonic contraction. The gray rectangle portrays the post-inhibitory rebound of EMG that is present following the iSP during arm cycling (B ) but not tonic contraction (D )\nTo match the tonic and cycling trials, the average background EMG (bEMG) of the biceps brachii 50 ms before stimulation from the cycling trial was assessed. The average value of the rectified bEMG served as an indication of contraction intensity which has been done previously (Forman et al. 2014, 2015). Following the cycling task, the average of the rectified bEMG was then displayed on a computer screen via a horizontal line. The arm cranks were locked with the non-dominant arm at the 6 o'clock position, and participants were then required to produce a tonic contraction whereby the EMG produced in the biceps brachii was equal to the horizontal line displayed on the screen (Forman et al. 2014). The participant accomplished this by placing both hands on the arm cranks and pulling with the non-dominant arm (Fig. 1C). The participant was able to see the ongoing muscle activity of the non-dominant biceps brachii and was instructed to contract at an intensity in which the ongoing EMG matched the pre-placed horizontal line representing cycling bEMG. The dominant arm was placed at the 12 o'clock position, with the hand holding onto the handle as it would during arm cycling. This method of matching EMG activity between tasks has shown success in previous works (Pyndt et al. 2003; Carroll et al. 2006; Forman et al. 2014). TMS was delivered to the dominant motor cortex, while the non-dominant biceps brachii was producing a contraction of the same intensity observed during arm cycling; thus, any differences in IHI could theoretically be attributed to the task. The number of stimulations was the same as that during cycling (see Experimental Protocol).\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation\nTMS to the motor cortex was applied using a Magstim 200 stimulator (Magstim, Whitland, Dyfed, UK). During both experimental conditions, a figure-eight coil (external loop diameters of 9 cm) was placed 2 cm lateral to vertex with the handle pointing posterolaterally at 45 degrees to the midline of the head. To isolate the biceps brachii representation of the motor cortex, the stimulator was turned to a suprathreshold intensity (~ 75% maximal stimulator output, i.e., MSO) and moved around the head until the largest MEP could be evoked with the dominant arm biceps brachii at rest. This location was defined as the 'hot spot' and was marked with a marker. To ensure an accurate marking of the hot spot, all participants wore a white swim cap to allow the researchers to trace around the TMS coil. To find the resting motor threshold (RMT), participants were instructed to rest with both hands on the handles of the cycle ergometer with the dominant hand at the 6 o'clock position. RMT was found by decreasing the stimulation intensity to the minimum value in which an MEP of ~ 50 [mu]V in peak-to-peak amplitude could be evoked in the dominant biceps in 4 of 8 trials via stimulation of the hot spot (Rothwell et al. 1999). Stimulation intensity was then increased to 120% RMT, as this intensity has been shown to display a clear iSP without evoking a short-latency facilitation (Perez et al. 2014) and was successfully used during arm cycling in our prior work (Benson et al. 2021). TMS stimulation intensity remained constant for the remainder of the experimental protocol using an anterior-posterior directed current.\nElectromyography\nEMG recordings were taken from the biceps brachii of both arms using pairs of Ag-AgCl surface electrodes (KendallTM 130 Foam Electrodes with conductive adhesive hydrogel, Covidien IIC, Massachusetts, USA). Electrodes were placed 2 cm apart (centre to centre) over the midline of the muscle belly, in a parallel fashion with respect to the target muscle fibres. A ground electrode was placed on the lateral epicondyle of the right limb. Prior to electrode placement, the skin was thoroughly prepared by removal of dead epithelial cells (using abrasive paper) followed by sanitization with an isopropyl alcohol swab. EMG was collected on-line and analog-to-digitally converted at a rate of 5 kHz using CED 1401 interface and the associated Signal 5 (Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd., Cambridge, UK) software. All signals were amplified (x 300) and filtered using a 3-Pole Butterworth filter with cut-off frequencies of 10-1000 Hz. Collected data were stored on a password protected PC for further analysis.\nExperimental protocol\nFollowing the determination of required TMS intensity, participants completed 2 trials (1 arm cycling and 1 tonic contraction trial). During arm cycling, TMS was delivered to the dominant motor cortex when the non-dominant arm passed the 6 o'clock position, as to elicit an iSP in the non-dominant biceps brachii during mid-elbow flexion. During tonic contraction, TMS was delivered to the dominant motor cortex, while the non-dominant biceps brachii produced a tonic contraction of matched intensity to that of arm cycling. Since tonic contraction intensity was matched to the EMG observed during the arm cycling conditions, it was necessary to perform the arm cycling condition first (Lockyer et al. 2021). During both conditions, participants received a total of 30 TMS pulses. In the scenario where an ipsilateral MEP was evident, the trial was removed, and the remaining trials were analyzed.\nData analysis\nIpsilateral silent period\nDuring arm cycling trials, the iSP was measured in the biceps brachii of the non-dominant arm during elbow flexion when the biceps brachii is active (Forman et al. 2014, 2015; Spence et al. 2016; Lockyer et al. 2018). To obtain the average iSP, all 30 EMG traces from the cycling trials were averaged and a single iSP measurement taken and was used to compare between tasks. Stimulations were triggered at the 6 o'clock position of arm cycling (mid-elbow flexion or bottom dead centre). An average iSP was measured from 30 cycling trials. Given the differences between the tonic and cycling protocols, different methods to assess iSP were necessary for each condition. For tonic trials, the onset of the iSP was determined offline via visual examination of the EMG trace following the stimulus artifact and was defined as the time point when the rectified EMG fell below the bEMG for a minimum of 10 ms. The bEMG was defined as the mean of the rectified EMG channel over a 50 ms window immediately prior to the stimulation artifact. The end of the iSP occurred when the rectified EMG returned to the bEMG average. The duration of the iSP was the time-interval between the onset and end of the iSP. For cycling trials, because muscle activity follows a sinusoidal type of pattern of activation and inactivation (Chaytor et al. 2020), an alternative measure was required. As such, iSP was determined offline via visual examination of the EMG trace following the stimulus artifact and was defined as the time point when the rectified EMG fell below the bEMG for a minimum of 10 ms. However, for appropriate assessment of IHI, the control iSP EMG was time- and position-matched and taken from the subsequent cycling revolution where no stimulation occurred (i.e., control EMG, see Fig. 1B). Control EMG was calculated 1 s after the iSP and for the same duration as the iSP (i.e., in the subsequent EMG burst during arm cycling). This ensured that control EMG was calculated during the same cycling phase and for the same duration as the iSP, given a 60 RPM cadence.\nThe depth of the iSP was calculated from the average rectified EMG during the entirety of the iSP and expressed as the percentage of reduction from the average bEMG or control EMG [iSP depth = 100 - (mean rectified iSP EMG/mean rectified bEMG or control EMG) * 100]. Finally, the area of the iSP was calculated using the following formula [tonic: iSP area = (mean rectified pre-stimulus EMG) * (iSP duration) - (au_iSP); cycling: iSP area = (au_control EMG - au_iSP)], where au_iSP is the area under the rectified EMG during the iSP and au_control EMG is area under the rectified EMG during the control EMG (Perez et al. 2014). Finally, assessments in EMG were completed following the iSP. A 50 ms duration of the rectified EMG following the iSP and control EMG were assessed and compared within and between tasks to better understand what is occurring following the inhibition. Any trials in which short-latency facilitation was observed were removed from data analysis, as this could mask any potential inhibitory effects (Perez et al. 2014).\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistics were performed in SPSS (SPSS 20 for Macintosh, IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA). All data were normally distributed (p > 0.05; Shapiro-Wilk tests). Assumptions of sphericity were tested using Mauchley's test. If violated, the degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity. Paired-samples two-tailed t tests were used to assess any differences in bEMG, iSP depth, iSP duration, iSP onset, and iSP area. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and the alpha level was set at p < 0.05.\nMethodological considerations\nSeveral methodological considerations must be taken into account in the interpretation of the present results (Lockyer et al. 2021). First, it is unlikely, but possible, that subcortical pathways contributed to the observed task-dependent difference in IHI given that we did not assess spinal excitability. However, others have previously reported no spinal contribution (Perez et al. 2014). Second, the time delay between the conditioning of the motor cortex with a TMS pulse means that although the motor cortex would have been conditioned at mid-elbow flexion, corresponding with our prior work, the iSP measurements were examined during the inactivation phase of the biceps brachii as the EMG levels return to baseline (Fig. 1). Previous work showed that SICI to the knee extensors was absent during tonic contractions and the activation phase of leg cycling but present during the inactivation phase. Thus, potential phase-dependent differences in IHI within the cycling task may be at play with IHI stronger during the inactivation phase of the biceps brachii. Regardless, the presence of IHI during the inactivation phase allowed a comparison to a tonic contraction. Third, it was also necessary to obtain a control EMG value for the cycling condition from a subsequent burst of EMG. This may have resulted in slightly different EMG values given the inherent variability of the EMG burst during dynamic motor output. We are confident, however, that the timing of the EMG burst, and the phase of the cycle was likely not different based on prior work (Lockyer et al. 2019). We have previously shown that participants required to cycle at a set cadence were within 1.5 RPM of said cadence (Lockyer et al. 2019). This 1.5 RPM difference represents only ~ 4 ms per revolution, indicating that differences in cadence, though not recorded, were unlikely to affect the phase-dependent measures of IHI. Note that at a cadence of 60 RPM, the time difference between each phase as determined by the hour position on a clock represents 83.3 ms.\nIn addition to these considerations, it is worth noting that difficulties eliciting IHI have been previously reported (Perez et al. 2014), where only 50% of the subjects demonstrated IHI. The reason for this technical difficulty is currently unknown. This percentage is further reduced when attempting to assess IHI in different muscles (Perez et al. 2014) or in different tasks, as evident in this current study. Fourth, though a task-dependent difference in bEMG was observed, the finding was not significant and may be due to a type II error given the low sample size. This is important to consider given that bEMG may influence the silent period. Finally, we did not record EMG from the antagonist muscle group, thus limiting our ability to comment on co-contraction and possible neural implications nor did we use a neuronavigation system.\nLockyer, EJ, Compton, CT, Forman, DA, Pearcey, GE, Button, DC, Power, KE: Moving forward: methodological considerations for assessing corticospinal excitability during rhythmic motor output in humans. vol. 126, pp. 181-194.

        "results": "Results\nA total of 36 participants were tested; however, we were unable to identify a clear iSP in either condition for 20 participants. Thus, these data were excluded from the analyses. Of the remaining 16 participants, 14 participants exhibited a clear iSP during arm cycling, while 10 participants exhibited discernable iSPs during tonic contractions.\nArm cycling and tonic contraction trials\nIn the arm cycling trials (n = 14), the averaged MSOs used to elicit RMT and the iSP were 54.6 \u00b1 8.74% and 65.6 \u00b1 10.5%, respectively. In the tonic contraction trials (n = 10), the averaged MSOs used to elicit RMT and the iSP were 52.9 \u00b1 9.16% and 63.5 \u00b1 11.0%, respectively.\nIn total, eight participants demonstrated clearly discernable iSPs during both tasks. Data for these participants were compared. Figure 1 shows an example of the iSPs in the non-dominant biceps brachii from one participant who showed an iSP during both arm cycling (B ) and tonic contraction (D ).\nArm cycling vs. tonic contraction\nEight of the participants tested in the study displayed a visible iSP in both arm cycling and tonic contraction. Importantly, to accurately compare iSPs between the two tasks, matching for muscle activity prior to stimulation was necessary (Lockyer et al. 2021). This was achieved as there were no significant differences between the two tasks for bEMG when taken at the 6 o'clock position (142 \u00b1 47.0 [micro]V and 123 \u00b1 44.0 [micro]V for arm cycling and tonic contraction, respectively, p = 0.12) (see Fig. 2A). However, there were notable differences in IHI parameters between the two tasks. Specifically, iSP duration was longer during arm cycling compared to tonic contraction (49.1 \u00b1 14.2 ms vs 33.6 \u00b1 10.7 ms, respectively, p < 0.05; Cohen's D = 1.3; see Fig. 2B).Fig. 2\nGroup data for bEMG (A ), iSP duration (B ), and iSP EMG (C ) during arm cycling (dark gray boxes) and tonic contraction (light gray boxes).

We then compared the EMG using a 50 ms post-iSP window to the position-matched 50 ms post-control EMG. The EMG burst post-iSP was significantly larger (156 \u00b1 81 [micro]V vs 113 \u00b1 58.0 [micro]V, p < 0.05; Cohen's D = 0.6). While EMG 50 ms post-iSP in the tonic condition does increase following iSP, it is not significantly different from the bEMG (133 \u00b1 45.0 [micro]V vs 123 \u00b1 44.0 [micro]V, respectively) (Table 1). When comparing the differences in the compensatory rebound EMG to a control measure (i.e., background EMG for tonic and control burst for cycling), there is a significant difference between cycling and tonic tasks (cycling difference: 43 \u00b1 38.0 [micro]V; tonic difference: 10 \u00b1 19.0 [micro]V, p < 0.01; see Fig. 1B and D).

        "discussion": "Discussion\nIn this study, we compared IHI during arm cycling to an intensity- and position-matched tonic contraction. Contrary to our hypothesis, IHI during arm cycling demonstrated greater IHI as indicated by a longer iSP duration, though there were not task-dependent differences in the iSP amplitudes or areas. An unexpected and secondary finding was that a post-iSP rebound effect in the EMG (i.e., post-inhibitory rebound) during arm cycling is present that was not evident during tonic contraction.\nThere is now a growing body of literature confirming the differences in corticospinal excitability between rhythmic and tonic contractions (Kalmar 2018; Power et al. 2018; Lockyer et al. 2021). Recent work from our lab showed that supraspinal excitability to the biceps brachii was higher during arm cycling than an intensity- and position-matched tonic contraction when assessed during elbow flexion (Forman et al. 2014). In attempt to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for this finding, we subsequently assessed SICI to the biceps brachii but showed that amount of SICI was not task-dependent (Alcock et al. 2019). Thus, we decided to look at another inhibitory circuit present during motor output, IHI. The major difference between the two inhibitory circuits is SICI represents intracortical inhibition, while IHI represents inhibition between the two cortices (Daskalakis et al. 2002).\nIHI is important to consider as we know bilateral connections between motor cortices play a role in modulating motor output. For example, Ames et al. (2019) found bilateral motor cortex activation during both unilateral and bilateral arm cycling in the monkey (Ames and Churchland 2019). Bilateral cortical activation is suspected to be, in part, a result of interhemispheric connections between motor cortices. In humans, Lockyer et al. (2020) assessed MEPs from the biceps brachii during bilateral and unilateral arm cycling. Contrary to their expectations, MEPs assessed from the biceps brachii were lower during bilateral arm cycling versus unilateral arm cycling. They suggested that IHI may be responsible for the lower corticospinal excitability during bilateral arm cycling to reduce unwanted biceps muscle activity during the elbow extension phase. If IHI increased to reduce unwanted biceps brachii activity as the elbow extended during arm cycling, it is reasonable to speculate that IHI could decrease to allow for muscle facilitation (i.e., disinhibition) of the biceps brachii during elbow flexion as the contralateral limb engaged in elbow extension. Recently, Benson et al. (2020) established that IHI was evident during arm cycling, but it was not determined whether the degree of IHI observed was specific to arm cycling, a locomotor task (i.e., task-dependency was not assessed).\nIn the present study, although depth of the IHI from the biceps brachii did not differ between tasks, the duration of IHI was longer in arm cycling when compared to an intensity- and position-matched tonic contraction. This seemingly contradicts our hypothesis, in which we had expected to see lower IHI during arm cycling compared to a tonic contraction. While multiple inhibitory circuits such as SICI (Sidhu et al. 2013; Alcock et al. 2019) and LICI (Sidhu et al. 2018) are evident during locomotor-like tasks, IHI was of particular interest. Perez et al. (2014) demonstrated a reduced iSP during flexion of the biceps brachii on one side, and extension on the other (flexion-extension) compared to unilateral contraction (flexion-rest) and bilateral flexion of the biceps brachii (flexion-flexion). The flexion-extension contraction described by Perez and colleagues is quite similar to the activity of the biceps and triceps brachii during the asynchronous arm cycling task in the present study, albeit they used tonic contractions. Findings from the present study may align with other findings which found a larger iSP during fast ballistic contractions compared to slower, self-paced elbow flexion contractions (Tazoe and Perez 2013). Thus, perhaps during arm cycling the phase changes (i.e., flexion and extension about the elbow) and speed of the contraction relative to that of an isometric contraction could be underlying the observed increase in iSP. It is interesting to speculate on the potential physiological differences in the measurements assessed. As discussed in our recent work (Benson et al. 2020), the depth and duration of the iSP may represent different cortical mechanisms. The iSP depth may be influenced by the number of inhibitory synaptic inputs projecting to the contralateral motor cortex within a short time frame. The iSP duration, however, may represent a greater temporal dispersion of inhibitory synaptic inputs to the contralateral motor cortex.\nWhile there were apparent differences in IHI between the two tasks, there were some similarities. Consistent with previous literature from Perez et al. (2014), iSP onset was approximately 30 ms for both tasks, indicating that the interhemispheric signal transmission time was not task-dependent. The amplitude of iSP EMG and iSP depth were also similar between the two tasks, which explains why area was not significantly different between the two tasks, even though duration was longer in cycling. The primary task-dependent difference was that the duration of the iSP was 146% longer (i.e., 16 ms) in arm cycling compared to a position- and intensity-matched tonic contraction. Differences in duration but not amplitude or area raises an important question as to which measurement most accurately reflects IHI. Unfortunately, the answer to this question is currently not known (Hupfeld et al. 2020). We briefly discussed this issue in our recent work (Benson et al. 2021) and suggested, as have others (Hupfeld et al. 2020), that each measure may be influenced by different cortical mechanisms as discussed above.\nThe second finding, which was unexpected, was the post-inhibitory rebound within the EMG burst during arm cycling that was not present during tonic contractions (Fig. 1). The duration of the EMG burst during elbow flexion from which the iSP was assessed was not longer than the subsequent EMG burst from which the control EMG was taken. This means that towards the end of the cycling revolution when EMG is expected to reduce, EMG during the iSP revolution increased. Whether this post-inhibitory rebound has physiological relevance during arm cycling is unknown though post-inhibitory rebound in spinal motoneurones has been demonstrated during fictive locomotor output using a reduced preparation (Bertrand and Cazalets 1998). In the present study, the brief interruption of excitatory descending input shifts the balance of excitation and inhibition to the spinal motoneurones to inhibition as shown via the iSP. Following the iSP, the motoneurones could then demonstrate a post-inhibitory rebound effect. The same may not occur during tonic contraction due to potential task-dependent differences in spinal motoneurone properties previously demonstrated in the adult cat (Power et al. 2010), specifically differences in voltage-dependent excitation. This putative mechanism is theoretical and will require further investigation to determine whether it is accurate.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusion\nFor the first time, we have successfully compared IHI during arm cycling to an intensity- and position-matched contraction. During arm cycling, iSP duration is longer and the post-iSP EMG responses were greater than an intensity- and position-matched tonic activity. The present study has demonstrated IHI during a locomotor activity thus adding novel information to the growing body of literature regarding cortical excitability during locomotor output. Unfortunately, we are unable to comment on the cortical circuit(s) that lead to higher supraspinal excitability during arm cycling compared to a tonic contraction (Forman et al. 2014). Future studies should explore the phase-dependent modulation of the iSP.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by a grant to KEP from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

        "abstract": "The appropriate selection of passive and active defensive behaviors in threatening situations is essential for survival. Previous studies have shown that passive defensive responses depend on activity of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), whereas active ones primarily rely on the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the mechanisms underlying flexible switching between these two types of responses remain unknown. Here we show in mice that the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) mediates the selection of defensive behaviors through its interaction with the CeA and the NAc. We show that the PVT-CeA pathway drives conditioned freezing responses, whereas the PVT-NAc pathway is inhibited during freezing and, instead, signals active avoidance events. Optogenetic manipulations revealed that activity in the PVT-CeA or PVT-NAc pathway biases behavior toward the selection of passive or active defensive responses, respectively. These findings provide evidence that the PVT mediates flexible switching between opposing defensive behaviors.\nMa et al. show that the PVT biases the selection of passive and active defensive behaviors via mostly segregated projections to the CeA and the NAc. Their results update current views on the role of the midline thalamus in fear-related behaviors.\nAuthor(s): Jun Ma 1 , Johann du Hoffmann 2 3 , Morgan Kindel 1 , B.

In contrast, the mechanisms controlling instrumental defensive responses, such as active avoidance and those that guide the selection of passive and active defensive behaviors, are far less studied5-8 . This is surprising considering that, in nature, animals readily engage and switch between both types of defensive strategies depending on threat imminence8-10 .\nAlthough studies on the neurobiology of defensive behaviors have pointed to the contributions of both cortical and subcortical networks to the expression of specific defensive behaviors8,10 , it is generally recognized that Pavlovian reactions, such as freezing and conditioned flight, are driven by genetically defined neuronal subpopulations of the CeA4,11,12 and that active defensive behaviors largely depend on the NAc13-15 . Interestingly, reports from the last decade suggest that these two regions of the brain likely compete for the control of defensive behaviors13,16 . Specifically, these studies demonstrated that, although lesions and pharmacological manipulations of the CeA attenuate freezing and promote active avoidance behavior16,17 , inactivation of the NAc decreases avoidance but enhances freezing13,14 . Despite these seminal observations, the mechanisms dictating the balance of the competition between these two regions and behavioral outcomes remain unknown.\nA potential candidate for mediating the selection of these two types of defensive behaviors is the basolateral amygdala (BLA), because it sends projections to both the NAc and the CeA18 . Indeed, BLA projections to the CeA are known to mediate conditioned freezing responses19 , whereas BLA projections to the NAc have been shown to support active avoidance behavior14 . However, the necessity of the BLA for the expression of conditioned freezing and avoidance behaviors decreases with the passage of time20-22 , suggesting that other brain regions likely contribute to arbitrating between these two defensive strategies. We predicted that the posterior portion of the PVT (pPVT) could be implicated in this process, considering its strong innervation of the CeA and the NAc23,24 as well as its documented role in mediating conditioned freezing responses, particularly at remote time points12,22 . Consistent with this prediction, here we show that the pPVT drives active avoidance through its projections to the NAc. Moreover, we demonstrate that divergent projections from the pPVT to the NAc and CeA mediate the selection of active avoidance and freezing behavior, respectively. These findings highlight the existence of a previously unrecognized switch for the selection of passive and active defensive behaviors in the midline thalamus.",
        "introduction": "",
        "methodology": "The pPVT is a stress-sensitive region of the thalamus that sends robust, largely non-overlapping projections to the CeA and the NAc (Fig. 1a-d)25 . Unlike primates and carnivores, the rodent thalamus is largely devoid of GABAergic neurons26 . Thus, projection neurons of the PVT are predominantly glutamatergic27 . Although activation of CeA-projecting pPVT neurons is thought to be necessary for the retrieval of conditioned fear memory and its accompanying of freezing behavior12,22 , the NAc is the main target of most pPVT neurons (Fig. 1e-j)25 . Surprisingly, the contribution of pPVT-NAc neurons to fear-related behaviors is currently unknown. To investigate this, we first monitored the activity of dopamine D2 receptor expressing neurons of the pPVT (pPVTD2R )--a marker of stress-sensitive PVT neurons, most of which project to the NAc (Fig. 1g-j)28-30 --during fear conditioning (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). Toward this goal, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6s in pPVTD2R neurons of Drd2 -Cre mice (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Next, after a habituation session (Day 0), on Day 1 mice were fear conditioned to an auditory cue (conditioned stimulus (CS)) that co-terminated with a footshock (unconditioned stimulus (US)), and on Day 2 a fear memory retrieval test was performed (Extended Data Fig. 1b-e). On both days, bulk changes in GCaMP6s fluorescence in pPVTD2R neurons were monitored using fiber photometry. We reasoned that, because most pPVTD2R neurons project to the NAc, bulk GCaMP6s fluorescence gathered from this neuronal population with fiber photometry would likely be dominated by the activity of PVT-NAc neurons. Consistent with previous reports, pPVTD2R neurons were readily activated by the US during the conditioning session on Day 1 (refs. 28,29 ) (Extended Data Fig. 1g,j,n,o). Notably, we also observed the emergence of small but consistent CS-evoked GCaMP6s responses in late conditioning trials, suggesting that the activity of these neurons is modulated by learning22 (Extended Data Fig. 1l,m). On Day 2, fear memory retrieval was associated with an average decrease in GCaMP6s fluorescence upon CS presentation (Extended Data Fig. 1h,k). These inhibitory GCaMP6s responses were variable and apparent in many, but not all, CS presentations (Extended Data Fig. 2a), suggesting that they could be tied to behavior. To explore this possibility, we classified all retrieval trials into three groups based on the percentage of freezing displayed and quantified the average CS-evoked response for each trial category (Extended Data Fig. 2a-d and Methods). As predicted, the average change in GCaMP6s fluorescence for each trial category varied as a function of freezing behavior, with the highest freezing scores being associated with the most robust inhibitory responses (Extended Data Fig. 2a-g). Notably, we did not observe any effect of retrieval trial number on the GCaMP6s signal (Extended Data Fig. 2h-j). These results indicate the existence of an inverse relationship between freezing behavior and pPVTD2R neuron activity. Consistent with this, pairwise comparisons of CS-evoked movement and GCaMP6s fluorescence uncovered a modest but positive correlation between these two parameters (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Notably, no such correlation was observed on imaging data gathered during habituation, before fear conditioning (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). As such, our collective results demonstrate that conditioned freezing is associated with decreased activity among pPVTD2R neurons.\nFig. 1\npPVTD2R projections to NAc and CeA are partially segregated.\na , Schematic of the viral vector strategy for anterograde tracing pPVT projections. b , Representative images showing Halo-mCherry expression in neurons of the pPVT (left) and axon terminals within the NAc (middle) and the CeA (right). c , Schematic of the viral vector strategy for anterograde tracing pPVTD2R projections. d , Representative images showing ChR2-YFP expression in pPVTD2R neurons (left) and axon terminals within the NAc (middle) and the CeA (right). e , Schematic of the retrograde tracing strategy used for labeling CeA- and NAc-projecting pPVT neurons. f , Representative images showing the targets for dual-color CTB injections, green into the NAc (left) and red into the CeA (right). g , Representative images showing that the retrograde labeled NAc-projecting cells (green) and CeA-projecting cells (red) are predominantly present in the D2R-labeled (gray) pPVT region. h , Quantification of the density of CeA- and NAc-projecting neurons in the pPVT.

To formally assess this possibility, after expressing GCaMP6s in pPVTD2R neurons of Drd2 -Cre mice (Fig. 2a), we trained mice in a two-way signaled active avoidance (2AA) task where performing a specific action--moving to the neighboring compartment of a shuttle box--upon presentation of the CS, enables mice to avoid a footshock (US) (Fig. 2b). Mice that are well-trained on this task typically forgo passive (freezing) responses to CS presentation in favor of active (avoidance) responses (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3)6 . Nevertheless, on a trial-by-trial basis, they do engage in both freezing and avoidance behavior upon CS presentation (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). As such, this task provides an opportunity for assessing neuronal activity while animals transition between passive and instrumental fear-related behavioral responses within single test sessions. Consistent with previous reports, mice displayed prominent freezing behavior to the CS in early sessions of the 2AA task6 (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3a). However, additional training led to progressive decreases in CS-evoked freezing and a concomitant increase in active avoidance responses (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3a). After three sessions of 2AA training (Days 1-3), pPVTD2R neurons were imaged using fiber photometry during two additional training sessions (Days 4 and 5) (Fig. 2c). Imaging trials were subsequently divided into two behaviorally relevant categories: trials in which mice avoided the US (avoidance) and trials in which they failed to do so (failure). Notably, during failure trials, mice reliably shuttled to the adjacent compartment in response to the US (Supplementary Video 1). The data for avoidance and failure trials are summarized in Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3 (Fig. 2d-h and Extended Data Fig. 3b-d). Classifying trials in this manner revealed important differences in the activity of pPVTD2R neurons during avoidance and failure trials (Supplementary Video 1). First, CS presentation elicited robust increases in GCaMP6s fluorescence in pPVTD2R neurons during avoidance trials, whereas, in failure trials, it mostly induced strong decreases in the activity of these neurons (Fig. 2g). In addition, presentation of the US during failure trials was associated with robust activation of pPVTD2R neurons, consistent with our fear conditioning data as well as with previous reports (Fig. 2d,e)28,29 . Interestingly, whereas mice engaged in instrumental responses during avoidance trials (by definition), they spent significantly more time freezing in response to the CS during failure trials compared to avoidance trials (Fig. 2f). This suggests that the differential dynamics of calcium signals of pPVTD2R neurons observed across these trial categories could be related to behavior. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed calcium transients time-locked to discrete task and behavioral events, such as CS onset, maximum velocity and freezing behavior (Fig. 2h). These analyses revealed that, although CS onset, maximum velocity and escape behavior (shuttling in response to the CS or US onset) were all associated with increases in GCaMP6s fluorescence, freezing behavior was accompanied by attenuated pPVTD2R neuronal activity for both avoidance and failure trials (Fig. 2h). Thus, although mean signal variations more accurately distinguish avoidance and failure trials (Fig. 2f,g), discrete fluctuations in calcium transients largely reflect moment-to-moment variation in behavior rather than trial type (Fig. 2h). It is interesting that rises in neuronal activity were correlated with maximum velocity particularly for avoidance trials (Fig. 2h). This result indicates a potential relationship between pPVTD2R neuron activity and vigor, such as that necessary to avoid or escape an impending threat. Collectively, our findings support the idea that, at the population level, pPVTD2R neurons signal instrumental defensive behaviors and are suppressed during freezing.\nFig. 2\npPVTD2R neurons control active avoidance and are inhibited during freezing.\na , Representative image of GCaMP6s expression and fiber placements (n = 5 mice). b , Schematic of the 2AA task. c , Behavior performance during 2AA. d , Representative imaging traces for avoidance and failure trials. e , Top, heat maps of calcium responses.

All data in the figure are shown as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m.\nSource data\nTo investigate whether activation of pPVTD2R neurons is required for active avoidance, we expressed in these neurons the inhibitory opsin eNpHR3.0 (Halorhodopsin (Halo)) and trained mice in the 2AA task as described above (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 4a-j). After 2AA training, mice were subjected to three test sessions: Test Days 1-3 (Fig. 2j-l). On Test Day 1 (light off), both control and Halo-expressing mice displayed robust avoidance behavior (Fig. 2j,k). On Test Day 2 (light on), light stimulation during CS presentations significantly attenuated the avoidance rate of Halo-expressing but not control mice (Fig. 2j,k). This effect was accompanied by a significant increase in the latency to avoid and an increase in CS-evoked freezing behavior (Fig. 2k,l). These parameters partially recovered on Test Day 3 (light off) (Fig. 2j-l). Notably, restricting optogenetic inhibition of pPVTD2R neurons to the inter-trial interval (ITI) did not significantly alter behavior (Extended Data Fig. 4k-t). Similarly, we did not observe any light stimulation-induced effect on locomotion in an open field arena (Extended Data Fig. 4j). In summary, these findings show that, at the population level, pPVTD2R neurons are required for active avoidance behavior and are inhibited during freezing.\npPVT-NAc projections drive avoidance and antagonize freezing\nAlthough most pPVTD2R neurons project to the NAc (Fig. 1)29 , it is unclear whether pPVTD2R -NAc projections are modulated by passive and/or active responding in the 2AA task. To address this question, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP7s in pPVTD2R neurons and implanted an optical fiber unilaterally in the NAc to measure the activity of pPVTD2R -NAc projections using fiber photometry (Fig. 3a-e). We trained GCaMP7s-expressing mice in the 2AA task, classified individual test trials as either avoidance or failure as described above and analyzed the corresponding change in fluorescent signal associated with presentations of the CS (Fig. 3f-k). To ensure sufficient numbers of avoidance and failure trials during imaging sessions, mice were trained for only 3 d before imaging started (Fig. 3d, e). These analyses revealed that pPVTD2R -NAc projections were rapidly engaged after CS presentation and were robustly activated during both avoidance and escape episodes irrespective of trial type (Fig. 3k). In contrast, CS-evoked freezing was associated with a reduction in GCaMP7s fluorescence in this projection (Fig. 3k). These calcium dynamics largely resembled those observed in pPVTD2R neurons (Fig. 2d-h and Extended Data Fig. 3b). Together, these findings demonstrate that pPVTD2R -NAc projections signal active avoidance and are suppressed during freezing behavior.\nFig. 3\npPVTD2R -NAc axon terminals signal active avoidance.\na , Schematic of the experimental approach for fiber photometry imaging of pPVTD2R -NAc terminals. b , Representative images of GCaMP7s expression in pPVTD2R neurons and optical fiber placement in NAc. c , Fiber placements (n = 4 mice). d , Avoidance Rate and CS Freezing across training and imaging sessions. e , Latency to avoid and ITI Freezing for data in e . f , Representative imaging traces from sample subject. g , Top, heat maps of calcium responses for avoidance and failure trials.

All data in the figure are shown as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m.\nSource data\nIt is important to highlight that, unlike calcium responses recorded from the cell bodies of pPVTD2R neurons, for which increases were readily observed during shuttling events (Fig. 2d), increases in GCaMP7 fluorescence in pPVTD2R -NAc terminals appeared to emerge mostly at the conclusion of avoidance behavior (CS offset) (Fig. 3f,g). One potential explanation to this finding is that calcium transients accompanying avoidance behavior could result in weaker fluorescent changes at pPVTD2R -NAc axon terminals, thereby limiting our ability to accurately detect these with fiber photometry. To circumvent this limitation, we employed a viral vector strategy that allowed us to record the cell bodies of NAc-projecting neurons directly in the pPVT (Fig. 4a,b). As with our axon terminal imaging experiment, mice were first trained in the 2AA task for three sessions, and then fiber photometry imaging from the cell bodies of pPVT-NAc neurons was performed during two additional sessions (Fig. 4c,d). Notably, our results largely resembled those obtained from pPVTD2R neurons (Fig. 4e-j). In particular, we noticed that, although pPVT-NAc neurons were strongly recruited during avoidance trials, they were mostly suppressed during failures (Fig. 4i). Moreover, pPVT-NAc neurons signaled active behavioral responses and were, instead, inhibited during freezing (Fig. 4e,j and Supplementary Video 2). Together, these findings demonstrate that pPVT projections to the NAc predominantly signal active defensive responses.\nFig. 4\nNAc-projecting neurons of the pPVT signal active avoidance.\na , Schematic of the experimental approach for fiber photometry imaging from pPVT-NAc neurons. b , Fiber placements (n = 5 mice). c , Avoidance Rate and CS freezing across training and imaging sessions. d , Latency to avoid and ITI freezing for data in c . e , Representative imaging traces from sample subject. f , Top, heat maps of calcium responses for avoidance and failure trials.

All data in the figure are shown as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m.\nSource data\nNext, to investigate whether activation of pPVT-NAc projections is critical for active avoidance, we optogenetically inhibited pPVTD2R -NAc projections bilaterally using Halo in a cohort of mice displaying robust avoidance behavior after training (>70% initial avoidance rate; Methods and Fig. 5a-c). Similarly to the experiment described above, after 2AA training (Fig. 5d-g) mice were subjected to three test sessions (Test Days 1-3), and, on Test Day 2, light stimulation was delivered through optical fibers to silence pPVTD2R -NAc communication during CS presentations. Unlike in control subjects, light stimulation in Halo-expressing mice significantly decreased avoidance rate and increased the latency to avoid (Fig. 5h,i). In addition, these mice showed a concomitant increase in CS-evoked freezing on Test Day 2 (Fig. 5j,k). Notably, pairwise comparison of light-evoked changes in freezing and avoidance behavior across test sessions revealed an inverse relationship between these two parameters (Fig. 5l). Together, these results demonstrate that silencing pPVTD2R -NAc communication biases defensive behavioral responses toward passive coping strategies. Notably, this effect is independent of the post-training avoidance rate, because similar observations were made in a cohort of mice in which the initial avoidance rate was markedly lower (Extended Data Fig. 5a-k). Moreover, our observation that optogenetic inhibition of pPVT-NAc projections on Test Day 2 lead to lasting behavioral effects on Test Day 3 indicates a potential role for this projection in the formation of persistent associations between fear cues and specific coping strategies. Finally, restricting optogenetic inhibition of pPVT-NAc projections to the ITI did not significantly alter behavior (Extended Data Fig. 5l-o). Similarly, as with pPVTD2R neurons, we did not observe any light stimulation-induced effect on locomotion (Extended Data Fig. 5p).\nFig. 5\nOptogenetic inhibition of pPVTD2R -NAc axon terminals decreases active avoidance and increases freezing.\na , Schematic of the viral vector strategy and optical fiber placement for optogenetic silencing of pPVTD2R -NAc axon terminals in the 2AA task. b , Representative images from a mouse expressing Halo-mCherry in pPVTD2R neurons (left) and implanted with optical fibers in the NAc (right). c , Fiber placements (n = 8 mice per group). d -g , Avoidance rate (d ), latency to avoid (e ), freezing time during the CS (f ) and ITI freezing (g ) across all training sessions for both Ctl and Halo groups. h -k , Left, Optogenetic inhibition of pPVTD2R -NAc axon terminals persistently decreases avoidance rate (h ), whereas increases latency to avoid (i ) and freezing time during the CS (j ), but has little effect on freezing time during the the ITI (k ).

All data in the figure are shown as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m.\nSource data\npPVT-CeA projections signal failure to avoid\nAs described above, pPVTD2R neurons that project to the NAc are mostly distinct from those that project to the CeA (Fig. 1)25 . However, these anatomical differences do not necessarily imply that functional distinctions exist between the two efferent pathways. Thus, to investigate how pPVTD2R -CeA projections are modulated in the 2AA task, we expressed GCaMP7s in pPVTD2R neurons of Drd2-Cre mice and implanted an optical fiber unilaterally in the CeA to measure the activity of pPVTD2R -CeA projections with fiber photometry (Fig. 6a-d). These experiments showed that, unlike pPVTD2R -NAc terminals, pPVTD2R -CeA projections are not positively modulated by avoidance (Fig. 6e-j). Surprisingly, CS-evoked freezing behavior was not associated with significant changes in GCaMP7s fluorescence (Fig. 6j). In contrast, pPVTD2R -CeA neurons were predominantly active during failure trials (Fig. 6g,j), suggesting a link between engagement of pPVTD2R -CeA projections and failure to avoid. Notably, previous studies have linked pPVT-CeA communication to the expression of conditioned fear--where Pavlovian reactions dominate behavior12,22 . Altogether, these findings suggest the existence of functional differences between pPVTD2R -CeA and pPVTD2R -NAc projections, with the activity of pPVTD2R -CeA projections increasing during failures (when freezing dominates (Fig. 6g)).\nFig. 6\nFiber photometry imaging of GCaMP7s fluorescence from the CeA terminals of pPVTD2R neurons in the 2AA task.\na , Schematic of the experimental approach for fiber photometry imaging pPVT-CeA terminals. b , Left, representative images of GCaMP7s expression and fiber placement.

Specifically, these studies showed that blocking protein synthesis in the CeA promotes active avoidance17 , whereas CeA lesions can unmask avoidance behavior in animals that initially fail to avoid after 2AA training16 . A major conclusion drawn from these studies is that CeA-driven Pavlovian reactions compete with and, thereby, prevent the expression of instrumental defensive behaviors. Because pPVT-CeA communication has been previously shown to support conditioned freezing behavior12,22 , we hypothesized that attenuating activity in pPVT-CeA projections could boost active avoidance. Consistent with this prediction, optogenetic silencing of pPVT-CeA projections using Halo reduced freezing behavior and promoted avoidance behavior (Extended Data Fig. 6a-k). Notably, this manipulation did not affect behavior when light simulation was restricted to the ITI period (Extended Data Fig. 6l-o). Together, these results suggest that silencing pPVT-CeA communication biases behavior away from passive defensive behavior and in favor of active ones. Similarly, we did not observe any light stimulation-induced effect on locomotion (Extended Data Fig. 6p).\nOf note, Halo-mediated silencing of pPVT-CeA projections also promoted active avoidance behavior in a subset of mice that failed to achieve >30% avoidance rate after the third 2AA session (Methods, Fig. 7 and Extended Data Fig. 7). Consistent with previous manipulations, the increase in avoidance behavior was accompanied by a reduction in the latency to avoid and a reduction in CS-evoked freezing (Fig. 7h,i). Moreover, pairwise comparisons revealed that, consistent with the idea that in the 2AA task animals switch between Pavlovian and instrumental defensive strategies, increases in active avoidance induced by silencing pPVT-CeA projections were linked to a reduction in freezing behavior (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Altogether, these results suggest that silencing pPVT-CeA communication biases behavior away from freezing and in favor of avoidance.\nFig. 7\nOptogenetic inhibition pPVTD2R -CeA axon terminals increases active avoidance and reduces freezing.\na , Schematic of the viral vector strategy and optical fiber placement used for optogenetic silencing of pPVTD2R -CeA axon terminals. b , Representative images from a mouse expressing Halo-mCherry in pPVTD2R neurons and implanted with optical fibers in the CeA. c , Fiber placements (n = 9 mice per group). d -f , Avoidance rate (d ), latency to avoid (e ) and freezing time during the CS (f ) across all training days in both Ctl and Halo groups. g -i , Top, avoidance rate (g ), latency to avoid (h ) and freezing time during the CS (i ) during optogenetic inhibition of pPVTD2R -CeA axon terminals.

All data in the figure are shown as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m.\nSource data\nOur collective observations indicate that task-related activity within the pPVT-NAc or the pPVT-CeA pathway biases defensive behavior toward active or passive responses, respectively. To investigate whether artificial stimulation of either pathway can generate behavioral bias, we expressed the red-shifted channelrhodopsin-2 variant ChrimsonR in pPVTD2R neurons and implanted optical fibers bilaterally over the NAc or the CeA. Consistent with our model, we observed that, although optogenetic stimulation of pPVT-NAc terminals potentiated avoidance behavior, stimulation of pPVT-CeA projections reduced it (Extended Data Fig. 8). These results lend further support to our conclusion that divergent projections of the pPVT mediate the selection of opposing defensive behaviors.\npPVT flexibly control the selection of defensive behaviors\nA recurrent theme in our reported observations is the idea that the pPVT projections to the NAc and the CeA can bias the selection of passive and active defensive behaviors. But whether these projections flexibly control defensive behavior is unclear. To assess this, we selectively silenced pPVT projections to the NAc and the CeA in the same subjects across two test sessions (Fig. 8 and Extended Data Fig. 9). Notably, we found that, although silencing pPVT-NAc projections impaired avoidance behavior (consistent with the above results), inhibition of pPVT-CeA terminals the next day fully restored active avoidance (Fig. 8e,f). Interestingly, an opposing but similarly dynamic modulation of freezing behavior was observed across sessions (Fig. 8g and Extended Data Fig. 9d). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the pPVT can flexibly bias defensive behaviors via projections to NAc and CeA. Future studies should aim at identifying the local circuit dynamics and upstream mechanisms that guide or determine which type of defensive response is selected. As a start, using monosynaptic rabies tracing, we identified regions of the mouse brain that preferentially innervate pPVT-CeA or pPVT-NAc neurons (Extended Data Fig. 10).\nFig. 8\npPVTD2R projections to the NAc and the CeA flexibly bias the selection of defensive behaviors.\na , Schematic of the viral vector strategy and optical fiber placement for optogenetic silencing of pPVTD2R -NAc or pPVTD2R -CeA axon terminals in the same subject. b -d , Avoidance rate (b ), latency to avoid (c ) and freezing time during the CS (d ) across all training sessions for both Ctl and Halo groups (n = 8 mice per group). e -g , Top, Optogenetic inhibition of pPVTD2R -NAc axon terminals (Day 2) decreases avoidance rate (e ), increases latency to avoid (f ) and freezing time during the CS (g ), whereas following optogenetic inhibition of pPVTD2R -CeA axon terminals (Day 3) reverses these changes.

Mice used in this study were group housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle (6:00-18:00 light), at temperature of 70-74 \u00b0F and 40-65% humidity, with food and water available ad libitum. After surgery, mice were singly housed. Drd2-Cre mice were obtained from GENSAT (founder line ER44). In addition, we used C57BL/6NJ strain mice (The Jackson Laboratory). Both male and female mice 8-20 weeks of age were used for all experiments. Animals were randomly allocated to the different experimental conditions reported in this study.\nViral vectors\nAAV9-hSyn-Flex-GCaMP6s-WPRE-SV40 was produced by the Vector Core of the University of Pennsylvania. AAV9-EF1[alpha]-DIO-eNpHR3.0-mCherry, AAV2-CaMKII2[alpha]-eNpHR3.0-mCherry, AAV2-CaMKII2[alpha]-mCherry, AAV2-EF1[alpha]-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-YFP-WPRE and AAV2-EF1[alpha]-DIO-mCherry were produced by the Vector Core of the University of North Carolina. AAV5-hSyn-FLEX-ChrimsonR-tdTomato (Addgene, plasmid no. 62723), AAV9-CAG-FLEX-tdTomato (Addgene, plasmid no. 28306) and AAV9-Syn-Flex-jGCaMP7s-WPRE (Addgene, plasmid no. 104491) were purchased from Addgene. AAV2(retro)-CAG-iCre (Addgene, plasmid no. 81070) was produced by Vector Biolabs. AAV9-EF1a-FLEX-TVA-mCherry (Addgene, plasmid no. 38044) and AAV9-CAG-FLEX-RG (Addgene, plasmid no. 38043) were produced by Vigene Biosciences. EnvA-SAD-[DELTA]G-eGFP (Addgene, plasmid no. 32635) was produced by the Viral Vector Core of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. All viral vectors were stored in aliquots at -80 \u00b0C until use.\nStereotaxic surgery\nAll viral injections were performed using previously described procedures12 and an AngleTwo stereotaxic device (Leica Biosystems) at the following stereotaxic coordinates: pPVT, -1.60 mm from bregma, 0.06 mm lateral from midline and -3.30 mm vertical from cortical surface, 6.12\u00b0 angle for both fiber photometry and optogenetics; NAc, 1.70 mm from bregma, 0.60 mm lateral from midline and -4.60 mm vertical from cortical surface, 9.99\u00b0 angle for optogenetics; CeA, -1.42 mm from bregma, 2.90 mm lateral from midline and -4.80 mm vertical from cortical surface. For fiber photometry and optogenetic experiments, an optical fiber (400 [mu]m for photometry, Doric Lenses; 200 [mu]m for optogenetics, ThorLabs) was implanted over the target immediately after viral injections and cemented using Metabond Cement System (Parkell) and Jet Brand dental acrylic (Lang Dental Manufacturing). For retrograde tracing of NAc-projecting and CeA-projecting pPVT cells, CTB-647 and CTB-555 (1.0% in PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were injected into the NAc (0.5 [mu]l) and CeA (0.3 [mu]l), respectively, and allowed 4 d for retrograde transport. After all surgical procedures, animals were returned to their home cages and placed on a heating pad for 24 h for post-surgical recovery and monitoring. Animals received subcutaneous injections with Metacam (meloxicam, 1-2 mg kg-1 ) for analgesia and anti-inflammatory purposes. Mice without correct targeting of optical fibers, tracers or vectors were excluded from this study.\nFiber photometry\nFiber photometry was performed as previously described28,29 . Briefly, mice were allowed to habituate to the fiber patch cord in their home cage for approximately 5 min before each behavior test. GCaMP fluorescence and isosbestic autofluorescence signals were excited by the fiber photometry system (Doric Lenses) using two sinusoidally modulated 473 nm (211 Hz) and 405 nm (531 Hz) LEDs (DC4100, ThorLabs). Both LEDs were combined via a commercial Mini Cube fiber photometry apparatus (Doric Lenses) into a fiber patch cord (400-[mu]m core, 0.48 NA) connected to the brain implant in each mouse. The light intensity at the interface between the fiber tip and the animal was adjusted from 10 [mu]W to 20 [mu]W (but was constant throughout each test session for each mouse). An RZ5P fiber photometry acquisition system with Synapse software (Tucker-Davis Technologies) collected and saved real-time demodulated emission signals and behavior-relevant TTL inputs. For each trial, GCaMP signals (F 473 nm ) were compared with autofluorescence signals (F 405 nm ) to control for movement and bleaching artifacts. Signal data were de-trended by first applying a least-squares linear fit to produce F fitted 405 nm , and dF /F was calculated as (F 473 nm - F fitted 405 nm )/F fitted 405 nm . All GCaMP signal data are presented as the z-score of the dF /F from baseline (pre-CS) segments.\nFear conditioning\nBefore training, mice were handled and habituated to the fiber patch cord in the conditioning context. Mice were fear conditioned in a Mouse Test Cage (18 cm \u00d7 18 cm \u00d7 30 cm) equipped with an electrifiable floor connected to a shock generator (H13-15, Coulbourn Instruments) and placed inside a sound attenuated cabinet (H10-24A, Coulbourn Instruments). The auditory fear conditioning procedure was carried in two different contexts: a Context A (habituation and conditioning) and a Context B (retrieval). The cabinet was illuminated at all times, and the subject's behavior was captured with a USB camera (ACT-VP-02, Coulbourn Instruments) at 3.7 Hz during each session. FreezeFrame software (Actimetrics) was used to control the delivery of both 4-kHz, 75-dB tones (30 s; CS) and 0.6-mA footshocks (2 s; US).\nFor habituation, a 120-s pre-stimulus interval (PSI) was followed by four trials of CS presentations with pseudorandom 30-60-s ITI in Context A. Fear conditioning was conducted in Context A. The same PSI was followed by five trials of CS presentations that co-terminated with the US, with pseudorandom 30-60-s ITI. A fear memory retrieval session was conducted in Context B. The same PSI was followed by eight trials of unreinforced CS presentations with pseudorandom 30-120-s ITI. Freezing behavior was recorded and analyzed with FreezeFrame. For the retrieval session, the freezing data of all the trials were linearly aligned from maximus to minimum (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Based on the distribution, all trials were divided into three groups: low freezing (L; Freezing <40%; n = 20 trials), moderate freezing (M; 40%[less than or equal to] Freezing [less than or equal to]60%; n = 16 trials) and high freezing (H; Freezing >60%; n = 12 trials).\n2AA\nMice were trained on the 2AA as previously described16 . Briefly, the behavioral apparatus consisted of a custom-built shuttle box (18 cm \u00d7 36 cm \u00d7 30 cm) that contained two identical chambers separated by a hurdle (17.5 cm \u00d7 6 cm). The hurdle projected 3 cm above the floor and allowed mice easy access to both chambers. The floor consisted of electrifiable metal rods (H10-11M-TC-SF, Coulbourn Instruments) and was connected to a shock generator (H13-15, Coulbourn Instruments). Before each subject was trained/tested, the shuttle box was wiped clean with 70% ethanol. The mouse's behavior was captured with a USB camera during each session. A speaker located on the top of the shuttle box (50 cm high) was used to deliver the CS. Subjects' movement and TTLs of CS, US and optogenetic stimulation were recorded by ANY-maze version 5 (Stoelting).\nAfter a 5-min habituation period, mice were trained with daily sessions of 2AA, each consisting of 30 presentations of the CS (lasting up to 15 s each). Trials in which subjects failed to shuttle to the adjacent chamber before the termination of the CS resulted in the presentation of the US (lasting up to 15 s each) until subjects escaped to the opposite chamber (failure trials). For trials in which subjects shuttled to the opposite chamber during the CS, the CS was abruptly terminated, and the US was also prevented (avoidance trials). Avoidance rate was calculated as the percentage of the number of avoidance trials over the total number of trials.\nIn Fig. 2a-h, mice were subjected to five 2AA sessions (one session per day), and the GCaMP signal was collected on Days 4-5 as described above. In Fig. 2i-l, mice were initially trained for 5 d. If a subject did not reach 30% of avoidance rate by Day 5, it was not used in further test sessions. Test sessions consisted of CS presentations (no US). In the second test session, subjects received light stimulation with a yellow light source (Ce:YAG + LED Driver, Doric Lenses) during each CS presentation (light onset was 5 s before the onset of the CS and culminated 5 s after the offset of the CS). The light intensity at the interface between the fiber tip and the mouse was ~10 mW. In Figs. 3, 4 and 6, mice were initially trained for 3 d. GCaMP signal was collected across Days 4-5. In Fig. 5, mice were initially trained for 3 d. If a subject did not reach 70% of avoidance rate by Day 3, it was not used in further testing sessions. As described above, these test sessions involved CS presentations (no US), and the subjects received light stimulation paired to CS presentations during the second test session. In Fig. 7, we selectively screened for poor avoiders as follows: mice with [less than or equal to]30% of avoidance rate by Training Day 3 were poor avoiders used for further test. As these are essentially mice that failed to learn active avoidance, subsequent test sessions involved presentations of both the CS and the US while subjects received light stimulation paired to the CS from the second to the sixth test sessions. In Extended Data Figs. 5-8, mice were initially trained for 3 d and tested with another 3 d subsequently. These test sessions involved both CS and US presentations, and the subjects received light stimulation paired to CS presentations during the second test session. For experiments in which we optogenetically manipulated pPVT or its circuits during ITIs (Extended Data Figs. 4-6), mice were initially trained for 3 d and tested with another 3 d subsequently. These test sessions involved both CS and US presentations, and the subjects received light stimulation paired to ITIs during the second test session. In Fig. 8 and Extended Data Fig. 9, mice were initially trained for 3 d and tested with another 4 d subsequently. These test sessions involved both CS and US presentations, and the subjects received light stimulation paired to CS presentations through NAc-implanted opto fibers during the second test session and CeA-implanted opto fibers during the third test session.\nData analysis for 2AA\nWe performed post hoc position tracking of the animal's nose and body center from video in the software TopScan (CleverSys). CS and US times from ANY-maze and raw video tracking position values from TopScan were exported, and analysis was performed with custom routines in the R statistical computing environment (R Core Team 2019, R Foundation).\nMissing positions up to ten successive frames were linearly interpolated with custom routines in R. For imaging sessions, video tracking and ANY-maze TTL pulse timestamps were zero corrected to align behavioral and calcium signal timestamps. Next, calcium signals and/or position frames during US and CS were flagged by matching the relevant timestamps to TTL pulse times from ANY-maze, and the frame-by-frame distance traveled for the nose and body center was calculated for the tracking data. To minimize the effects of noise in the tracking data, we calculated the 40% quantile of the frame-by-frame distance traveled by the animal's nose and body center for each session; in all cases, this yielded a distance value of 0 or 1 mm. This quantile value served as a movement threshold--that is, an inter-frame distance traveled less than or equal to the quantile value was considered non-movement. We then created a binary vector, and frames with coincident immobility of the nose and center body were set to 1. Changepoint analysis55 (R package version 2.2.2 (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=changepoint)), with a minimum segment length of 30 video frames, was then applied to this vector. This approach allowed us to statistically determine when transitions to (and from) coincident periods of non-movement of nose and body occurred, which were used as a proxy for freezing behavior. Next, each sustained bout of non-movement was isolated, and we probed whether there was any movement that lasted for [greater than or equal to]5 consecutive video frames. If such movement did occur, we truncated the bout of immobility at the start of movement. Finally, immobility bouts with a duration [greater than or equal to]1 s were considered freezing. To ensure robustness of our method, we compared statistically derived event flags against manually scored videos in a subset of behavioral sessions.\nWe isolated freezing events (see freeze detection section above) that occurred during the CS as CS freezing and those that occurred during ITI as ITI freezing. For each trial, we calculated the time interval between the moment of animal crossing the hurdle and the CS onset, named latency to avoid. CS, ITI freezing or latency to avoid were average within session and then within each group and plotted as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m.\nFor fiber photometry, GCaMP data were normalized as dF /F . Next, we used the behavioral flags calculated from the video tracking to create average peri-event time histograms (PETHs) time-locked to the onset of the behavior events of interest, including CS onset (CS), highest movement velocity during the CS (Max. Velocity), escape or avoidance movement onset (Escape Initiate), escape or avoidance moment (Escape) and freezing onset during the CS (Freezing). All trials in each session were separated into avoidance and failure trials as described above. For each trial type, the z-score from 10 s before to 30 s after CS onset was plotted in heat maps for all trials in test sessions. The mean of all recorded activity for each trial type was plotted below the corresponding heat map. We isolated the calcium signal from 2 s before to 2 s after the onset of each behavior event from avoidance and failure trials separately. Using the 2 s before the onset as a baseline for each event, we calculated z-scores and area under the curve (AUC) of the z-score from 2 s after the onset of each behavior event. Lastly, we plotted the mean of signal transitions and AUC for each event type from each trial type. All 2AA photometric signals and behavioral performance were analyzed blinded.\nOptogenetic inhibition of pPVT neurons and projections in an open field arena\nAfter habituating to the fiber patch cord in the home cage for 10 min, mice were placed in a square enclosure (50 cm \u00d7 50 cm) to roam freely for 6 min. Mice received 2 min of light stimulation 2 min after the beginning of the test (min 2-4). The light intensity at the interface between the fiber tip and the mouse was ~10 mW. The cumulative distance traveled in the open field apparatus was tracked, recorded and quantified using ANY-maze behavioral tracking software.\nMonosynaptic tracing of inputs to NAc-projecting or CeA-projecting neurons of the PVT\nTo limit monosynaptic rabies tracing to NAc-projecting or CeA-projecting neurons of the PVT, AAV2(retro)-CAG-iCre was bilaterally injected into the NAc (0.5 [mu]l per injection) or CeA (0.3 [mu]l per injection) of C57BL/6NJ mice. Within the same surgical procedure, a virus mixture of AAV9-EF1a-FLEX-TVA-mCherry and AAV9-CAG-FLEX-RG at a 1:1 ratio was injected into the pPVT (1.5 [mu]l), followed by an injection of the pseudotyped rabies virus EnvA-SAD-[DELTA]G-eGFP (1.5 [mu]l) in the same location of pPVT 2 weeks later. Mouse brain tissues were collected and subjected to analysis 1 week later. Brain sections were scanned by an AxioScan (Carl Zeiss) with a \u00d75 objective. Cells were detected and quantified on NeuroInfo (MBF Bioscience). Starter cell count was generated by quantifying number of mCherry and GFP double-positive pPVT cells. We generated a connectivity index by normalizing the fraction of retrogradely labeled (GFP+ ) cells for a given brain region to the number of starter cells. Connectivity indices for each region were average within groups (CeA-projecting and NAc-projecting). Regions neighboring the pPVT (midline and medial thalamic nuclei) were excluded from our analyses due to the possibility of artifacts related to the injection site. All monosynaptic rabies tracing data were analyzed by a blinded experimenter.\nHistology and immunofluorescence\nAnimals were deeply anesthetized with euthanasia solution (Vet One) and transcardially perfused with PBS (pH 7.4, 4 \u00b0C), followed by paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution (4% in PBS, 4 \u00b0C). After extraction, brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 \u00b0C for a minimum of 2 h and subsequently cryoprotected by transferring to a 30% PBS-buffered sucrose solution until brains were saturated (for over 24 h). Coronal brain sections (50 [mu]m) were cut using a freezing microtome (SM 2010R, Leica). For immunofluorescence staining, brain sections were incubated in PBS (pH 7.4) with 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h and then incubated using the following antibody (overnight, at 4 \u00b0C): anti-D2R (1:300, rabbit, Frontier Institute, D2R-Rb-Af960). After washing, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, goat anti-mouse, Molecular Probes A-11001). Finally, sections were subsequently mounted onto glass slides for imaging (LSM 780 laser scanning confocal microscope, Carl Zeiss). Image analysis and cell counting were performed using ImageJ software (Fiji, version 1.52p). Optical fiber placements for all mice included in this study are presented in Figs 2a, 3c, 4b, 5c, 6b and 7c and Extended Data Figs. 1a, 4b,l, 5b, 6b, 8b,m and 9a.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nAll data were plotted and analyzed with OriginPro version 2016 and version 2018 (OriginLab) and GraphPad Prism (version 8.0.1, GraphPad Software). All data are presented as mean [plus or minus] s.e.m. There were no assumptions or corrections made before data analysis. Differences between two groups were tested with a two-tailed Student's t -test; differences among multiple groups were examined with analysis of variance (ANOVA, one-way and two-way repeated-measures) followed by two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli; P < 0.05 was considered significant. The sample sizes used in our study, such as the numbers of animals, are typically the same or exceed those estimated by power analysis (power = 0.80, [alpha] = 0.05). For tracing experiments, the sample size is 2-5 mice. For fiber photometry experiments, the sample size is 4-6 mice. For optogenetic experiments, the sample size is 4-13 mice. All experiments were replicated at least once, and similar results were obtained. All experiments were randomized, and investigators were blinded to allocation during experiments. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested\nReporting Summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nOnline content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00912-7.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank former NIMH postbac N.

        "discussion": "Discussion\nIn this study, we identified the pPVT as a key brain structure that mediates the selection of competing defensive strategies, namely Pavlovian freezing and instrumental behavior. These findings add to a growing body of literature that places the PVT as an important regulator of emotional and motivational processes31,32 . Notably, we uncovered that the anatomical and functional segregation of PVT projections to the CeA and the NAc underscores its role in biasing behavioral selection. Collectively, these findings expand on previous studies linking PVT function to passive defensive responses12,22,28,33 , provide a circuit mechanism by which opposing defensive strategies are leveraged8 and support the notion that the PVT is critical for the orchestration of adaptive behavioral responses32,34,35 .\nRecent literature shows that the pPVT is predominantly sensitive to aversive stimuli28,29 . In turn, the pPVT appears to orchestrate adaptive responses that allow animals to cope with ongoing demands36 . Consistent with this view and in addition to its role in driving Pavlovian defensive reactions, the pPVT is now recognized to promote goal-directed instrumental responses, including food seeking, drug seeking and maternal behaviors37-41 . Importantly, some of these studies have directly implicated NAc projections of the pPVT as guiding instrumental behaviors during aversive states38-43 . In light of these recent reports, our finding that the pPVT-NAc pathway also regulates instrumental defensive behaviors suggests that these projections might generally promote goal-directed behaviors. From this perspective, the pPVT-CeA pathway could support behavioral strategies that favor Pavlovian responding irrespective of whether responses are reward oriented or defensive in nature36 . Accordingly, it was recently proposed that pPVT-CeA projections drive morphine-induced conditioned place preference likely through Pavlovian incentive motivation44 .\nThe pPVT is not the only brain region that innervates both the NAc and the CeA. Indeed, the BLA and the insular cortex also send divergent projection to these structures, and these projections have been implicated in emotional and motivational processes14,19,45-47 . Particularly relevant to the present study is the notion that the BLA has been shown to contribute to both conditioned freezing and active avoidance behavior via its projections to the CeA and the NAc, respectively. This leads to the question of what the differential contributions of the BLA and the PVT are to these opposing defensive behaviors. One possibility discussed earlier in this manuscript is that the BLA's contribution to conditioned passive and active defensive behaviors decreases over time20-22 . As such, the PVT might increasingly become the dominant pathway by which freezing and active avoidance behaviors are regulated. Alternatively, and possibly in addition to this time-dependent role, the PVT might serve to contextualize aversive memories by integrating these with information about internal state (owing to its strong innervation by the hypothalamus and the brainstem). Consistent with this idea, the PVT has been recently proposed to arbiter amid motivational conflicts32 . Future studies should aim to identify the precise mechanisms by which the PVT regulates behavior and how these differ from those of other regions known to regulate the same behaviors.\nEmergent studies support the notion that the neuronal circuits of the PVT are functionally diverse31 . Indeed, we recently identified two major classes of PVT neurons that can be distinguished on the basis of genetic, anatomic (connectional) and functional differences29 . Specifically, it was suggested that PVT neuronal subtypes could be identified by their expression, or lack thereof, of the Drd2 gene (and D2R protein). Functionally, compared to D2R-negative PVT neurons, which, at the population level, appear to be modulated by stimulus salience, D2R-expressing neurons are primarily sensitive to aversive stimuli28,29 . Our results expand on this recent report by showing further anatomical and functional heterogeneity among aversive-sensitive pPVTD2R neurons.\nIt is important to note that non-D2R-expressing PVT neurons also project to the NAc and the amygdala29 . However, the contributions of these parallel projections (and how they differ to those of D2R-expressing neurons) to defensive behaviors remain unaddressed. Our findings should encourage future studies to classify PVT neurons based on the intersection of genetic markers and projection target31 , an approach that has led to the discovery of functional segregation in other brain areas48-52 . In addition, implementing imaging techniques with cellular resolution should facilitate the identification of functionally distinct PVT cell types that might have remained undetected in our experiments using bulk imaging approaches from projection-defined neurons.\nThe observation that optogenetic inhibition of pPVT-NAc projections leads to lasting reductions in active avoidance behavior is reminiscent of a previous report demonstrating that silencing pPVT-CeA projections produces similar lasting effects in freezing behavior during fear memory retrieval22 . In that study, the authors concluded that the persistent reduction in freezing behavior indicated an overall role for this pathway in controlling the maintenance of fear memories. Our findings are at odds with this interpretation. Specifically, we found that, although silencing of pPVT-NAc projections reduced active avoidance, it led to a concomitant increase in CS-evoked freezing. As such, our findings do not support a conclusion in which persistent reductions in avoidance behavior resulting from pPVT-NAc silencing are due to deficits in fear memory maintenance. Instead, in light of this previous report and our collective findings, we propose that the activation of pPVT projections to the NAc and the CeA links fear (CS/US) associations to the selection of specific defensive strategies. As such, our findings help remodel current views on the role that the PVT plays in the formation and maintenance of aversive memories. Subsequent studies in this topic should aim at identifying the local and upstream circuit mechanisms that promote behavioral bias.\nA major focus of the present study was to uncover the neural circuit mechanisms by which animals switch between two opposing defensive behaviors: freezing and active avoidance. In nature, animals typically engage in these different defensive behaviors as a function of threat imminence8-10 . From this perspective, active avoidance is thought to have evolved as a way to deal with temporally and spatially distant threats (pre-encounter)53 , whereas freezing behavior and other reactive responses, such as flight, mostly emerge during highly imminent threats (post-encounter and circa-strike)10 . Within this framework, the idea that the 2AA task yields a subset of animals that fail to engage in avoidance behavior (low avoiders) might seem to suggest that this task is not suitable for studying ethologically relevant defensive strategies. However, a potential explanation for the variability in behavioral outcome observed with the current task, particularly the low avoider phenotype, could be that, due to the short duration of the CS (15 s), some animals view the threat (US) as highly imminent and, thus, display freezing behavior when avoidance is possible. Consistent with this notion, a recent study demonstrated that reducing threat imminence by increasing the duration of the CS virtually eliminates low avoiders53 . This study underscores the notion that parameters of the 2AA task (including CS and ITI duration) can be optimized to mimic naturalistic differences in threat imminence. In the current study, we exploited individual differences in animal performance that are harnessed by standard 2AA protocols to obtain information about the mechanisms that mediate switches in defensive behavior strategy. We predict that the circuit mechanisms described in our study for biasing the selection of opposing defensive behaviors mirror those engaged when animals switch defensive strategies as a function of threat imminence. Developing ethologically relevant behavioral models in which animals engage in both pre-encounter (active) and post-encounter reactive defensive modes (for example, freezing) with varying degrees of threat imminence would allow for further exploring the neurobiology of defensive behavior selection. Of note, ethologically relevant behavioral tasks have been recently developed to assess transitions between post-encounter and circa-strike elicited defense54 .",

        "abstract": "The present study was conducted to investigate whether the smell and sight of coffee (without tasting it) induced a conditioned response, and to compare the effect of the smell and sight of coffee in high- and low-consumption coffee drinkers. If classical conditioning caused the reduced reaction time effect, it was predicted that the degree of effect of caffeine-related stimuli would depend on the degree of experience of the pairing of conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US). Sixty-six undergraduate students were randomly allocated to either a coffee or water presentation group and completed a simple reaction time task. Linear mixed modeling revealed that years of coffee consumption predicted reaction time when participants were presented coffee. The result coincided with the prediction that the greater the degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US, the greater the conditioned response would be. In conclusion, the present study showed that the smell and sight of coffee (without tasting it) induced a conditioned response and the direction was that of a caffeine-like effect. At least in behavioral effect, different types of caffeine CS uniformly induce a caffeine-like effect. Future studies should investigate the effect of the smell \"or\" sight of coffee to determine the relationship between CS type and direction of response.\nAuthor(s): Mina Fukuda 1\nAuthor Affiliations:\n(1) grid.412021.4, 0000 0004 1769 5590, Department of Psychological Sciences, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, , 1757 Kanazawa, Tobetsu-cho, 061-0293, Ishikari-gun, Hokkaido, Japan",
        "introduction": "Introduction\nCaffeine consumption induces various subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects (see review: Nehlig 2010; Smith 2002). For example, caffeine consumption increased subjective alertness (e.g., Bonnet et al. 1995; Haskell et al. 2005; Johnson et al. 1990; Lieberman et al. 2002; Leathwood and Pollet 1982; Rusted 1994; Smith et al. 1992; Smith et al. 1993; Smith et al. 1994a; Smith et al. 1994b; Smith et al. 1997; Warburton 1995). Many studies have shown that caffeine consumption shortens simple reaction time (e.g., Attwood et al. 2010; Clubley et al. 1979) and choice reaction time (Durlach et al. 2002; Smith et al. 1997; Lieberman et al. 1987; Roache and Griffiths 1987). In addition, caffeine consumption has been found to affect sleep latency (e.g. Zwyghuizen-Doorenbos et al. 1990) and duration (Hicks et al. 1983).\nSome studies have found that a neutral stimulus can become associated with a drug (e.g., Attwood et al. 2010; Birak et al. 2011; Dafters and Anderson 1982; Shapiro and Nathan 1986; Staiger and White 1988), and several studies have also shown that the taste, smell, and sight of the drug (e.g., decaffeinated coffee, non-alcoholic drink) can acquire the properties of a conditioned stimulus (CS) even though acquisition trials were not conducted in these studies (e.g., Adan et al. 2008; Andrews et al. 1998; Flaten et al. 2003; Flaten and Blumenthal 1999; Fukuda and Aoyama 2017; Fukuda et al. 2014; Marczinski and Fillmore 2005; Mikalsen et al. 2001; Newlin 1989; Remington et al. 1997; Rozin et al. 1984; Zwyghuizen-Doorenbos et al. 1990).\nA conditioned response can occur in either of two directions. A response that runs counter to that associated with a given drug is known as a conditioned compensatory response (CCR; Siegel 1975), which is a type of conditioned response (CR). In other words, a stimulus paired with a drug can induce a drug-opposite effect. Other studies using caffeine as an unconditioned stimulus (US) have demonstrated a CCR similar to that found by Rozin et al. (1984). On the other hand, some studies have reported that a caffeine-related stimulus induced a caffeine-like effect (e.g., Adan et al. 2008; Andrews et al. 1998; Attwood et al. 2010; Flaten et al. 2003; Flaten and Blumenthal 1999; Fukuda and Aoyama 2017; Fukuda et al. 2014; Zwyghuizen-Doorenbos et al. 1990). Therefore, a caffeine CS can induce either a caffeine-like or a caffeine-opposite effect. According to Staiger and White (1988), in an alcohol study, it is the nature of the stimuli that determines the direction of the response (i.e., an alcohol-like response is determined by a drink CS, whereas an alcohol-opposite response is determined by a room CS or a drink + room CS).\nIn human classical conditioning, a conditioning procedure (i.e., the pairing of a CS and a US) and other factors (e.g., verbal information) are the sources of learning (e.g., Stewart-Williams and Podd 2004). Most previous studies have used drink CS (the taste, smell, and sight of coffee) and provided verbal information such as participants being told that their drink is decaffeinated (e.g., Adan et al. 2008; Andrews et al. 1998; Flaten et al. 2003; Flaten and Blumenthal 1999; Fukuda and Aoyama 2017; Zwyghuizen-Doorenbos et al. 1990). However, verbal information may distort the effect of CS. Therefore, the present study used the smell and sight of coffee (without tasting it) CS to determine the effect of conditioning procedure by itself. Participants were presented with coffee on a desk with no instruction about the content of caffeine. A clarification of the effect of CS by itself may reveal the direction of the conditioned response.\nThe present study was conducted to investigate whether the smell and sight of coffee (without tasting it) induced a conditioned response. Moreover, this study attempted to compare the effect of the smell and sight of coffee in high- and low-consumption coffee drinkers. If classical conditioning caused the reduced reaction time effect, it was predicted that the degree of the effect of caffeine-related stimuli would depend on the degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US. From the principle of classical conditioning, caffeine-related stimuli induce a caffeine-like effect in habitual coffee drinkers. Moreover, the degree of caffeine-like effect may be greater when the number of times that the smell and sight of coffee (conditioned stimulus) have been paired with caffeine (unconditioned stimulus) is high. That is, in high-consumption coffee drinkers, the degree of conditioned response would be large (and vice versa). As demonstrated in many studies (that investigated the behavioral effect of caffeine) that determined that caffeine induces a shortened simple reaction time effect (e.g., Clubley et al. 1979; Nehlig 2010; Smith 2002), this study also used a simple reaction time task to measure conditioned response.",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants\nThe 66 participants (13 men, 53 women) were undergraduate students. Participants were asked to abstain from caffeinated drinks (e.g., coffee, energy drinks) for two hours before the testing. The abstinence time was established based on a previous study that investigated the effects of decaffeinated coffee (Dawkins et al. 2011). However, the median abstinence time was 45.42 h, and most participants abstained approximately 12 h. This is consistent with previous research that established more severe abstinence periods (the evening before testing; e.g., Elliman et al. 2010). Therefore, this study had sufficient abstinence time. The participants were randomly allocated to either a coffee presentation (C group; n = 36) or a water presentation (W group; n = 30) group.\nMaterials\nA coffee maker and a glass pitcher (for the C group) or bottled water and a glass pot (for the W group) were present on a desk. In the C group, the coffee was brewed in a \"Nescafe Gold Blend\" (Nestle Japan Limited) coffee maker. This coffee was used in a previous study (Fukuda et al. 2014). The participants were presented with the smell and sight of coffee in the coffee maker and the glass pot. In the W group, bottled water (Suntory Beverage & Food Limited) and water in the glass pot were presented to the participants.\nQuestionnaire\nThe questionnaire, which the participants filled out after the task, assessed subjective rating during the task and participants' characteristics. The subjective rating assessed arousal during the simple reaction time (SRT) task retrospectively. The subjective rating was provided using 100 mm visual analog scales with the anchors being not at all and extremely . The question items regarding participants' characteristics related to the following: age, gender, the time and amount of coffee last consumed, frequency of coffee consumption (times/month), usual coffee consumption (ml; an example: canned coffee = 180 ml), and number of years of coffee consumption.\nSRT Task\nThe participants completed an SRT task (Attwood et al. 2010; Fukuda and Aoyama 2017). In this task, a stimulus (asterisk) was presented in the middle of the computer screen. The participants pressed the space key as quickly as possible when the stimulus was presented. If the participants pressed the key or the stimulus was presented for up to 1 s, the stimulus disappeared. The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) varied randomly between 1 and 2.5 s. This task consisted of 10 practice trials (before pre-session) and 100 test trials (pre-session and post-sessions 1, 2, and 3). Each session of the task took about 5 min. The task was programmed in SuperLab 4.5 (Cedrus Corporation).\nProcedure\nThe experiment was conducted in May 2017. The entire procedure took about 30 min. Students from a psychology class at Doshisha University were recruited for this study. All participants provided written informed consent. First, the SRT task was explained (10 practice trials were conducted), and participants completed the SRT task (pre-session, 100 trials) in the first room, which did not have a coffee maker or a glass pot. Then, the participants went to the next room, wherein a coffee maker and a glass pot (for the C group) or bottled water and a glass pot (for the W group) were present on a desk. The reason for using two experimental rooms was to avoid participants being exposed to caffeine-associated stimuli during the pre-session. The participants were asked to pour coffee (in the C group) or water (in the W group) into a cup from the glass pot. The cup was placed beside the computer. Then, the participants completed the SRT task three times (post-sessions 1, 2, and 3, 100 trials each) on this computer. The participants had a one-minute break between the sessions. They were not permitted to drink the coffee or water in the cup during the experiment. After post-session 3, the participants returned to the first room and filled out the questionnaire. After completing the experiment, participants were compensated with course credits.\nStatistical Analyses\nAll statistical procedures were performed using IBM SPSS Statistical Software, Version 24.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).\nFinally, this study had several limitations. First, further research should investigate the mechanisms of the conditioned response to a caffeine-associated stimulus. Previous research that examined such a response to caffeine did not provide any hypotheses regarding the neural mechanisms behind the conditioned response (e.g. Attwood et al. 2010). It is known that caffeine stimulates the autonomic nervous system (Zahn and Rapoport 1987). Hence, it is possible that the caffeine-associated stimuli may produce an effect of heightened attention and/or improved responsiveness. Second, subjective arousal was measured only at the end of the experiment because subjective arousal was a supplementary measure. The subjective effect of caffeine-related stimuli should be further considered in future research. Moreover, arousal should be investigated from many directions. For example, skin-galvanization response is a more accurate measure of arousal than self-report. Further study should measure arousal using both subjective and physiological methods. Third, a more accurate measurement of coffee consumption should be considered in further research. For example, participants keeping a diary about coffee consumption for several weeks might help clarify participants' coffee consumption. Fourth, it is possible that the effect of coffee presentation did not result from classical conditioning. For example, perhaps participants in the coffee group with high coffee consumption responded faster simply because they found stimuli related to coffee innately improving performance. However, if the effect changes according to participants' history, the effect was caused by learning. That is, this effect may be a conditioned response rather than an unconditioned response. Fifth, the simple reaction time task was conducted three times after the drinking session to determine when the CR would occur. However, the effect of initial rise of CR was not found. Future research should use only one session because a conditioning effect should appear in the first post-session.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Professor Kenjiro Aoyama of Doshisha University for his comments on this study.\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\n<sec>\nFunding\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nConflict of Interest\nThe author has no conflict of interest to declare.\n<sec>\nEthical Approval\nThe Institutional Review Board of Doshisha University approved this study.",

Because the repeated pairing of CS and US causes CR, frequency and years of coffee consumption (presumably the number of times of pairing) were used as the predictors. Outcome variables were reaction times in post-sessions 1, 2, and 3. Models included presentation group (water vs coffee; between-subjects), test number (post-sessions 1, 2, 3; repeated measure), frequency of coffee consumption (continuous variable), years of coffee consumption (continuous variable), and pre-reaction time (continuous variable) as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect.\nAs predicted, the Group x Years of coffee consumption interaction was significant (see Table 3). That is, the longer the years of coffee consumption, the shorter the reaction time in the C group (B = -345.41). On the other hand, the Group x Frequency of coffee consumption and the Group x Frequency x Years of coffee consumption interactions were not significant. That is, only years of coffee consumption predicts reaction time when participants are presented coffee. Therefore, years of coffee consumption is used as a predictor variable in the analysis below.

        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe present study was conducted to investigate the smell and sight of coffee (without tasting it) induced conditioned response. Moreover, this study also attempted to compare the effect of the smell and sight of coffee in high- and low-consumption coffee drinkers. If classical conditioning caused the reduced reaction time effect, it was predicted that the degree of the effect of caffeine-related stimuli would depend on the degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US. In the reaction time results, years of coffee consumption predicted reaction time when participants were presented coffee. On the other hand, in the subjective arousal results, the group-related effects were not significant.\nThe reaction time results coincided with the prediction that the greater the degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US, the greater the conditioned response would be. However, the predictor of reaction time was only the years of coffee consumption. Why did no other experience measures predict reaction time? The degree of conditioned response may depend on long-term learning (years of consumption) rather than short-term learning (frequency of coffee consumption per month). This result suggests that the shortened reaction time effect only occurs when the degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US is high.\nThe subjective arousal result did not coincide with the prediction that the greater the degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US, the greater the conditioned response would be. Many studies have shown that caffeine increases subjective arousal (Adan et al. 2008; Barmack 1940; Flaten et al. 2003; McLellan et al. 2016; Nehlig 2010; Peeling and Dawson 2007; Quinlan et al. 2000; Smit and Rogers 2000; Smith 2002). Moreover, some studies have found that caffeine-related stimuli increased subjective arousal (Adan et al. 2008; Flaten and Blumenthal 1999; Mikalsen et al. 2001). On the other hand, a previous study showed no significant difference in subjective arousal between the decaffeinated coffee and water groups (Fukuda and Aoyama 2017). Previous studies used a double-blind design (participants were not told that the drink was decaffeinated coffee). On the other hand, Fukuda and Aoyama (2017) and the present study used an open-label trial (either the participants knew the type of drink or they did not drink any beverage). Perhaps, since previous studies used a double-blind design, the expectancy effect of caffeine induced arousal in the participants.\nIn conclusion, the present study showed that the smell and sight of coffee (without tasting it) induced a conditioned response and the direction of this response was a caffeine-like effect. At least in behavioral effect, caffeine CS with any verbal information (including no information) uniformly induces a caffeine-like effect. Future study should investigate the effect of the smell \"or\" sight of coffee to determine the relationship between CS type and direction of response.\nMoreover, the present study is the first to investigate the relationship between years of coffee consumption (estimated degree of experience of the pairing of CS and US) and conditioned response. Previous studies have conducted experimental acquisition trials and have shown this relationship (caffeine study: Zwyghuizen-Doorenbos et al. 1990; alcohol study: Birak et al. 2011; Dafters and Anderson 1982). However, the present study suggests that longtime coffee drinkers may present a strong conditioned response to caffeine-related stimuli.\nTherefore, perhaps, decaffeinated coffee may also improve further performance in longtime coffee drinkers. Decaffeinated coffee could be effective for people who do not wish to ingest caffeine but still want a caffeine-like effect to improve performance. However, decaffeinated coffee could have a negative effect for people who do not wish to obtain a caffeine-like effect (e.g., loss of sleep) in the night.",

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is used to improve PAP adherence and no medication has been evaluated in such population yet. Melatonin with its chronobiotic and antioxidant effects may have potential benefits on COMISA consequences at the appropriate dose and time. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of melatonin on sleep quality, daytime sleepiness and PAP Compliance in patients with COMISA.\nBackground",
        "methodology": "Methods\nThis double-blind placebo trial randomly assigned eligible OSA patients who suffered from insomnia despite using PAP for over a month to receive either melatonin 10 mg or placebo. The primary outcomes were measured by changes in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10) over one month. Adherence to PAP was measured by the results of the PAP device reports on the average length of time and number of nights that the device was used.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and insomnia are highly prevalent sleep disorders, commonly present simultaneously. The prevalence of comorbid insomnia with obstructive sleep apnea (COMISA), has been estimated 10.7 to 88 percent due to variations in the population and diagnostic methods [1]. There is a bi-directional relationship between OSA and insomnia, which can describe this high prevalence [2]. Coexistence of two diseases, intensifies the burden of illness severity [3, 4]. Furthermore, insomnia and OSA share similar symptoms and risk factors. Patients experience decreased quality of life, mood disturbance, memory impairment, and daytime sleepiness, due to unrefreshing sleep and frequent awakening [5, 6]. Studies show that COMISA patients represent more sleep disturbance, cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetes [5, 7].\nSince OSA contributes to insomnia, treating it with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) devices, could improve persistent insomnia. However the pathophysiological mechanisms of the two conditions are different, and a distinct approach is needed to treat COMISA. It showed that people may still experience daytime sleepiness and low subjective sleep quality, overnight. Moreover, Patients have poor adherence to PAP devices as an effective treatment of moderate to severe OSA compared to the OSA alone, in the first six months of usage [8]. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), as a non-pharmacological treatment, was effective in patients with COMISA. Yet, improving sleep quality and increasing adherence to CPAP was not found in all of the patients and it was similar to the patients with insomnia alone [9-11].\nAlthough nonpharmacological therapies are preferred and more effective, in patients who have not been treated with CBTi or were reluctant to receive it, short-course of doxepin, Z-drugs, and benzodiazepines, are recommended. However, they were not effective enough to increase sleep efficiency [12, 13]. Therefore, alternative options can be considered.\nThe Pineal gland-secreted hormone, Melatonin, shows a soporific and chronobiotic effect and has sleep-promoting properties. It can probably be effective in primary and secondary sleep disorders. Reviews revealed that melatonin may increase sleep quality and decrease sleep latency, in primary insomnia [14, 15]. Although secondary insomnia seems to be more difficult to treat, it is found that melatonin usage improves total sleep time, in these patients [15].\nMelatonin has been used in comorbid insomnia, with various medical conditions [16]. Studies support this notion that either immediate or prolonged release of melatonin at the dose f 1-10 mg, not only can be prescribed safely, but also can improve sleep quality, sleep latency, and day- time sleepiness in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, respiratory disorders such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseas (COPD), and sulfur mustard lung injuries [17-25].\nAccording to studies, OSA and insomnia co-occurrence leads to more sleep complaints, than each of them alone. Besides, insomnia can exacerbate OSA and decrease PAP tolerance, and there is a lack of evidence in the selection of appropriate medication to improve sleep quality. Moreover, melatonin secretion alters in 25% of patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea in a way that the peak level of melatonin at night decreases significantly, and the phase- shifting occurs. Besides, melatonin is effective in primary and secondary insomnia, due to its chronobiotic effect. Based on clinical trials and reviews, melatonin can have benefits in sleep quality, sleep efficacy, and sleep latency, in chronic and comorbid insomnia without any negative effects on respiration [26]. we hypothesize that melatonin could be an appropriate alternative to improve the sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, in patients with COMISA. Therefore, in this study, the efficacy of immediate release of melatonin 10 mg on subjective sleep quality and PAP adherence in the COMISA population, was investigated.\nThe current study contributes to the state of knowledge both in terms of theory and practice, (a) The effect of melatonin in COMISA was an extrapolation of studies on chronic insomnia. There was a lack of evidence of pharmacotherapy in such population. Moreover, the dose of melatonin was much more than the usual doses used in chronic insomnia, since melatonin at a dose of more than 10 mg has a longer half-life in the blood. So, mid-night waking would be covered. (b) Instruments and questionnaires used in this study were clinically useful so that they can easily apply in sleep clinics to diagnose COMISA. (c) Participants were monitored for adverse effects during and after the intervention and the causality was evaluated by the Naranjo score.\nMethods\nParticipants\nPatients with baseline moderate-severe OSA (Apnea-hypopnea Index (AHI) [greater than or equal to]15), aged 18-75 years old, who were treated for OSA using a CPAP device for at least one month, and had insomnia complaints, were considered eligible. Insomnia was diagnosed by The International Classification of Sleep Disorders - Third Edition (ICSD-3) diagnostic criteria and ISI (Insomnia Severity Index) scale. Patients with ISI scores more than 15 or more than 6 in the first three questions, were also eligible.\nPSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) [greater than or equal to] 5 showed poor sleep quality and was considered as an inclusion criterion.\nAfter baseline assessment, the exclusion criteria were considered as following: severe pulmonary diseases (COPD GOLD IV, severe uncontrolled bronchiectasis, ILD, and asthma), severe heart diseases (NYHA class IV and uncontrolled hypertension), neurologic disorders (Parkinson disease and Alzheimer's disease beyond stage III based on Hoehn & Yahr stage scale and Global Deterioration Scale respectively), psychiatric disorders (using drugs, psychiatric disorders at least for 3 months, and bipolar disorder), using a medication affecting sleep and respiration (benzodiazepins, Z-drugs, neuroleptics), being allergic to melatonin, pregnancy and lactation, hypothyroidism, narcolepsy, restless leg syndrome, and being a shift worker. Besides, if the tablets were not taken for 4 days, the patient was excluded from the study.\nStudy design\nThis study was a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, conducted in the sleep clinic of Emam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran. The forthcoming clinical trial was carried out adhering to the standards of the International Conference on Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP), the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration 2013, the general guidelines for ethics in human subject research in the country, the ethical guidelines for clinical trials in the country, and other national and university laws and regulations. Informed consent form and all questionnaires provided to all participants has been accepted by Tehran University of medical sciences ethics committee and this committee authorized this study (IR.TUMS.TIPS.REC.1400.177). Registration number IRCT20220105053635N1 was issued by the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) on 19/04/2022.\nRandomization and blinding\nAfter the eligible participants enrolled in the study, they were randomly assigned to the melatonin or placebo group. Random numbers of envelopes were prepared by a separate staff, not involved in assigning and assessment of patients, using an online randomization generator (www.sealedenvelopes.com). Random four blocks were used. Opaque-sealed sequentially numbered envelopes were used for allocation concealment. The envelopes and the tablets were similar in terms of color, shape and size, so all the people including researchers and patients, were blinded through the study.\nStudy instruments\nA questionnaire was filled out at the time of enrollment, providing demographic information as follows: age, weight, height, BMI (Body Mass Index), marital status, education, job, PMH (Past Medical History which includes cardiovascular disorders, kidney diseases, pulmonary disorders, psychiatric disorders, and rheumatologic disorders), using medications associated with sleep disorders, baseline AHI, and duration of PAP therapy.\nInsomnia severity was assessed by the ISI scale. ISI is a seven-item questionnaire that assesses nighttime and daytime consequences due to insomnia, during the last two weeks. The scores for each question were added- up to get the final score. The categorization of patients for insomnia was based on the total score. A score below 7 showed no clinically significant insomnia, scores ranged from 8-14, represented subthreshold insomnia, and scores more than 15, were considered as moderate to severe insomnia. The first three questions assess difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, and problems waking up too early. An ISI score of more than 6 for these first three questions, can probably help diagnose co-morbid insomnia [1].\nSleep quality was assessed by PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) questionnaire. It is a self-reported instrument for the assessment of sleep quality and sleep disturbance in patients, over a one-month interval. This scale assesses 7 components: a)Total sleep quality, b) Sleep latency, c) sleep duration, d) sleep efficiency, e) sleep disturbance, f) use of sleep medications, and g) next morning dysfunction. The score of each component is ranged from 0 to 3. The total score resulted from adding the score of each component. A total PSQI score of more than 5, was eligible to enroll in the study.\nESS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) is a sleep test questionnaire that assesses daytime sleepiness, in eight daily situations. The ESS score of less than 7, shows no sleepiness. A score between 8-9 represents the average amount of daytime sleepiness. A score of more than 10, shows excessive daytime sleepiness.\nFOSQ-10 (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire) includes 10 questions presenting day -time dysfunction, resulting from insomnia in 10 different situations. It shows the effect of poor sleep quality on daily activities, memory, and concentration. The total score is ranged from 10 to 40. The FOSQ-10 score below 15, shows daily activity disturbance in patients. Besides, Higher scores represent better daily functions.\nAll Persian versions of the questionnaires were checked for validity and reliability [27-30].\nFor the assessment of adverse effects, a questionnaire was filled out, which was about the type of adverse effects (Headache, Confusion, Dizziness, Somnolence, Nausea, Fatigue), frequency, date of adverse effects happening, and time of recovery. The causality was assessed by the Naranjo score.\nTrial treatments\nPrior to this, participants were taught the principles of sleep hygiene. Following an initial assessment, eligible patients were asked to complete an informed consent form before being randomly assigned to either the placebo or melatonin group. Patients in the melatonin group received 10 mg melatonin tablets (produced by Jalinous company), 30- 60 minutes before sleep, for one month. Placebo tablets which were quite similar to the melatonin tablets in terms of color, shape, and taste, were given to the patients in the placebo group in the same order.\nIf a participant experienced poor sleep quality during the study despite receiving treatment appropriately, trazodone tablets were administered at a dose of 25-50mg. This was done to ensure ethical treatment of patients suffering from insomnia. The date, number of pills, and dose of trazodone usage were recorded. Although the data on Trazodone usage in obstructive sleep apnea is limited, studies and reviws showed that trazodone had no significant effect on Sleep Apnea Severity and Architecture include nadir oxygen saturation and duration of respiratory events. Moreover, trazodone at the dose of 100 mg could increase arousal thershold without impairing pharyngeal dilator muscle function and reduces the AHI. That is the resone of choosing trazodone in such patients.\nThe study's primary outcomes were improvements in sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, as assessed by four questionnaires: the ISI, PSQI, ESS, and FOSQ-10. Participants completed these questionnaires at both the baseline and the end of treatment [31, 32].\nThe study assessed adherence to PAP devices as a secondary outcome by measuring the number of days and hours patients used the device appropriately. This was defined as using the device for more than 4 hours and on at least 70% of days in the month prior to study enrollment. The data was extracted from reports generated by the PAP devices both at the baseline and at the end of the treatment.\nThe patients' medication and PAP device adherence, as well as their adherence to sleep hygiene principles, were re-evaluated after 15 days and at the end of the study. The same questionnaires were used to assess sleep quality, insomnia severity, daytime sleepiness, and impaired daily function.\nThe safety analyses included all patients who received therapy. Common adverse effects such as hypersensitivity reactions, headache, confusion, dizziness, somnolence, nausea and fatigue were evaluated during the study almost every 7 days and one month after the treatment was finished. The Naranjo score was used to evaluate causality for any adverse effects and the form was filled at the end of the treatment period. Patients with severe adverse effects were excluded. Unblinding would be performed for all patients if adverse effects occurred in more than 12.5% of participants (at least 7) or if they were caused by melatonin use. Serious adverse effects resulted in immediate unblinding for both the participants and the researchers.\nStatistical analysis\nSince there was lack of previous studies based on Iran in this population, the sample size was calculated according to other studies on comorbid insomnia and respiratory disorders [33], considering the error rate of 5%, power of 80%, [alpha]= 0.05 and [beta]= 0.9 and using the following formula, a 50-subject sample size (25 in each group) was consider for this study:[formula omitted]\nIBM SPSS version 27 was applied for statistical analysis. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were performed to examine the normality of distribution. Chi-square is performed to find out independency. Mean and standard deviations expressed continuous data and categorical data were represented by numbers and percentages. Independent sample t-test and Mann-Whitney was used to find out the differences between two arms, for normal and non-normal distribution data respectively and P-value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. The effect size was examined by Cohen's. One and two-way ANCOVA tests were performed to eliminate the covariates' effect.",
        "results": "Results\nThirty patients were enrolled in the study after randomization. The melatonin arm showed significant improvement in all four primary outcomes compared to the placebo arm. The PSQI score was 3.836[+ or -]1.839 in the melatonin arm versus 10.522[+ or -]3.626 in the placebo arm (Pvalue<0.001). The ISI score was 8.476[+ or -]3.568 in the melatonin arm versus 14.47[+ or -]4.50 in the placebo arm (Pvalue<0.001). The ESS score was 6.854[+ or -]4.334 in the melatonin arm versus 13.298[+ or -]5.119 in the placebo arm (Pvalue<0.001). The FOSQ-10 score was 24.93[+ or -]5.02 in the melatonin arm versus 19.87[+ or -]4.24 in the placebo arm (Pvalue= 0.006). Additionally, nighttime consequences such as sleep latency and awakenings showed significant improvement in the melatonin arm. PAP devices results revealed improvement in duration of PAP use overnight.\nResults\nAmong one hundred and twenty patients who underwent initial eligibility assessment, seventy patients were excluded due to not meeting the inclusion criteria. Thirty randomized participants completed the study. Figure 1 shows a flowchart of randomization and follow-up based on CONSORT 2010 guideline. Individuals were predominantly middle-aged (mean [SD] age, 58.53 [12.58], years) and female (70%). There was no significant difference in demographic features between two groups. The demographic characteristics of participants are presented in Table 1.\nFig. 1:\nFlow chart of Randomization and Follow-up of the Patients\nTable 1:\nCharacteristics of the patients at baseline\nPrimary outcomes\nResponse in the placebo vs. treatment group was evaluated by four questionnaire scores (PSQI, ESS, ISI, FOSQ-10). Meaningful improvements in primary outcomes were found in the melatonin arm, in comparison to the placebo arm (Table 2, Pvalue<0.001). Sleep quality measured by PSQI, demonstrates a significant difference pre- and post-intervention in the melatonin arm, in comparison to the placebo arm (2.481, [95% CI, 1.430 to 3.511] vs. 0.274, [95% CI, -.246 to 0.786], Pvalue<0.001). Moreover, the severity and impact of insomnia assessed by ISI, improved significantly in the melatonin group versus placebo (1.679,[95% CI, 0.870 to 2.464] vs. 0.550,[ 95% CI, -0.003 to 1.086], Pvalue<0.001). According to ISI scaling, patients in the melatonin arm were categorized as moderate to severe insomnia (mean[SD], total score, 15.93[+ or -]5.788), which was changed to subthreshold insomnia (mean[SD], total score, 8.476[+ or -]3.568), post-intervention. Whereas, in the placebo arm, patients suffered from severe insomnia (mean[SD], total score, 17.27[+ or -]5.77), which improved to moderate insomnia (mean[SD], total score, 14.47[+ or -]4.50).\nTable2:\nPrimary outcomes results\nDaytime sleepiness score also decreased in the melatonin group in comparison to placebo, due to ESS scale (1.743,[95% CI, 0.916 to 2.546] vs. 0.232,[95% CI, -0.285 to 0.741], Pvalue<0.001). Patients in both arms suffered from excessive daytime sleepiness (mean[SD], total score, melatonin arm, 11.93[+ or -]4.935 vs. mean[SD], total score, placebo arm, 13.87[+ or -]4.83). ESS total score improved significantly in the melatonin arm (mean[SD], total score, Pvalue, 6.854[+ or -]4.334 ,<0.001). whereas, daytime sleepiness had not significantly changed (mean[SD], total score, Pvalue, 13.29[+ or -]5.11, 0.05).\nCertain activities affected by daytime sleepiness, were evaluated by FOSQ-10 and improved in both groups. However, there was a significant difference between arms (-1.630,[CI 95%, -2.401 to -0.835] vs. -0.781[ CI 95%, -1.352 to -0.189] Pvalue= 0.006).\nSecondary outcomes\nPAP adherence was measured by the number of nights and hours of PAP usage, extracted from PAP devices. There were 25% and 51% increase in the number of patients using PAP device in the appropriate direction (more than 4 hours and 21 days respectively), in the melatonin arm. Whereas, in the placebo arm this increase in the number of patients were 10% and 33.3%, respectively (Fig. 2). According to the chi-square test, the number of nights using PAP devices was independent of medication use (Pvalue=0.068). Whereas, the duration of PAP use during the night, was significantly different between the two groups (P-value =0.032).\nFig. 2:\nPAP adherence: The data extracted from the PAP devices. Using the device for more than 4 hours during the night and 70% of the duration of the study is considered correct use. The diagram shows the percentage of participants who used PAP appropriately\nNight-time consequences such as sleep latency and midnight wake-up, showed improvements in the melatonin group according to the PSQI questionnaire (Fig. 3). About 33.3% of patients had less than 15 minutes of sleep latency, which improved to 93.3% of patients in the melatonin arm. However, the number of patients with sleep latency of less than 15 minutes, remained unchanged and 66% drop was seen between patients with more than one-hour sleep latency to 31-60 minutes sleep latency. The data was completely dependent on medication use, based on the chi-square test (Pvalue<0.001) which represented an improvement in the melatonin arm. Regarding midnight wake-ups, 86.6% of patients woke up more than three nights a week. After the intervention in the placebo arm, this number decreased to 60%. In the melatonin arm, the patients number decreased from 46% to 6.6% (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3:\nNight-time consequences (PSQI- questionnaire): The data extracted from PSQI- Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The diagrams represent the percentage of patients who had A)Mid-night wake-up B) time to sleep (sleep latency)\nAlthough AHI change was not significantly different between groups. However, AHI in the melatonin arm changed a bit more than placebo group, from the baseline (Pvalue = 0.018). There was no significant correlation between intervention and AHI changes (Pvalue= 0.683) (Table 3). The total sleep time increased for 8 minutes in the melatonin group. Whereas, this variable increased for about 17 minutes in the placebo group, which was not significantly different (Table 3).\nTable 3:\nSecondary outcomes results\nPatients who experienced poor sleep quality despite receiving medication during the study were given trazodone tablets at a dose of 25-50 mg, either in the melatonin or placebo group. During the study, six patients received trazodone 25 mg in the placebo group, and five of them received it for more than 12 days. In contrast, only two patients received trazodone in the melatonin group, and for less than five days, particularly in the initial days. According to ANCOVA tests, the usage and medication treatment of Trazodone did not significantly affect total sleep time, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness based on PSQI and ESS (Pvalue>0.001). However, it did have an effect on the FOSQ-10 result in the placebo group. The statistics showed no significant difference in the placebo group from baseline in the absence of Trazodone.\nSafety profile\nRegarding adverse effects, follow-up assessments were conducted at 15-day and one-month intervals after the study's completion. If there were any adverse effects, the casualty was assessed by Naranjo score and then documented. During this study, melatonin showed no adverse effects such as drowsiness, headache, fatigue, confusion, or nausea. Daytime sleepiness was not affected by melatonin use.",
        "discussion": "Discussion and conclusion\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate a pharmacologic option at an appropriate dose, 10 mg melatonin, on patients suffering from COMISA who were using PAP devices due to OSA, over a period of one month. Sleep quality, daytime functioning and adherence to PAP therapy were assessed in this randomized double- blind placebo-controlled trial.. According to the results of this clinical trial, a dose of 10 mg of melatonin can improve sleep latency, reduce mid-night wake-ups, and enhance subjective sleep quality, insomnia, and sleep efficiency in COMISA patients, without significantly changing total sleep time compared to the placebo. Moreover, duration of PAP device use was increased based on PAP devices reports which means that adherence to PAP device improved and AHI in melatonin group has significantly changed from the baseline.\nNumerous mechanisms can explain the bidirectional relationship between OSA and insomnia. Repetitive respiratory obstructive events and sympathetic activation lead to frequent microarousals, sleep fragmentation and prolonged wakefulness. In addition, nocturia as a consequence of obstructive sleep apnea, results multiple awakenings and difficulty maintaining sleep [34, 35]. On the other hand, insomnia may exacerbate complications of obstructive sleep apnea due to maintaining in bed to prevent refreshment because of awakenings or low arousal threshold. In terms of hormonal release alteration, melatonin nocturnal peak is delayed and shifted to early morning in patients suffering from OSA [36]. In addition, advancing age leads to decrease in melatonin secretion and sleep efficiency. So that, insomnia complications are common in older patients with obstructive sleep apnea [37, 38]. It becomes more complicated if the patients use PAP devices. Positive airway pressure will cause physical discomfort and may be intolerable. As a result, patient compliance with PAP therapy decreases leading to OSA treatment failure, daytime hypersomnolence, poor daytime performance and various comorbidities in long term. Finding an appropriate pharmacological therapy for these patients will be critical improving PAP compliance and sleep quality. According to results of this study, melatonin at the appropriate dose and time, is a safe choice.\nIt is worthy to compare these results with a parallel group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot effectiveness clinical trial performed by Gooneratne et al. In this study, the efficacy of ramelteon, a melatonin agonist medication, on polysomnographic parameters was considered in elderly patients with COMISA. Twenty-one patients with AHI[greater than or equal to]5 received 8 mg ramelteon for four weeks and polysomnography was performed at the initiation and the end of the intervention. This study concluded that ramelteon improve objective sleep quality in patients receiving APAP and suffering from COMISA [39]. Another study about agomelatine, has revealed effectiveness of agomelatine on total sleep time, sleep efficiency and percentage of patients' awakening in the obstructive sleep apnea population [40]. All of these results showed that melatonin and melatonin- based medications may have positive effect on sleep quality with lowest adverse effects in OSA population.\nThe efficacy of melatonin on comorbid insomnia and other respiratory diseases such as COPD, was assessed in previous studies. Researches showed that 3mg of melatonin could improve subjective sleep quality based on PSQI among these patients. A recent study suggested that melatonin could be an alternative to benzodiazepines for patients suffering from insomnia and COPD [41]. Various clinical trials have investigated the effects of different pharmacotherapy approaches on obstructive sleep apnea. It may be worth considering the short-term use of low-dose doxepin (3-6 mg) and Z-drugs [12]. Sedative-hypnotics, such as eszopiclone, may be used in specific OSA patients with a low to moderate arousal threshold and no significant overnight oxygen desaturation. Furthermore, administering high doses of medications, such as zolpidem, in severe cases of OSA may prolong respiratory events and decrease oxygen levels during the night. However, several studies have shown that sedative-hypnotics do not improve sleep efficiency in patients with OSA [13].\nAs far as adverse effects are concerned, there was not enough data on melatonin's adverse effects in long term. However, recent studies demonstrate that exogenous melatonin at the dose of 10 mg or more, does not increase serious adverse effects [42-44]. Whereas, other adverse effects such as headaches, especially in the first two days, may occur more [45], so it can be safely administered to the elderly [46]. In the present study, the adverse effects were monitored closely, during and one month after the intervention. The causality was evaluated by the Naranjo score scale. According to the data, no side effects related to melatonin use ,were seen during and after the study.\nIn conclusion, Melatonin can be a great option in COMISA patients, as it improves sleep quality and increases PAP adherence in this population, without any serious adverse effects. These findings emphasize the importance of considering melatonin as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for patients with COMISA. Further research is necessary to evaluate long-term effects or basic studies should be conducted to find out the mechanism of melatonin in such population. Nonetheless, melatonin represents a valuable tool in improving the sleep quality and overall well-being of individuals with COMISA.\nLimitations\n* As the overall prevalence of COMISA is low and the price of PAP devices increased throughout the study, the population was restricted. Despite not reaching the total sample size calculated at the initiation of the study due to some limitations, the sample power was more than 90% for primary outcomes\n* PAP device reports demonstrate mean nighttime PAP use by hours and number of nights, during a month. So, the exact time of sleep and wake-ups were not measured. In order to find out the duration of sleep, polysomnography could be applied before and after the intervention.\n* Even though some patients needed to take other hypnotics during the study, the results showed that using hypnotics does not affect the total sleep time and sleep quality, in both groups.\nAbbreviations: AHI: Apnea- Hypopnea Index; ANCOVA: Analysis of Covariance; BMI: Body Mass Index; COMISA: Comorbid Insomnia and Obstructive Sleep Apnea; COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; ESS: Epworth sleepiness scale; FOSQ-10: Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10); GOLD: Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; ICSD-3: The International Classification of Sleep Disorders - Third Edition; ILD: Interstitial lung diseases; IRCT: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials; ISI: Insomnia Severity Index; NYHA: The New York Heart Association; OSA: Obstructive Sleep Apnea; PAP: Positive Airway Pressure; PMH: Past Medical History; PSQI: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index\nAcknowledgments: Special thanks to the investigators, the staff working in the sleep clinic of Emam Khomeini Hospital, Dr. Hooman Bakhshandeh for his recommendations on statistical issues and also patients, for their collaboration.\nCorrespondence:\nAuthor details: 1https://ror.org/01c4pz451, grid.411705.6, 0000 0001 0166 0922, Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, , 1417614411, Tehran, Iran. 2https://ror.org/01c4pz451, grid.411705.6, 0000 0001 0166 0922, Research Center for Rational Use of Drugs, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, , 1417614411, Tehran, Iran. 3https://ror.org/01c4pz451, grid.411705.6, 0000 0001 0166 0922, Advanced Thoracic Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, , Tehran, Iran. 4Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical and Research Institute, , 1995614331, Tehran, Iran.",

        "introduction": "Background\nCognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is one of the most successful therapeutic approaches for treating anxiety and depression. Clinical trials show that for some clients, internet-based CBT (eCBT) is as effective as other CBT delivery modes. However, the fidelity of these effects may be weakened in real-world settings where clients and providers have the freedom to choose a CBT delivery mode and switch treatments at any time. The purpose of this study is to measure the CBT attendance rate and identify client-level characteristics associated with delivery mode selection and having reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI) of treatment in each delivery mode in a real-world CBT outpatient program.\nIntroduction and background",
        "methodology": "Methods\nThis is a retrospective cohort analysis of electronic medical records collected between May 1, 2019, and March 31, 2022, at Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences. Regression models were used to investigate the impact of individual client characteristics on participation and achieving RCSI of different CBT delivery modes.\nAnxiety and depression are two common mental health conditions that have been successfully treated using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a widely used therapeutic method. The research literature has established the effectiveness of several CBT delivery methods, including individual, group, and internet-based therapy with coaching [1-4]. There is evidence that CBT is an effective treatment for variety of mental disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder [5], depression [6], panic disorder [7]. There is also strong evidence that suggests internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (eCBT) is equally as effective as individual treatment for depression [3, 8] and anxiety [9]. The Internet is a good way to spread preventive measures because the units of delivery are cheaper and easy to use [10]. eCBT has become an important modality during the COVID-19 pandemic as access to individual treatment is limited. Understanding the challenges in delivering different CBT modalities will be essential for improving depression and anxiety treatments and implementation of stratified care in specialized mental health centres.\nThe use of CBT therapies in real-world settings requires further study because a large portion of this evidence relies on controlled experimental settings. The main drawback of these clinical trials is that the implementation of the interventions typically involves a high degree of fidelity to recommended practises and client adherence. This level of fidelity and adherence is likely to be lower in real-world contexts and less is known on what client characteristics are associated with entering therapy modalities and which client variables are connected with completing treatment [11-13].\nPast empirical studies assessed CBT initiation and dropout rates using variety of client related factors, yet they have limited agreement on the strength of the evidence for these factors. As discussed by El Alaoui et al. [5], this may be the result of a variety of factors, including variations in dropout definition, sample size and features, and statistical techniques for analysing the prognostic significance of baseline variables. This study assesses the relationship between client characteristics on participation in and completion of treatment in different CBT modalities (eCBT, group, individual, mixed) to identify factors that may influence client success in different CBT modalities. The aim is to identify opportunities for further optimization of treatment assignment.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy setting\nThis study used retrospective cohort design, and administrative data were taken from the electronic medical records (EMRs) at Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences in Ontario, Canada. Ontario Shores is a specialized mental health hospital in Ontario, Canada that serves a regional population of 2.8 million people. The hospital has 18 care units, 346 inpatient beds, and has over 94,000 outpatient visits annually. The proposed research will support the evaluation and continuous improvement of a multi-modal CBT program at Ontario Shores. Interventions in this program are provided by more than 30 clinicians (social workers, nurses, occupational therapists, and psychologists) across 30 sites.\nOntario Shores Anxiety and Mood Program (AMD) offers individual, group, eCBT (or internet-based CBT with coaching) and mixed modality that is a combination of two or three of these modalities offered to the patient. Individual therapy comprises 60-minute face-to-face structured psychotherapy sessions with a dedicated therapist. Group therapy involves in-person structured psychotherapy led by a single therapist and attended by two or more clients. To address mild to moderate depression and anxiety, Ontario Shores introduced eCBT on May 1, 2019. This modality incorporates coaching sessions, self-help learning modules, informational resources, and assigned homework to reinforce key concepts and impart mental health skills. Clients participating in eCBT, akin to other modalities, have the option to complete assessments throughout the program to monitor progress and enhancements. Aligned with the BC-CBT framework, this therapeutic approach seamlessly integrates in-person sessions with digital and online components for a comprehensive and flexible treatment experience.\nModality selection is determined by a client's diagnosis, symptoms, and personal preferences. Based on the shared decision-making principals, mental healthcare providers will discuss the different potential treatment options with the client and come to an agreement on the best modality.\nData\nClinical staff members gathered and entered outpatient data inputted into the EMRs (a system called Meditech) at each client interaction. The outpatient records were collected for clients with an initial pre-session evaluation and at least one session of individual, group, or eCBT offered by Ontario Shores. The study utilised data acquired between May 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021, with a one-year follow-up through March 31, 2022, to assess the treatment completion of all clients. We looked back two years to ensure that the first client encounter had been included. For all clients, the first encounter date is the date of their initial pre-session evaluation prior to starting CBT treatment. The EMR data included demographic information from individuals who received eCBT, group CBT, individual CBT, or a combination of these treatments, as well as information from Integrated Community Access Program (ICAP) clinics that provide psychotherapy and medication for individuals with anxiety and mood disorders. At the time of data collection, our exclusion criteria were limited to 31 records pertaining to 5 distinct individuals for whom a confidential flag had been applied. Furthermore, we did not have access to data on services provided by the Ontario Structured Psychotherapy Program, which is a parallel dissemination of CBT occurring in the province during this period with unique treatment and data acquisition protocols.\nOutcome measures\nOutcome measures included CBT modality selection (i.e., individual, group, eCBT, mixed) and reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI) in symptoms of anxiety and depression from baseline to end of follow-up. In practice, healthcare providers will choose the best available modality and advise patients, accordingly, taking the client's diagnosis and symptoms into consideration. Symptoms of anxiety were measured using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale [14]. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 9-Question Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [15]. Both measures have been validated previously and are commonly employed in clinical settings [16, 17]. The RCSI has been calculated by data and analytics professionals to support treatment planning and routine outcome monitoring inside the Ontario Shores Hospital. In the context of the CBT program, RCSI was defined as a shift in PHQ-9 of > = 6 points from baseline to final scores at the treatment's conclusion, with an initial PHQ-9 score of > = 10. Similarly, GAD-7 changes > = 5 points from baseline to final scores at the end of treatment, where the first GAD-7 score was > = 8, signifying successful treatment [18, 19].\nData preparation\nOur primary sample included 16,510 sessions for 1,098 unique client records who received CBT sessions in the Ontario Shores Mood and Anxiety clinics during the study period. In total, 6,864 electronic CBT, 3,996 group CBT, and 8,808 individual CBT sessions have been provided. All our sample started treatment and 97% completed two or more sessions.\nData management steps included excluding part of independent variables with more than 20% missing information. The decision to exclude variables with high percentages of missing information was primarily driven by the acknowledgment of poor data quality in out-patient databases. Imputing or attempting to fill in missing values for these variables might lead to biased or unreliable results, and therefore, it was deemed more appropriate to remove them from the list of variables considered for analysis. The variables retained in the analysis have undergone this careful data management process to enhance the overall validity of our research findings. We excluded sociodemographic characteristics with high percentage of missing information, such as education (98% missing) and racial identity (29% missing) as well as clinical variables such as primary diagnoses (28% missing) and secondary diagnoses (40% missing). For variables with low levels of missing data, including living arrangement (1%), employment status (6%), Canadian Index of Multiple Deprivation (CIMD) (5%), baseline GAD-7 (6%), and baseline PHQ-9 (less than 1%), we opted for Multiple Imputation (MI). This approach addresses missing values statistically, enhancing the completeness of the dataset and ensuring robustness in subsequent analyses. The MI process involved generating substitute values tailored to the type of each independent variable. In the end, no observations were dropped due to missing data.\nSpecifically, Bayesian linear regression was applied for continuous variables such as baseline client outcomes, logistic regression for dichotomous variables like living and employment status, and Polytomous logistic regression for categorical variables such as neighborhood deprivation. This approach ensured a comprehensive imputation strategy considering the diverse nature of the dataset's variables. We utilized RStudio's \"mice\" function within the \"mice\" package to implement MI.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were performed to compile client variables relevant to each CBT modality that were obtained from the client's screening (i.e., age, sex, employment, and living status).\nWe estimated a multinomial logit regression for n = 1,098 clients to determine what client characteristics are related to entering each therapy modalities (Individual, group, eCBT, and mixed). We chose eCBT as the basis category due to its higher frequency. Using \"multinom\" function from \"nnet\" RStudio package, we modelled modality choice as a function of client age (adults between the ages of 17-70), sex at birth (male or female), living situation (alone or in a household), employment situation (employed or unemployed), Canadian Index of Multiple Deprivation (in five quantiles), baseline GAD-7, and baseline PHQ-9. The CIMD is a composite index that assesses various dimensions of deprivation and socioeconomic well-being across different geographic areas in Canada. Developed by Statistics Canada, the CIMD integrates multiple indicators related to income, education, employment, housing, and living conditions [20] to provide a comprehensive measure of deprivation. The index assigns quantitative scores to geographic areas based on the levels of deprivation observed. Higher scores indicate higher levels of deprivation, while lower scores suggest better socioeconomic conditions.\nTo answer our second research question on the predictors of having RCSI, we estimated a logistic regression model using \"glm\" function for post-treatment RSCI outcome in the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 measures. The outcomes were modelled as a function of CBT modality (Individual, group, eCBT, and mixed), age (adults between the ages of 17 and 70), sex at birth (male or female), living situation (alone or with others), employment situation (employed or unemployed), CIMD deprivation Index (in five quantiles), and baseline GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores.\nThe choice of the methodology from authors was based on the nature of our data. We did not consider longitudinal models as all patient characteristics were collected at admission to the CBT program, and most were time-invariant. We collected GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores longitudinally to calculate the RCSI outcome. However, many clients received only two measurements over their length-of-stay - typically at admission at end-of-treatment. Thus, we had limited ability to capture and analyze changes or over time.\nOne additional question regarding the data was whether the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the outcomes. Using a sample of 116 people who participated in each of the 4 modalities, we performed a sensitivity analysis to count for any demographic variations in comparison to the larger sample to verify this matter (details in the appendix section). Our research cannot establish causality; its findings are primarily descriptive. Given this is an observational study, our results should not be interpreted causally due to unobserved confounding.\nThis study is limited to a single hospital in Ontario, Canada, and the results may not be applicable to other settings. Ontario Shores offers a variety of CBT treatment alternatives for patients diagnosed with depression and anxiety, including eCBT from May 2019 that made the treatment more accessible and less expensive since the onset of COVID-19. Based on our original findings, eCBT appears to be effective for a specific population, and there may be a case for expanding its use. It is important to note that this is a real-world intervention implemented in an uncontrolled clinical setting, the collection of assessment data was not always consistent. Thus, we used the last available scores for each client to assess RCSI prior to patients leaving the program. The one-year follow-up allowed us to follow all clients from admission to the end of their treatment as clients had variable treatment duration and they may have achieved RCSI prior to their final assessment and that the goal is not to assess long term sustained remission of the condition, but only the state of symptoms at the end of treatment.",
        "results": "Results\nOur data show a high attendance rate for two and more CBT sessions across all modalities (98% of electronic, 94% of group, 100% of individual, and 99% of mixed CBT). Individuals were more likely to enter mixed and group CBT modality if they were younger, reported being employed, and reported higher depression severity at the baseline. Among the four modalities of CBT delivery, group CBT clients were least likely to have RCSI. Of those who started sessions, clients were significantly more likely to experience RCSI on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 if they were employed, reported more severe symptoms at baseline, and were living in the most deprived neighborhoods.\nResults\nBaseline data\nTable 1 shows descriptive statistics for clients receiving electronic (n = 563), group (n = 143), individual (n = 256), and mixed CBT (n = 136). The findings are based on the completed (n = 711) imputed data (n = 387) for all 1,098 clients receiving CBT at Ontario Shores between May 1, 2019, and March 31, 2022. The analysis of baseline PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores reveals a consistent pattern across most Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) modalities. However, an exception is observed in the case of eCBT. In the eCBT group, the average baseline GAD-7 score was 12 (SD = 5.1), compared to an average of 14 in the other groups (F-statistic = 9.209, p = 5.55e-06. This places the average score within the category of 'Moderate anxiety' (10-14 range) according to the GAD-7 scoring guidelines [14]. In the eCBT group, the average baseline PHQ-9 score was 13 (SD = 5.8), compared to an average of 16 to 18 in the other groups (F-statistic = 25.45, p = 1.21e-15) This information suggests that individuals participating in or being assigned to eCBT may, on average, exhibit more moderate levels of depression compared to counterparts in other CBT modalities.\nTable 1:\nBaseline data on selected demographics of patients who received CBT at Ontario Shores between 2019 and 2022\nAmong all modalities, clients undergoing individual CBT exhibited the highest attendance rate averaging 25 sessions. Clients on average were young females living with others in a moderate socioeconomically deprived neighborhood (Q2 and Q3). They were mostly unemployed, and they had moderate anxiety (10-14 GAD-7 scores risk level) and moderately severe depression (15-19 PHQ-9 scores risk level) on average, with the eCBT cohort scoring the lowest symptom severity. At the end of treatment, more than half of the clients have attained RCSI (56% individual CBT, followed by 55% group, 53% electronic, and 51% mixed CBT).\nMultinomial regression findings\nTo answer our first research question on the characteristics associated with entering each CBT modality, we developed a multinomial logistic regression with modality type as the dependent variable. Table 2 displays coefficient results of each CBT modality in comparison to our baseline modality which is eCBT. Employment was associated with lower probability of receiving individual CBT (OR = 0.49, 95% CI [0.35-0.68]), mixed CBT (OR = 0.5, 95% CI [0.33-0.75]), and group CBT (OR = 0.64, 95% CI [0.44-0.95]). Older age was a predictor of entering into the mixed modality (OR = 1.02, 95% CI [1.01-1.04]) and group CBT (OR = 1.02, 95% CI [1.00-1.03]) versus eCBT. Although the results of CIMD neighborhood deprivation index were inconsistent, living in the fifth quantile (Q5), which identifies the most deprived neighborhood [20], was associated with participation in mixed CBT (OR = 2.24, 95% CI [1.08-4.63]). Compared to eCBT, the severity of the client's depressive symptoms at baseline was a positive predictor of receiving individual (OR = 1.15, 95% CI [1.11-1.20]), mixed (OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.03-1.13]), and group CBT (OR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.02-1.11]).\nTable 2:\nResults of modeling multinomial regression analysis of entering treatment for each modality versus eCBT\nLogistic regression findings on reliable improvement outcome\nTable 3 shows the results of a logistic regression analysis on the post-treatment RCSI outcome. From our sets of demographic variables employment (OR = 1.35, 95% CI [1.03-1.77]) was significant in predicting treatment success in terms of having RCSI. As expected, both baseline PHQ-9 (OR = 1.11, 95% CI [1.07-1.15]) and GAD-7 (OR = 1.07, 95% CI [1.04-1.11]) are significantly associated with RCSI. Regarding the modality type, participating in individual (OR = 0.69, 95% CI [0.49-0.98]) and mixed CBT (OR = 0.67, 95% CI [0.44-1.01]) modalities decreased the probabilities of having RCSI relative to eCBT. Despite the inconsistency of the CIMD quantile results, living in the most deprived neighborhood (Q5) (OR = 0.60, 95% CI [0.38-0.94]) decreased the likelihood of having post-treatment RCSI.\nTable 3:\nLogistic regression results of the post-treatment RCSI",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between client-level characteristics and participation in different CBT modalities. Furthermore, we examine the predictors of CBT post-treatment RCSI using a retrospective cohort design. In line with previous studies such as Luo et al. (2020) [22], our findings revealed that electronic CBT, along with the other three modes of CBT delivery, had a high attendance rate (showing low early dropout rates), with approximately 80% of clients completing at least six sessions or more. Post-treatment RCSI of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 was present in about 50% of the CBT attendees. Our adjusted findings show lower relative odds of RCSI in more traditional therapy options (individual, group) compared to eCBT, and absolute (unadjusted) differences in probability of RCSI was similar across modalities (from 53% in eCBT to 56% in individual). A notable initial finding reveals a significant variation in the average number of sessions across different modalities, spanning from 9 sessions for eCBT to 25 sessions for individual CBT. It is important to note that while eCBT can be effective for many individuals, it may not be suitable for everyone. Certain conditions or personal circumstances may require the support and guidance of a therapist in a traditional therapy setting. The consultation with a mental health professional can determine the most appropriate form of therapy for client's specific needs.\nThere is a large body of literature on CBT treatment initiation or dropout prediction [23-26] that focuses on dropout rates based on demographic and clinical variables. This study adds to this literature by investigating the individual-level predictors of treatment across a variety of CBT delivery modes to inform program planning. While our findings are descriptive, they suggest that clients with higher baseline PHQ-9 scores (indicating more severe symptoms) are referred to more intensive CBT (e.g., individual, group and mixed). Despite the importance of baseline GAD-7 scores, they were not independently important and associated with treatment modality when adjusting for PHQ-9. There are few differences in other client characteristics across the four treatment modalities. Though, one finding that merits further investigation is that being employed increased the likelihood of receiving eCBT for depression and anxiety disorders. Older clients were also more likely to receive mixed and group CBT therapy.\nOur study on the Ontario Shores CBT program highlights the significance of considering clients' socio-demographic variables, such as employment status, when assessing the success rates of CBT treatment across different modalities. Incorporating predictive algorithms based on sociodemographic factors can offer valuable insights for making informed decisions regarding the appropriate type of psychotherapy treatment for clients.\nRegarding modality type, our findings indicate that clients with more severe symptoms are referred into higher intensity CBT and are less likely to respond to treatment. This suggest that there is opportunity to look to other treatments in cases of non-response. In this population, eCBT was at least as effective as more conventional therapies. While this is descriptive, it may imply that there are additional opportunities to optimize care by referring more clients to eCBT given it is less resource intensive.\nStudy limitation\nIn our study, certain limitations must be addressed. Firstly, we encountered data quality issues for this study and were unable to work with a broader range of important patient and treatment related variables; consequently, four independent variables were eliminated from our analysis. Secondly, the exclusion of individuals with confidential EMRs was necessary to safeguard requested privacy. Additionally, at the time of data pooling, the unique treatment and data acquisition protocols of OSP led to its exclusion.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusions\nThis study will contribute to the body of knowledge about the implementation and treatment planning of different CBT delivery modes in real-world settings. With the changing clinical environment, it is possible to advocate for the adoption of the eCBT intervention to improve therapy practices and achieve better treatment success. The findings can help guide future CBT program planning based on client socio-demographic characteristics, allowing the optimal therapy type to be targeted to the right client at the right time.\nKeywords: Cognitive behaviour therapy, Modality, Deprivation index, Reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI), Administrative data, Anxiety, Depression\nAuthor(s): Afsaneh Roshanghalb1,2 , Bojay Hansen2 , David Rudoler1,2 and Michael W Best2,3\nConclusions\nThe results indicate that there is a room for optimization of the selection process regards to different CBT types for clients admitted with depression and anxiety disorders. Baseline symptoms of depression is an important predictor of treatment success and modality selection. However, those who receive eCBT are more likely to see reliable improvement in their symptoms. This might suggest opportunity to use baseline client characteristics as a predictor of optimal treatment selection. Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of the results and incorporate a broader range of clinical and individual factors, such as client medications, diagnosis, and preferences, into models that shape practitioners' program recommendations and predict the outcomes of the entrance and modality options.\nAbbreviations: CBT: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy; EMRs: Electronic Medical Records; ICAP: Integrated Community Access Program; RCSI: Post-treatment Reliable and Clinically Significant Improvement in the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 measures; LOS: length of stay; MI: Multiple Imputation; CIMD: Canadian Index of Multiple Deprivation; eCBT: Internet-based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy; UP: Unified protocol; PHQ-9: 9 items Patient Health Questionnaire; GAD-7: 7 items General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire\nAcknowledgements: Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences (Ontario Shores) is a public teaching hospital providing a range of specialized assessment and treatment services to those living with complex and serious mental illness like depression and anxiety.

        "introduction": "Background\nEven though there is an increasing amount of evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies to suggest that pathological inner speech plays a role in the emergence of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), studies investigating the mechanisms underlying this relationship are rather scarce. Examining moderators might inform the development of new treatment options for AVH. We sought to extend the existing knowledge by testing the moderating role of cognitive impairment in the association between inner speech and hallucinations in a sample of Lebanese patients with schizophrenia.\nBackground\nEven though schizophrenia has been recognized as a disease for over a century, its etiology and pathophysiology remain uncertain [1]. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders DSM-5, schizophrenia is characterized by abnormalities in one or more of the following five domains: hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking or speech, grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior, and negative symptoms [2]. Positive symptoms are the quickest to detect, and the reason behind the term \"positive\" is that the abnormality resides in their additional presence [3]. Positive symptoms include delusions and hallucinations which are cornerstones of psychosis; they are prominent because they are severe, frequent, and are the primary target of schizophrenia pharmacotherapies [4]. Hallucinations can happen in every sensory modality, although auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are the most prevalent [5], affecting two thirds of people diagnosed with schizophrenia [6]. AVH refer to subjective perceptual experiences of voices occurring in the absence of external stimuli. Because the voices are characterized by a negative emotional content (e.g., criticize/threaten the patient or command them to behave against their desires), AVH may be quite distressing [7]. In addition, hallucinations may negatively affect interpersonal functioning and even lead to dangerous behaviors [8]. Besides, AVH are sometimes associated with drug resistance in patients with schizophrenia [9]. Despite this, the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying AVHs require more investigation. Therefore, it is important to understand how AVH emerge to be able to enhance the effective, theoretically-based psychological interventions (e.g. CBT for psychosis) [10]. In this regard, we focus in the present work on the pathway leading from inner speech to AVH.\nThe relationship between inner speech and AVH\nInner speech is the egocentric use of language while omitting overt and perceptual articulation [11]. It has been suggested that AVH may emerge from inner speech misattribution to external (non-self) sources [12, 13]. This could be caused by schizophrenia patients' defective auditory cortical reactivity to inner speech, and may lead to a misidentification of inner speech as external voices [14]. The auditory pathway's activation determines how internal and external speech are localized in space. Therefore, malfunction of this circuit may lead to an outer spatial perception of the inner voice which can explain the outside-the-head interpretation of the inner voice that arises in AVH [15], even though some voice-hearers perceive their voices as occurring inside their head which may be regarded as a form of inner speech [16]. Patients with schizophrenia experiencing delusions have also been shown to have challenges in self-monitoring their speech [17] and are as well prone to experience external misattributions [18]. Hence the importance of adjusting for delusions when examining the relationship between inner speech and AVH.\nPrevious research revealed a relationship between particular inner speech features and an increased tendency for auditory hallucinations. The dialogic component and other people in inner speech related more strongly to auditory hallucination tendency than other factors [19]. Besides, individuals with psychosis experienced high levels of evaluative inner speech, which also positively correlated with the severity of AVH [20]. Even though there is an increasing amount of evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies to suggest that pathological inner speech plays a role in the emergence of AVH [21-23], studies investigating the mediators/moderators underlying this relationship are rather scarce. In order to further understand the interrelations between inner speech and AVH, we examined the moderating effect of an important construct that has been related to the development and experience of AVH, cognitive impairment [24, 25]. A moderator is a variable that affects either the direction or the strength of the association between an independent variable (here, inner speech) and an outcome variable (AVH, in this study) [26]. Examining moderators is thus necessary as it may impact the association between inner speech and the development of AVH and might as well inform the development of new treatment options for AVH.\nCognitive impairment as moderator in the relationship between inner speech and AVH\nCognitive impairment seems to be a possible factor moderating the cross-sectional relationship from inner speech to AVH, being especially linked to both variables. Impaired cognitive performance seems to be a central characteristic of schizophrenia, with 70-80% of patients presenting cognitive impairments in the form of significant general intellectual impairment and executive functioning problems [27]. Previous research has demonstrated that cognitive deficits may predispose people to psychiatric disorders, could serve as an early indicator of future illness, and predict the disease prognosis [28]. More particularly, a variety of hallucinatory cognitive mechanisms such as verbal memory and language processing have been hypothesized [29]. It is proposed that hallucinations are caused by a failure in self-recognition due to deficiencies in source-monitoring mechanisms, which lead mental events to be misattributed to external sources [25]. These often involve processes that assess memory recordings in order to form a concise overview of an event [30]. Therefore, cognitive impairment, including working memory deficits, may predict AVHs and could contribute to their emergence [24].\nOn the other hand, there is evidence that inner speech is closely linked to cognitive function. Inner speech supports executive functioning related to task switching performance [31], and is considered to play some role in mediating short-term/working memory [32]. Besides, inner speech disturbances may affect socio-emotional functioning, and general cognitive processing such as silent remembering, reading, writing [33], planning, behavioral control, inhibition, cognitive flexibility [11], and attentional improvement [34]. Cognitive impairment can affect the underlying cognitive processes normally involved in inner speech self-monitoring [17], leading to uncontrolled inner speech that can result in inner speech-based AVH [35]. It is also proposed that certain executive function deficiencies are what leads to unregulated inner speech, and when inner speech is uncontrolled, as it is frequently used in executive function activities, it will result in additional cognitive issues [36].\nThe present study\nWhile a deficit in inner speech has been one of the most popular cognitive theories about the cause of AVH [25], there is a lack of evidence on the nature of this association. Therefore, it becomes evident that further investigating pathways between inner speech and AVH is strongly needed. To our knowledge, the only studied pattern was the mediating effect of dissociation between varieties of inner speech (other people and evaluative) and hallucination proneness [37]. Furthermore, although inner speech is a commonly experienced phenomenon in daily life, it is still poorly understood. People perceive inner speech regardless of their language and culture [33]; however speech cannot exist outside the framework of interpersonal and sociocultural interactions. The core evolution of the human being occurs in a social context, moving from the social to the individual [38]. Besides, culture influences a person with voice-hearing experiences and clinical repercussions might result from these variations [39]. Hence the importance of this study which is the first to research inner speech in an Arabic-speaking population from a Middle East country, Lebanon. In the present study, we sought to extend the existing knowledge by testing the moderating effect of cognitive impairment in the association between inner speech and hallucinations in Lebanese patients with schizophrenia. We propose that cognitive impairment enhances the cross-sectional positive correlation between particular inner speech types and AVH in these patients.",
        "methodology": "Methods\nA cross-sectional study was conducted from May till August 2022, enrolling 189 chronic patients.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nA cross-sectional study was conducted between May and August 2022, at the Psychiatric Hospital of the Cross, Lebanon, recruiting 207 randomly selected in-patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Patients who were aged 18 or older, cognitively able to fill a questionnaire, and classified as having chronic schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, Fifth Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) were eligible to participate. Patients with any other diagnosis, and those who refused to participate were excluded from the study. As a result, 18 of the 207 individuals recruited were eliminated, leaving 189 patients to compose our sample (Fig. 1). Data was collected through performing personal face-to-face structured interviews with the participating subjects. Interviews were conducted after obtaining the signed consent form. Only participants who were able to provide consent were included in the study. Those who were unable to do so (8 participants) due to severe cognitive impairment or psychopathology were excluded to not affect the reliability or validity of our assessments.\nFig. 1:\nFlow chart of enrollment of patients in the study\nMeasures\nThe questionnaire was in Arabic, the native language of the country, and took around 20 min to complete. The first section was filled out using the patients' medical files, and it assessed the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients. These include age, sex, marital status, education level, income, duration of hospitalization, duration of schizophrenia illness and family history of psychiatric illness, along with the socio-economic status of the patients, which was categorized as low (< 200 USD), intermediate (200-500 USD), or high (> 500 USD) based on the patient's caregivers' monthly income.\nThe following scales were included in the second section of the questionnaire, which was completed during individual interviews with the patients.\nVarieties of Inner Speech Questionnaire - Revised (VISQ-R)\nThe Varieties of Inner Speech Questionnaire - Revised (VISQ-R) was employed to assess individual variations in the phenomenological qualities and characteristics that distinguish the participants' usual inner speech [13, 19]. The VISQ-R includes 26 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Never, 7 = All the time). It includes the following five subscales: Dialogic inner speech, i.e. inner speaking that is conversational (5 items), Condensed inner speech, i.e. inner speaking that is shortened while retaining its meaning (5 items), other people in inner speech, i.e. experiencing other's imagined voices when inner speaking (5 items), evaluative/ critical inner speech, i.e. assessment of action that is critical and frequently negative using inner speech (7 items), and positive/regulatory inner speech, i.e. positive and constructive inner speaking (4 items) [19]. The Cronbach's alpha values were as follows: condensed ([alpha] = 0.96), dialogic ([alpha] = 0.96), evaluative ([alpha] = 0.85), other people ([alpha] = 0.89), positive ([alpha] = 0.93).\nPsychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS)\nThe PSYRATS [40] is a multidimensional assessment of delusions and auditory hallucinations with 17 items and a five-point Likert scale (0-4). The items for auditory hallucinations (11 items) are: frequency, duration, location, loudness, beliefs about origin of the voices, amount and intensity of negative content, amount and intensity of distress, disruption of life and controllability. The items for delusions (6 items) are: amount and duration of preoccupation, conviction, amount and intensity of distress and disruption of life caused by beliefs. Each subscale score is determined by adding together the scores of its items, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The AVH and delusions subscales had internal reliability coefficients of 0.96 and 0.94, respectively.\nMontreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)\nMontreal Cognitive Assessment or MoCA Test [41] is a widely used screening assessment tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MoCA has been implemented in clinical settings and is widely used as a scale in research. It has eight sections covering the following cognitive domains: Visuospatial abilities, executive functions, attention, memory, concentration, language, verbal abstraction, and orientation. As such, the MoCA covers a wider range of cognitive functions than other cognitive instruments [42-44], and provides information about general cognitive functioning disturbances in patients with schizophrenia, the MoCA test; and for schizophrenia patients. Our results suggest that the MoCA test is a useful screening instrument for assessing cognitive impairment in psychotic patients and has some advantages over other available instruments, such as its ease-of-use and short administration time. The MoCA has demonstrated its utility in schizophrenia patients aged over 18 years [42, 45]. A MoCA cutoff score of 23 allows for differentiating healthy cognitive aging from possible Mild Cognitive Impairment [46]. The Arabic translated version of the MoCA test is validated in Lebanon as an effective instrument for assessing cognitive deficits in schizophrenia [47]. The test had an internal reliability coefficient of 0.81.\nTranslation procedure of the scales\nThe original English versions of the VISQ-R and the PSYRATS were independently translated by two mental health professionals. The first one translated from English to Arabic. The Arabic version of the scales was then blindly back translated into English by the second professional. The two English versions were compared in order to discern discrepancies and solve any inconsistencies between the two versions until full agreement was found.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data was analyzed using SPSS version 26. Cronbach alphas were calculated for the assessed subscales to gain insight into their internal consistency. The student's independent t-test was used to compare continuous variables in two groups. Relationships between the continuous variables were first analyzed using Pearson's test. The PROCESS v.3.4 model 1 was used to conduct the moderation analysis; results were adjusted over all variables that showed a p < 0.25 in the bivariate analysis. A p < 0.05 was considered significant.\nThis study presents some limitations that need to be addressed in future research. Since it is a cross-sectional study, it cannot directly address the causal or mechanistic role of inner speech in the development of schizophrenia symptoms or cognitive disturbances. As such, longitudinal studies are required to confirm our assumptions. In addition, we may have a reporting bias since the main source of information is the patients describing their subjective inner speech experience and participant-researcher interaction bias since it is not self-filled and it may not have reflected participants' actual experiences of inner speech. This methodology relies heavily on the patient's metacognitive ability to reflect about thoughts, and this ability may be affected in some patients [68]. One strategy to overcome the constraints of the VISQ-R in future research is to reproduce our findings using more ecologically valid ways of evaluating inner speech, such as forms of experience sampling [11]. This method allows for inner experience to be captured in the moment. In addition, we did not collect and control for pharmacological data (e.g., type of antipsychotic drug, routes of administration, dose, duration of therapy, monotherapy/ combination), which might have affected our findings. Future studies should consider adjusting for these variables to rule out potential for residual confounding. Besides, our study only included patients from a single psychiatric hospital. This may have limited the sample size and the generalizability of our findings to other populations or clinical settings. Future studies should aim to recruit patients from multiple sites to enhance the validity of the results. Finally, we included chronic patients with schizophrenia who have been exposed to long-term effects of psychotic symptoms, antipsychotic therapy, and cognitive impairment; all these factors may interfere with our results. We thus recommend reproducing this study in patients with early stages of the disease.",
        "results": "Results\nModeration analysis revealed that, after controlling for delusions, the interaction of experiencing voices of other people in inner speech by cognitive performance was significantly associated with AVH.

        "discussion": "Discussion\nAn examination of the moderating effect of cognitive impairment is of high relevance for understanding the unclear interplay between inner speech and AVH. This study revealed that, after controlling for delusions, cognitive performance had a moderating effect on the positive relationship between a specific type of inner speech, i.e. other people in inner speech, and hallucinations. To our knowledge, this investigation is by far the first to study the moderating role of cognitive impairment in the relationship between inner speech and AVH. In addition, to date, this study is the first in its nature that investigates a culturally-dependent concept, i.e. inner speech, among patients with schizophrenia in an Arabic-speaking country of the Middle East and North African region.\nWe found that among schizophrenia patients, evaluative/critical inner speech was the most expressed quality of inner speech followed by condensed, positive, dialogic, and other people in inner speech. The correlation analysis indicated that condensed inner speech correlated to worse cognitive performance, whereas positive inner speech was associated with higher cognitive performance. Condensed inner speech was shown to be related to psychopathology [48], and the inclination to engage in condensed inner speech is inversely associated to convergent thinking capacity [49]. On another note, positive/regulatory inner speech may have cognitive benefits in the domains of creativity and imagination [19], which might explain the positive association between positive inner speech and MoCA scores. Previous research found that dialogic and evaluative inner speech predicted cognitive disorganization [50], and are most likely to affect executive processes especially that a critical evaluation of one's performance is likely to be disruptive [36]. However, no associations were discovered in this study. It is possible that the sample size or the specific measures used in this study were not sensitive enough to detect these associations, or that other factors not accounted for in this study may have influenced the results. Additionally, it is important to note that the relationship between inner speech and cognitive functioning is complex and may vary depending on the specific cognitive domain or task being assessed [51]. Therefore, it is possible that dialogic and evaluative inner speech may be more strongly related to cognitive functioning in certain contexts or for specific types of tasks that were not assessed in this study.\nIt was also demonstrated that evaluative, dialogic, and other people in inner speech correlated with AVH, which supports previous findings [20, 37, 48]. The relationship between dialogic inner speech and hallucinations is proposed to be bidirectional. It is likely that having more dialogic inner speech makes it easier to communicate with the voices. However, it is also possible that voices motivate people to engage in greater inner communication that is dialogic [20]. Besides, the correlation with evaluative inner speech may be due to the fact that the same factors affecting negative AVH may affect, in turn, ongoing inner speech, including adverse life experiences, emotion regulation approaches, the presence of physical or social threat, and a bad relationship with AVH [52]. In addition, positive inner speech has been shown to negatively correlate with delusions, as delusional content is most commonly persecutory and negative [53]. Since it is very common for AVH and delusions to coexist, and given that a unifying factor among these two is external agency, delusions should be controlled for in order to confirm the association between these aspects of inner speech and AVH. Moreover, higher other people in inner speech scores were significantly associated with more hallucinations, which is concordant with previous studies [20, 37, 48]. AVH are commonly perceived as social entities distinctive from self [54]. Furthermore, inner speech is thought to be the result of an internalization of linguistically mediated social interactions with other people, which, according to Vygotsky's model, are transformed into an internal dialogue with the self [55]. This internalization of the dialogue may not have been successful in individuals with schizophrenia. Therefore, the dominance of other people in inner speech in psychiatric patients experiencing AVH suggests that these voices may be misattributed to external sources.\nAfter controlling for delusions, our moderation analysis has shown that in patients having low and moderate cognitive performance, higher other people in inner speech was significantly associated with more AVH, which was not the case in patients with high cognitive performance. It is interesting to note here that the majority of the participating patients (40.2%) are illiterate which might have affected their cognitive functioning and performance, especially that higher level of education is coupled with greater long-term enhancements in cognitive performance [56]. This preliminarily finding presumes that cognitive impairment may play a role in the attribution of these voices perceived inside the head to external sources. A recent study has found that verbal hallucination proneness in a non-clinical sample was associated with higher rates of false recognition of high-frequency words and activation of language and decisional brain areas during false recognition of low-frequency words, suggesting a failure in the self-monitoring of inner speech [57]. These findings are consistent with the idea that inner speech may play a role in the development of auditory verbal hallucinations and that individuals who are prone to hearing voices may have difficulty distinguishing between their internal thoughts and external stimuli. Many theories concerning the origin of AVH claimed that impaired cognition leads to reduced inhibitory control which is suggested to result in the emergence of hallucinations [58]. Indeed, cognitive factors have been proposed to dissociate imagery and perception; and determine whether the source of sensory signals is externally or internally generated. Following the source monitoring framework, higher-level cortical circuits would be responsible for differentiating between cognitively-produced internal events (or inner speech) and perceived speech [59]. In the hallucinating brain, abnormal abundant inner speech may reflect a bias towards external sources and an impairment in reality monitoring. In other words, internally generated representations appear as if they were easily produced without cognitive effort, making them mistaken for perception triggered by external sources [60]. Several other cognitive functions like self-monitoring [35], and speech processing, the inhibition of irrelevant verbal information, have been shown to be impaired in patients experiencing AVH [61].\nConsequently, there is a need to focus on managing these specific elements of cognitive performance in order to help patients better monitor their inner speech and prevent the misattribution of the presence of other people's voices in inner speech to external sources, perceived as AVH. Thus, cognition and cognitive mechanisms underlying AVHs may be caused by a deficit in monitoring of inner speech; and cognitive impairment may, in turn, lead to misattributing the voices of others perceived in the inner speech as external voices experienced as AVH. Whereas a better monitoring of inner speech leads to a better cognitive performance which entails better controllability of the voices.\nClinical implications and research perspectives\nOur findings could help in better understanding the interplay between each type of inner speech and AVH in patients with schizophrenia. This may help inform the development of tailored preventions and interventions in order to ameliorate the inner experience and the disease prognosis. Many therapies focus on the patient's internal monologue such as compassionate focused therapy (CFT), which aims to establish more compassionate inner speech by changing content from negative or persecutory to more positive and comforting [62]. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be effective since a number of cognitive mechanisms are likely to play a role in the development of inner speech based-AVH [63]. Psychoeducation can help in explaining how inner speech arises and the many ways in which people might perceive it, such as varieties of inner speech that are perceived as other people's voices, and how stress can make it challenging to identify thought patterns as self-generated [63].\nOne important finding of this study that has great implication for clinical outcomes, future development in treatment, and for research, is that cognitive impairment moderates the cross-sectional, positive relationship between other people in inner speech and AVH. In other words, cognitive impairment has a strengthening effect on this relationship. This means that interventions aiming at improving cognitive performance (e.g., cognitive remediation [64]) may also have a beneficial effect in reducing hallucinations. We recommend further attention on inner speech as a possible causal factor of AVH, and call for more cross-cultural research on the direct relationship inner speech-hallucinations, and its potential moderators.\nFuture research can focus on other potential moderators of this association, such as insight, since lack of insight, or unawareness of one's mental disease is a common occurrence in psychiatric disorders [65], and insight has been suggested to rely on metacognitive skills for self-reflection and perspective-taking [66]. Moreover, individuals become self-aware of their current mental state when they engage in higher order cognition through self-talk about states of mind and personality traits [67]. Therefore, it is essential to explore other potential moderators related to inner speech and schizophrenia symptoms to improve the management of the condition.\nLimitations",

        "introduction": "Background\nNeuropsychological tests are designed to evaluate cognitive function by measuring different cognitive competencies, for example, memory, processing speed, problem-solving, planning, sustained attention, and cognitive flexibility. These executive functions stand in the basis of goal-directed behavior, thoughts, and emotion (Diamond 2013; Dugbartey et al. 2000). Neuropsychological tests of executive functions aim to assess these processes to acquire a reliable indication on performance in everyday living (Chan et al. 2008).\nNeuropsychological assessments using digital platforms",
        "methodology": "The Color Trails Test (CTT) is a pen and paper (P&P) test designed to measure cognitive function. The test consists of two parts that evaluate primarily sustained visual attention (Trails A) and divided attention (Trails B). Based on clinical interest in converting neuropsychological testing from P&P to computerized testing, we developed a digital version of the CTT ('Tablet-CTT'). Twenty-four young, healthy participants performed Trails A and B of both the original P&P and the Tablet-CTT. Hand kinematics were calculated using the continuous location of an electronic pen on the tablet touch screen. To compare motor control aspects, we differentiated for each test session the 'movement planning' and 'movement execution' times (accumulated across all single target-to-target trajectories). Concurrent validity was demonstrated by the high correlation between completion times of the P&P and Tablet-CTT, in both Trails A (r = 0.6; p < 0.005) and Trails B (r = 0.8; p < 0.001). Trails B yielded significantly longer completion times in both formats (p < 0.001). Examining hand kinematics in Tablet-CTT revealed that the difference in durations was mostly due to prolonged planning time, but also due to significantly lower execution velocity in Trails B (p < 0.001). Lastly, we found increased hand velocity during the planning phase in Trails B compared to Trails A (p < 0.001). This study demonstrates how transforming the CTT to a digital platform could be useful for studying cognitive-motor interactions in healthy individuals. Moreover, it could potentially serve as a diagnosis tool by introducing a more comprehensive testing method that incorporates online recordings of hand movements.\nAuthor(s): Noa Ben Yair 1 2 , Meytal Wilf 1 3 , Yotam Bahat 1 , Meir Plotnik 1 3 4\nAuthor Affiliations:\n(1) grid.413795.d, 0000 0001 2107 2845, Center of Advanced Technologies in Rehabilitation, Sheba Medical Center, , Ramat Gan, Israel\n(2) grid.7489.2, 0000 0004 1937 0511, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Ben-Gurion University, , Beer Sheva, Israel\n(3) grid.12136.37, 0000 0004 1937 0546, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, , Tel Aviv, Israel\n(4) grid.12136.37, 0000 0004 1937 0546, Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University, , Tel Aviv, Israel\nIn recent years, we witness a gradual transition from traditional pen and paper (P&P) testing to computer-based, digitized testing platforms, including personal computers, Virtual Reality (VR), touch screen tablets, and smartphones (Adams 2009; Dwolatzky et al. 2003). In these administration methods the examinee is electronically recorded, evaluated or both, and they often reflect direct adaptation of the P&P formats. Validation experiments show no significant difference in either test results or examinee performance between tests that were administered in the original P&P format and those that were administered using a digital platform (Retnawati 2015; Kuzmina 2010). However, digital testing offers enhanced ability to track an examinee's progress, and the immediate and automatic access to scoring and feedback for both the examinee and the examiner (Bayazit and Askar 2012; Plotnik et al. 2021). Apart from ease and accuracy of test administration, the greatest advantage of digital testing for both research and clinical purposes is the opportunity it offers to gain information about perception and behavior that was previously inaccessible (e.g., motor planning and movement execution kinematics).\nThe Color Trails Test\nThe Color Trails Test (CTT) (D'Elia et al. 1996) is a culture-fair version of the Trail Making Test (TMT) (Reitan 1992), which is among the most popular tests designed to measure cognitive function. The test evaluates the following putative cognitive domains: attention, sustained visual attention, divided attention, sequencing, mental flexibility, visual search/scanning, graphomotor function, eye-hand coordination, speed of information processing (D'Elia et al. 1996). It has several clinical applications, these include evaluation of persons with neurodegenerative conditions, e.g., Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Kim et al. 2014; Cahn et al. 1995), and evaluation of many psychiatric and neurological disorders (e.g., frontal lobe damage; for review see Stuss and Levine 2002). The CTT consists of two parts: trails A, which targets sustained visual attention (SVA), in which the examinee is required to draw a connecting line between 25 numbered circles on a sheet of paper (in consecutive order) as quickly and accurately as possible and Trails B, which evaluates mainly the complex task of divided attention (DA) and the ability to transition between two different concepts simultaneously, in which the examinee has to also alternate between target colors. Trail B is therefore characterized by longer completion times than Trails A (Gaudino et al. 1995).\nDuring the test, an examiner records the completion times of trails A and trails B separately and counts the number of errors for each part. The diagnosis of the examinee's cognitive state is determined by the score of the test and the number of errors. The scale of diagnostics includes 8 stages from severely impaired to above average (D'Elia et al. 1996; Reitan 1992). To this day, the CTT is administered using a pen and paper and requires a trained examiner for performing the test. Moreover, the only two measurements of the CTT are the time and number of errors.\nCTT and TMT in digital platforms\nPrevious research in which the TMT was implemented using a 2-dimensional digital platform (i.e., Tablet) confirmed the validity of the digital test, by achieving relatively high correlation (i.e., trails A: 0.55 < r < 0.65; trails B: 0.65 < r < 0.79) between test results in both methods (original and digital) (Fellows et al. 2017).\nThe CTT has been recently translated to a digital platform using Virtual Reality (VR). The VR-based version of the classic CTT was validated on young, middle aged, and older adults (Plotnik et al. 2021). The VR-based CTT enhances the reflection of daily performance since visual scanning and hand movements are not limited to the size of the page and are instead performed allowing three-dimensional hand trajectories. However, the VR-based CTT deviates from the original P&P version in the spatial arrangement of the targets and the type of hand movements needed to hit the targets (gross manual movements). Therefore, as a bridging step, and to draw conclusions on the motor attributes of the standard P&P-based CTT, which is extensively used for clinical purposes, a digital application that is more similar to the original P&P test is needed. Furthermore, a tablet-based version can become an accessible tool for clinical use.\nCognitive-motor interactions\nBoth trails A and trails B of the CTT are based on specific cognitive skills that are required to complete the task and therefore can reflect the level of cognitive function. By its nature, the CTT also engages motor behavior to express cognitive abilities of SVA and DA. Motor actions have several underlying cognitive processes, including sequencing, monitoring, and movement planning (Roebers and Kauer 2009). Given a spatial target, computational processes select the movement trajectory to be accomplished amongst a myriad of possible trajectories that would all attain the desired target (Franklin and Wolpert 2011).\nDuring the performance of the CTT, the examinee needs to sequence the targets to be reached, then plan and execute an accurate motor act to attain the targets (i.e., reaching movements). We posit that performance evaluation should address explicitly cognitive-motor interactions, i.e., explore how specific cognitive skills affect motor function (Song 2019). However, the P&P format of the CTT does not allow delineating fine motor aspects of the test performance, for example execution velocity, or smoothness of the movement. On the other hand, in digital testing platforms multiple parameters can be recorded electronically (e.g., hand kinematics), which enables examining motor function while performing different cognitive tasks (Plotnik et al. 2021; Scheuermann and Bj\u00f6rnsson 2009).\nResearch objective\nIn this study, we adapted and translated the P&P CTT into tablet format (Tablet-CTT) aiming to achieve two goals: (a) Evaluate concurrent validity of the tablet version of the CTT. (b) Establish the characterization of cognitive-motor interactions while performing motor activity during DA task (Trails B) as compared to SVA task (Trails A).\nMethods\nParticipants\nParticipants were 24 healthy, right-handed, young individuals (age: 27 [Formula omitted] 3.08 years; education: 14.58 [Formula omitted] 2.06 years; 12 females) with no cognitive impairment. All participants signed informed consent prior to entering the study, and study protocol was approved by the Sheba Medical Center, institutional review board (IRB).\nSample size calculations: the first objective of the study calls for the evaluation of concurrent validity of the new Tablet-CTT. To that aim, we intended to perform correlation analysis between the completion times of the Tablet-CTT and the gold standard P&P CTT, anticipating high correlation coefficient values (> 0.6; at level of significance [less than or equal to] 0.05). Since we planned to conduct the correlation analyses on performances of both tails A and trails B, the level of significance was set on 0.025 in order to account for two analyses obtained from the same participants. Our power calculations suggest that in order to obtain correlation coefficient equal to 0.6, at level of significance = 0.025 with 80% power, data from n = 23 participants are needed.\nThe second objective calls for characterization of the effects of the type of cognitive tasks on motor performance, in other words to describe how target-to-target hand trajectories differ between trails A and B. This is an exploratory objective, with no previous data nor specific a priori hypothesis. In the literature we found recommendations for sample size for exploratory and pilot trials to range between 10 and 30 participants (Hill 1998; Isaac and Michael 1995). Therefore, we assumed that n = 23 that was found to be sufficient for the concurrent validity objective of the study would potentially allow the achievement of the second objective. Eventually we recruited 24 participants.\nTablet-CTT\nThe digital CTT was performed using a custom application installed on a Lenovo Yoga computer (Lenovo Yoga C740 I14ML). The application was developed using Unity3D. The software was designed for offline, and logistically the use in our experiments was done using battery power.\nThe digital test was designed so it resembles the original test in almost every aspect: the size of the screen is the same size of an A4 paper sheet (21 x 29 cm), and the targets on the screen are located in the exact same coordinates as they are on the paper in the traditional test. Likewise, the pen was replaced with an electronic pen (Lenovo Active Pen 2; see Fig. 1C). All participants found the use of the electronic pen intuitive, and no technical issues arose with touch tracing. Note that the digital pen does not capture the force exerted during the use, and the drawing resolution is limited to the screen resolution.Fig. 1\nTrails A and Trails B of the CTT (D'Elia et al. 1996). A Trails A, which mainly evaluates sustained visual attention (SVA), the circles contain numbers from 1 to 25, and the examinee is instructed to connect the numbered circles in ascending order without removing the pen from the paper. B Trails B, which mainly evaluates sustained divided attention (DA), there are two sets of circles with the numbers 2 to 25, one set painted pink, and one painted yellow, and one pink circle with the number 1. The examinee is instructed to connect the numbered circles in an ascending order alternating between pink and yellow (i.e., 1-pink, 2-yellow, 3-pink, 4-yellow, etc.). C Each examinee performed Trails A and Trails B once in the original P&P method and once using the Tablet version of the CTT\nThe Tablet-CTT and the P&P CTT include four parts: practice A, test A, practice B, and test B. In the practice sets, the participants are required to draw a line connecting only 8 circles instead of 25. Explicit performance demonstration is drawn beneath the eight circles in the practice forms. The data from the practice tests is recorded but not used for scoring or analysis.\nThe x and y coordinates of the electronic pen across the touch screen were sampled at a rate of 111 Hz. The output included the sampled kinematic data, a documentation of the correct and erroneous hits and the participants' demographic data.\nInstructions for each part of the test are presented on the tablet's screen at the beginning of each part, similar to the oral instructions given by the examiner at the beginning of the original test. Afterwards, the participants are prompted to press a start button for the recording to begin. During all parts of the test, the path the participant draws is visible and presented on the tablet's screen (see Fig. 1C). An error will be counted when the participant's pen touches an incorrect target. In this case, a sound is heard, and a warning sign appears on the screen.\nProcedure\nAll the participants performed all four parts of the P&P CTT and all four parts of the Tablet-CTT. There were no technical malfunctions during the administration of the tests. To prevent biased results, the order of the test administration (Tablet first or P&P first) was counterbalanced, and a minimum half an hour interval was taken between the two versions of the test to mitigate learning effect. The completion times and number of errors of trails A and trails B of the P&P were recorded manually using a stopwatch and a pen. For the Tablet-CTT, these performance features were recorded digitally. The number of errors was not used in the analysis since most of the participants had 0-1 errors.\nThe output of the tablet's software includes sampled signals of x and y coordinates, representing the location of the electronic pen on the touch screen, and sampled time signal. Velocity profiles were derived for all 24 target-to-target movements using the x , y , and time signals and were calculated as follows: [Formula omitted]\nA Butterworth low pass filter with knee frequency of 5 Hz was used to clean the original velocity signal.\nMovement planning and execution\nVelocity profiles are common outcomes in studying motor control models. The full velocity profile of the pen's path during the CTT is comprised of 24 movements connecting between 25 targets so that each velocity peak represents a single movement between two targets.\nTo investigate motor control during Trails A in comparison to Trails B, we attempted (1) to explain the longer completion times seen in trails B and (2) to compare different parameters of hand kinematics during the planning and execution of movements. To this aim, we first needed to separate the full tests into 24 individual movement segments, and by that to differentiate between 'planning' and 'execution'. The planning periods are defined from the time after touching a target and prior to initiating a movement which ends reaching the next target. The execution period is defined as the time during which actual hand movement between targets occurs. We developed an algorithm written in MATLAB, that performs automatic segmentation separating the full velocity signals of each participant to planning and execution phases.\nThe offset of each movement is determined based on the point where the hand velocity rises above 5% of the maximal execution velocity of the current target-to-target movement.\nThe onset of each movement is determined using a retrogressive algorithm which locates the point between the end point of the previous movement and the maximal velocity of the current movement, where both the hand velocity exceeds 5% of the maximal execution velocity and the acceleration exceeds 5% of the maximal acceleration of the current movement. Figure 2 demonstrates these definitions.Fig. 2\nPlanning and execution periods associated with target-to-target hand movements. One example of a velocity signal representing 9 hand movements between targets in Trials A (top) and one example of same signal in Trails B (bottom) from the same participant. The green vertical line denotes the onset of movement execution, while the red line denotes the end of execution. Accordingly, gray areas (i.e., to the right of the red vertical line through the green vertical line) denote planning periods, and the intervals between the green vertical lines and the subsequent red vertical lines are the execution periods\nTo understand the contribution of the planning duration to the longer completion time in trails B we calculated the percentage of the accumulative time of the planning periods out of the total completion time for each test session. We also calculated the percentage of the difference in completion time between trails A and trails B that is explained by excessive planning time in trails B as compared to trails A as described in the following equation:[Formula omitted]\nMotor performance under sustained visual - and divided-attention\nWe investigated the effects of the cognitive task of divided attention on motor function, by extracting different motor characteristics that could help us identify unique movement patterns in trails B (DA) in comparison to trails A (SVA). Then, we compared the following measurements from trails A and trails B and performed statistical analysis to determine which were affected by the cognitive task as described in Table 1 and Fig. 3: Table 1\nList of extracted parameters used to quantify cognitive-motor interactions\nPlanning\nPlanning duration out of the total completion time [%]\nMaximal velocity (between each target-to-target movement) [cm/sec]\nExecution\nMean velocity (for each target-to-target movement) [cm/sec]\nMaximal velocity (for each target-to-target movement) [cm/sec]\nTime to reach velocity peak out of total completion time\n(for each target-to-target movement) [%]\nAll these metrics apart from the planning duration were extracted for movements 1-23 in trails A and trails B of the Tablet-CTT (the last execution towards target 25 was not considered since the recording stopped once the participant hit the target, forming an incomplete hand execution). The average values were calculated for each examinee and then compared between trails A and trails B using statistical tools\nFig. 3\nExample of extracted parameters for each movement. For graphical demonstration we pooled all movements together (N = 552 movements). The average velocity of 552 hand movements from trails A (green) and from trails B (pink), the dashed horizontal traces represent the average execution velocity in each trail, and the dashed vertical traces represent the average percentage of time out of the total completion time it took to reach the peak velocity\nWe also examined the deviation of each target-to-target movement from the minimal jerk trajectory model (Flash and Hogan 1985), and from a straight line. The results for the comparisons of the latter two features (i.e., between Trials A and B) are presented in the supplementary material .\nStatistical analysis\nValidation of the Tablet-CTT\nTo assess the validity of the Tablet-CTT, we compared the completion times (trails A and trails B) of the Tablet-CTT and P&P CTT. We used Analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess trail effect (Trails B vs. A) and tablet-CTT format effect (Tablet-CTT vs P&P CTT) on completion times. Eta Squared was computed as a measure of effect size. In addition, we calculated the Pearson correlation between the completion times of the tablet-CTT and the completion times of the P&P CTT for both trails A and trails B.\nComparisons of movement features between trails A and trails B\nAll the comparisons between different measurements from trails A and trails B were performed using Paired Sample t -tests. Normality assumption checks were made for all the extracted parameters using Shapiro-wilk test, normality was confirmed in all cases (p [greater than or equal to] 0.05) except for the completion times of trails B using the Tablet-CTT (p = 0.002).\nThe level of significance was determined as p [Formula omitted] 0.05. The statistical analysis was made using JASP, an open-source program for statistical analysis and visualization.\nWe estimated to what extent the increase in performance time seen in Trails B as compared to Trails A can be explained by additional planning durations (c.f. Eq. 2, see methods), Panel B of Fig. 6 depicts this analysis. For each participant (abscissa) the relative contribution of additional planning time to the overall increase in performance time of Trails B as compared to Trails A is shown (84.09 \u00b1 16.59%; rage 52.27-100%).\nHand kinematics during the planning phases\nTheoretically, planning periods are characterized by little to no hand movements. However, we observed a differential effect with this regard. In Trails B, during the planning periods it is noticeable that the hand is more dynamic as expressed by scattered velocity peaks (see for example, planning periods depicted in Fig. 7 by boxplots representing the median values of velocity peak in trails A and tails B). In fact, the average maximal hand velocity during planning periods in Trails B is almost twice as large as in Trails A across all participants, i.e., 1.54 \u00b1 0.64 cm/sec as compared to 0.86 \u00b1 0.41 cm/sec, respectively (t(23) = 4.514; p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.921).Fig. 7\nHand kinematics during the planning phases.

The green vertical lines denote the onset of movement execution, while the red lines denote the end of execution. B Maximal recorded velocity during planning periods (averaged across the 24 periods) in Trails A and Trails B (green and pink, respectively) graph specifications same as in Fig. 4 (***p [less than or equal to] 0.001)\nVelocity profile analyses during the execution period effects of sustained visual and divided attention\nAs depicted in Fig. 8, the execution speed was significantly lower while performing trails B in comparison to trails A. The mean of execution velocity over all 552 recorded hand movements (movement 24 of each trail was excluded) between targets was 14.76 \u00b1 2.78 cm/sec in trails A and 10.55 \u00b1 2.36 cm/sec in trails B (t (23) = 11.567; p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 2.361). The maximal execution velocity was 27.18 \u00b1 6.29 cm/sec in trails A and 19.31 \u00b1 4.86 cm/sec in trails B (t (23) = 9.536; p < 0.001; cohen's d = 1.946).Fig. 8\nAnalysis of Execution Velocity. A Mean execution velocity, B maximal execution velocity and C the percentage of time it took to reach velocity peak in Trails A and B (green and pink, respectively). Graph specifications same as in Fig. 4 (**p [less than or equal to] 0.005, ***p [less than or equal to] 0.001)\nNext, we examined the shape of the velocity profile during execution, focusing on the temporal dimension. We calculated for each velocity profile, that represents a single movement between two targets (total of 552 velocity profiles), the time point where the velocity reached its maximal value relative to the total execution time (Fig. 8C). For trails A and trails B time to reach peak velocity was 43.74 \u00b1 4.43% and 47.27 \u00b1 4.86% respectively. We found a significant difference between trails A and trails B with medium effect size (Fig. 8C; t (23) = 3.256; p < 0.005; Cohen's d = 0.679).\nThe first objective of this study was to validate a tablet-based version of the Color Trails Test. We achieved this goal by testing healthy young participants and comparing the completion times of tests performed using the tablet application to the completion times of the tests performed using the original P&P method for each subject. The results showed that the format had no significant effect on the completion time and that a significant difference in the completion time of trails A and trails B was retained in both formats, as expected. Moreover, a significantly high correlation between the Tablet-CTT and the P&P CTT was achieved in both trails A and trails B. These findings suggest that the Tablet-CTT has the same outcomes as the original P&P test. Thus, we suggest that the Tablet-CTT measures the same cognitive skills that the traditional test does (i.e., SVA and DA).\nPrevious attempts to translate the CTT into a tablet application showed no relationship between the scores of the original CTT and the Tablet-CTT. In one of the most recent studies, due to technological challenges the test was altered so that the participants were asked to tap the numbers in the correct order instead of connecting them in a sequenced line. This change might be the main reason for the low correlation between performance on the P&P CTT and the Tablet-CTT (Maguire et al. 2019). In the current study, the Tablet and the software aimed to imitate the original test as accurately as possible, and therefore showed a higher correlation between the P&P and digital-CTT results.\nCognitive-motor interactions\nThe quantitative analysis performed in this study demonstrates how motor behavior changes when engaging in a cognitive task that involves divided attention (trails B of the CTT) as compared to sustained visual attention (trails A of the CTT).\nIndeed, our findings continue line of evidence on the relationship between cognitive and motor functions. Research has shown co-activations between the prefrontal cortex, the cerebellum, and the basal ganglia during different motor and cognitive tasks, especially when the task is more difficult, in a new task, or when the conditions of a task change (Desmond et al. 1997; Leisman et al. 2016). With more explicit relation to the present study, neuroimaging and lesion studies contribute to disentangling the different processes contributing to trail-making tests performance (specifically TMT, results regarding CTT are still lacking). These point to prefrontal and parietal structures as mediating the performance, with TMT-A activating visuo-spatial structures and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex associated with TMT-B performance TMT (Varjacic et al. 2018). In line with this evidence, the current study presents insights on how exactly a specific cognitive task affects planning and execution of hand movements and shows the potential of investigating this relationship further.\nWe separated our analysis of motor performance to measurements related to the two main components of test performance: planning and execution. The motor planning component in both trails A and trails B, includes locating the next target and deciding on the optimal trajectory from all possible trajectories, while motor execution is the outcome of the planning, but might also reflect additional underlying cognitive processes.\nWe probed for the movement features accounting for the overall longer completion time obtained for trails B. We discovered that the time difference between trails A and B was comprised mainly (~ 85%) of extra planning time, but also (~ 15%) of extra execution time. This outcome suggests that while performing trails B of the CTT which involves DA, the participants spent more time on planning their movements in comparison to trails A of the CTT which only involves SVA. This is presumably due to the need to search among a larger set of targets in trails B (50 instead of 25), and the nature of the DA task, which requires taking into account the color component of the target in addition to the number component. Similarly, Du et al. (2022) investigated a digital version of TMT, and divided the completion time into 'drawing time' and 'thinking time'. They found that 'drawing time' was correlated to total completion time and other functional measures in TMT-A, but 'thinking time' was more dominant in TMT-B.\nIt is a widely accepted hypothesis that motor commands are assembled before movement execution, during the motor planning stages and that the planning stage has the largest effect on execution variability in comparison to other stages (Haith et al. 2016), though it is yet unknown exactly how the variability of execution reflects in motor planning. Moreover, it was proven that hand trajectories that differ in complexity (length and shape) result in different planning intervals (Orban de Xivry et al. 2017).\nThe findings of our study also show that there is a variability in motor planning components, depending on the complexity of the cognitive task and the specific skills required to accomplish each task, even if the trajectories are similar.\nTo understand the effect on motor execution, we compared measurements of execution velocity between trails A and trails B. This comparison revealed that the execution speed was significantly slower in trails B, by showing that both the maximum and the mean of the execution velocity were significantly lower. Therefore, the execution duration was longer during trails B, though it had a smaller effect on the time difference than the planning duration.\nAn additional understanding of cognitive-motor interactions was achieved by comparing the velocity peak location in time. The results showed that although the participants dedicated more time for planning their path, the movements in trails B were more hesitant. This was reflected by a slower increase in the velocity profiles in trails B. A possible explanation is that the cognitive load exists during the execution as well, causing the participant to be more engaged in the executive function of DA rather than in motor execution.\nThe results of the planning velocity analysis proved that the velocity while planning DA-related movements (trails B) reaches higher peaks than while planning SVA related movements (trails A). Relying on this outcome, we believe that when combining the executive functions of DA and motor planning it is more difficult to suppress hand jitters. A recent study by Linari et al. (2022) used a digital application of the TMT integrated with eye movement tracking and generated an internal measure for inhibitory control on movement initiation. This measure was able to differentiate between movement following correct target detection versus following a false target detection, but, unlike our current study, showed similar movement patterns for Trails A and Trails B. The difference from the results we report here might be related to either on the differences between TMT-B and CTT-B (numbers/letters alternatives as opposed to numbers/numbers alternatives) or on the difference between the device used for hand interaction-a computer mouse in Linari et al., versus a digital pen-with the latter potentially being more sensitive to small-scale movements. Likewise, there is evidence in the literature (regarding TMT) that the main difference between TMT-A and TMT-B lies in the cognitive flexibility abilities, and not necessarily in the ability to maintain set (Arbuthnott and Frank 2000; Kortte et al. 2002). In light of this notion, one possibility of interpretation of the larger overall hesitation and excessive movement during planning time in Trails B, is that participants need to execute task selection process an inhibit the incorrect execution plan based on wrong task/target (Linari et al. 2022).\nFinally, the results of the trajectories analysis revealed that the DA task did not affect the smoothness of the trajectory or its linearity (see supplementary material file). A previous study showed that there was a significant difference between the deviation from the minimal jerk model of velocity profiles from trails B in comparison to trails A (trails B had larger deviation) (Ben Gal et al. 2019). The reason for this difference was the planning periods that are characterized by lower velocity than the velocity of execution periods which shifted the average velocity profile of trails B to the right, and by that skewed the pattern of velocity profile, thus differentiating it from the minimal jerk model. Conversely, in this current analysis, we excluded the planning periods and compared only the velocity profiles of the execution periods.\nFuture directions\nWe have showed the importance of converting the CTT to a digital platform mainly for research use, but there is also a potential of implementing the Tablet-CTT in clinical use. A digital adaptation of the CTT will help achieve a more efficient and accurate testing and training system, which captures greater amounts of data, as well as provide richer outcome measures to account for functional abilities/deficits (cf., Du et al. 2022; Linari et al. 2022).\nTo prove the efficiency of this tool, different populations should be tested including participants with different levels of cognitive impairments and different age groups (our study tested only young, healthy, highly educated participants). The results of such study should then be compared with those from the current work to identify the differences in motor function which can be related to cognitive impairment.\nIt is worth mentioning the relatively small sample size in the current study (24 participants). The present sample was sufficient to provide initial evidence on the concurrent validity of the Tablet-CTT, and to provide preliminary data on the effect of cognitive task on the motor performance of serial of small reaching movements. However, larger sample is needed to assess variability in performance, i.e., spanning over larger ages, as the present sample was relatively homogeneous.\nFinally, the analysis of movement patterns could be performed at the individual level to provide a specific and more detailed feedback to the patient, potentially assisting targeted rehabilitation strategies.\nAuthor contributions\nNBY: methodology, formal analysis, investigation, visualization, writing.

        "abstract": "The research aim was to find out whether providing information on psychological preparation would produce changes in pre-retirees retirement planning intentions and advance retirement concepts. In the experiment, we divided the pre-retirees (N = 567, mean age of 54.91, SD = 3.55 years, working full-time) into four groups (with and without pre-test, with and without the information provided). There were no differences between the pre-test and post-test conditions. However, the results showed that participants acknowledged the need to prepare for retirement even before the intervention. The participants also rated themselves as psychologically prepared for retirement. The results also indicated which pre-retirees could benefit from psychological preparation: those who believe they would have a disadvantageous and unfavorable retirement transition. The next group is the ones who tend to conceptualize their retirement as an imposed disruption as they also perceive their psychological resources for a successful transition as insufficient.\nKey words: retirement planning, retirement conceptualization, retirement psychological preparation, pre-retirees",
        "introduction": "Introduction\nThe transition from work to retirement involves behavioral and psychological distancing from employment, often accompanied by normative lifestyle changes and other social changes that may affect the well-being and health of newly retired persons (Osborne, 2012; Rodriguez-Monforte et al., 2020). Some research studies in the retirement literature bring to the fore arguments about adverse changes and losses of recent retirees (Pinquart & Schindler, 2007; Wang, 2007; Wang, Henkens, & van Solinge, 2011; Seiferling & Michel, 2017). Lately, a growing number of research studies produced findings indicating positive retirement transition and outcomes (Hansson et al., 2018; Hansson et al., 2020; Henning, Lindwall, & Johansson, 2016; Lindwall et al., 2017; Sohier, van Ootegem, & Verhofstadt, 2021). Retirement research studies estimate that approximately one-third of the retired population has adjustment problems (La Rue, Haslam, & Steffens, 2022). The consent prevails that planning and preparation for retirement contribute to smoother retirement adjustment and more retirement satisfaction (Barbosa, Monteiro, & Murta, 2016; Hurtado & Topa, 2019; La Rue, Haslam, & Steffens, 2022; Topa et al., 2009). Our goal in this research study was to examine whether planning for retirement in pre-retirees can be encouraged by simple psychological intervention. Specifically, we were interested in promoting retirement consideration and planning for all pre-retirees in general by providing alerting information about the changes that retirement will bring to their lives and suggesting ways to deal with them.\nRetirement Preparation through Psychological Interventions\nPsychological preparation for retirement seeks to inform, instruct, coach, consult, and variously equip pre-retirees for adjusting to identity change and new relationships after leaving employment (Noone, Stephens, & Alpass, 2010; Schlossberg, 1981, 2011; Seidl et al., 2021). Since it is aimed at activating and strengthening individual resources, it engages several mental processes and activities, and as a result, can take various forms.",
        "methodology": "The preparatory psychological interventions for retirement aspire to increase well-being in the general population and thus can be qualified as positive psychological interventions (Bolier et al., 2013), as opposed to interventions aimed at reducing symptoms, problems, or disorders (Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009). They belong to low-intensity methods focusing on prevention (Durgante et al., 2020), also allowing individuals to engage in self-help methods (van Agteren et al., 2021). Psychological retirement preparation belongs to wise psychological interventions, which Walton refers to as \"psychological remedies for social and personal problems\" (Walton, 2014; Walton & Wilson, 2018; Walton & Crum, Eds., 2020). Wise psychological interventions target a healthy general population, and they are ordinary, short, and frugal. Their main characteristic is that they are psychologically precise because they target those psychological processes that are most involved in the problem (this is what the adjective \"wise\" is supposed to express, see Walton, 2014). A common feature of all the above approaches is that they target all people, not just those requesting an intervention.\nIn their reviews, Leandro-Franga et al. (2016) and Rodriguez-Monforte et al. (2020) noted the lack of interventions for improving well-being across the retirement transition. The authors analyzed eleven and fifteen articles, respectively, most of which reported positive outcomes. However, a comparison of their impact and effectiveness was hindered by their high variation--in content, duration, target group, method of delivery, and professionals involved. The authors concluded, among other things, that the small number of studies, their heterogeneity, and their medium-low quality did not allow them to formulate valid conclusions and establish whether these interventions prevented frailty. Note that both reviews compared long-running and complex retirement preparation programs.\nAn example of a psychological intervention based on information provision is the theory of transition by Schlossberg and its applications in psychological counseling (Anderson, Goodman, & Schlossberg, 2012; Schlossberg, 1981; Schlossberg, 2011). Its primary goal is to help manage life transitions (including retirement). A transition is a phase of relational and personal changes, including attempts to cope with concerns, anxiety, and efforts to find new sources of support. Four factors influence a person's ability to cope with the changes: Situation, Self, Support, and Strategies. An individual can view a Situation positively, negatively, or as being benign, depending on such issues as how the transition relates to one's social background, which aspects one can control, and how significant are the stresses associated with the necessary changes. Self includes personal and demographic characteristics and psychological resources as coping tools--ego development, outlook, commitment, and values. Social support includes intimate relationships, family, friends, co-workers, and communities. The fourth <S> is Strategies used to control the meaning of the problem and manage stress to help the adjustment without being overwhelmed (Anderson, Goodman, & Schlossberg, 2012; Goodman & Pappas, 2000). Schlossberg's transition theory and models have found wide practical application in counseling adults in their life transitions, including retirement (Schlossberg, 2007, 2009, 2011; Schlossberg & Kay, 2010). The main principle is that the more aspects of coping factors a person identifies in advance, the better he or she is prepared to handle them in anticipatory socialization.\nProviding Psychological Information as Retirement Preparation\nEnsuring adequate information is the first step in all change management strategies (White, 1976). The provision of relevant information is often sufficient for the general population to apply the appropriate procedure and solve personal or/and social problems (Walton, 2014; Walton & Wilson, 2018). As for preparing for retirement, most research studies concentrate on the effect of providing financial information on financial preparation for retirement (Dolls et al., 2018; Hoffmann & Plotkina, 2020; see Birkenmaier, Kim, & Maynard, 2021 for a review).\nIn contrast to financial information, providing psychologically saturated information explores more goals, not just cognitive ones (Walton, 2014). In the case of retirement preparation, the goal is to evoke new meanings ascribed to retirement and retirement transition. The information would draw attention to lifestyle changes fresh retirees will face and set appropriate attitudes and planning orientations for coping with the challenges. Therefore, the information provided should be minimally directive, allow self-reflection, and draw new conclusions about the importance of retirement preparation. Walton & Wilson (2018) refer to this strategy as prompting new meanings. This can be achieved by evoking questions (e.g., how might thinking about retirement be useful to you, your friends, or relatives?), altering situations (e.g., suggesting starting a business instead of a job), or providing new information (e.g., about how many of a person's friends or neighbors are already preparing for retirement).\nTo the best of our knowledge, the effects of providing psychological retirement information have not been examined yet. One recent exception is the study by Gettings and Anderson (2021), which examined the sources of information about retirement, the meanings ascribed to retirement, and associations between sources of retirement information and meaning. However, the participants in this study were young adults for whom preparing for retirement is not urgent.\nWe found a positive psychological intervention tool titled The Transition Guide by Schlossberg and Kay (https://transitionguide. com). It is a self-scoring assessment that helps individuals manage the transition. The Transition Guide prompts individuals to engage in a self-help method to prepare themselves for retirement. It allows pre-retirees to focus their attention on the changes they will face and sets the intention to plan and cope with changes by stating their position in retirement preparedness. Compared to other tools, this tool is accessible, available online, and easy to understand. It provides immediate feedback, and the participant does not need any assistance. We chose and adjusted the Transition Guide in our research as tailored psychological information that can prompt pre-retirees to think about and plan for retirement (see more in the Method section). Providing information about retirement is an essential first step for pre-retirees. For this goal, we considered the Transition Guide a simple and quick tool for the general population of pre-retirees.\nTo learn more about the effect of psychological retirement preparation using a sample of the Slovak pre-retirees, we investigated the impact of the information on retirement planning intention and retirement concepts such as lifestyle expectations in retirement. We chose the four retirement lifestyle concepts by Hornstein and Wapner (1985). Retirement can be seen as a) an opportunity to make a new start, b) prolongation of a pre-retirement lifestyle, c) an unwelcome disruption, and d) a transition to old age. Several studies on retirement succeeded in using these concepts (Bacova & Halama, 2020; Gee & Baillie, 1999; Hanson & Wapner, 1994; Hopkins, Roster, & Wood, 2006). Recently, in newly retirees, research found a positive correlation between retirement satisfaction and the retirement concepts of New Beginning and Continuation, and a negative correlation between retirement satisfaction and the retirement concepts of Imposed Disruption and Transition to Old Age (Bacova, Halama, & Kordacova, 2022).\nThe Current Study\nThis research study is theoretically based on confirmed extended engagement for a predictable and expected retirement transition in pre-retirees (Ekerdt et al., 2001; Ekerdt, Kosloski, & Deviney, 2000). We also refer to the potential precariousness of the retirement transition in the lives of newly retired persons (Pinquart & Schindler, 2007; Wang, 2007; Wang, Henkens, & van Solinge, 2011; Seiferling & Michel, 2017). The study builds on the assumption that providing information is one of the effective forms of psychological intervention (Bolier et al., 2013; Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009; van Agteren et al., 2021; Walton, 2014; Walton & Wilson, 2018).\nBased on these theories and empirical findings, our research aims to verify whether information on psychological retirement preparation will increase pre-retirees' intention to plan for retirement and advance their retirement concepts.\nOur study contributes to the literature in several ways. In particular, we add to the debate on means to increase psychological preparation and interest in retirement planning (e.g., Chan, Chung, & Yeung, 2020). Doing so is essential, as prior work finds a positive association between retirees' satisfaction and pre-retirement engagement (Hurtado & Topa, 2019). The need for psychological retirement preparation is largely confirmed and rightly emphasized (Adams & Rau, 2011). However, given the variability of the psychological resource to manage retirement in pre-retirees, little is known about what forms and durations of such training are sufficient, necessary, and justified (Rodriguez-Monforte et al., 2020). Notably, the role of information in stimulating retirement planning in the general pre-retirees' population is not yet sufficiently investigated (Leandro-Franga et al., 2016). We, therefore, strive to contribute to the answers to a broader question: Do all pre-retirees need psychological preparation for retirement if only some of them are experiencing difficulties in retirement transition? And specifically: Is providing information on psychological issues of retirement efficient enough to increase interest in one's own retirement transition?\nTherefore, in our study, we used a brief online intervention that provided information on the retirement transition, confronted the participants with the changes that retirement would bring to them, and diagnosed their psychological resources for managing these changes.\nHypotheses\nWe hypothesized that the information provided would significantly increase participants' belief that they need to consider and plan retirement and raise their interest in these activities compared to the control groups (H1). Further, we hypothesized that the information provided would increase participants' retirement conceptualizations positively associated with retirement satisfaction (New Beginning and Continuation) (H2). The information on retirement issues would decrease those retirement conceptualizations negatively associated with retirement satisfaction (Transition to Old Age and Imposed Disruption) compared to the control groups (H3).\nMethod\nSample\nA Slovak research agency recruited the participants following three criteria: participants had to be over 50 years old, working full-time, and not retired. The participants responded through an online platform. All participants gave an informed consent before continuing with the survey. In the sample, we included only participants who passed the attention-check items and finished both rounds of the data collection. They received compensation from the research agency for participating in the research. The final sample consisted of 567 Slovak participants with a mean age of 54.91 (SD = 3.55) years, 249 were men (M = 54.83, SD = 3.70) and 318 were women (M = 54.98, SD = 3.43). Mean years until retirement age was 8.20 (SD = 4.08, Mdn = 8). The modal level of education was a high school degree (46.6%), followed by a university degree (33.0%), a vocational school (12.7%), a doctorate or higher degree (3.7%), Bachelor's degree (3.4%), and elementary school (0.7%).\nProcedure\nWe used Solomon's four-group experimental design to assess the plausibility of pretest sensitization effects, that is, to control whether the mere act of taking a pre-test influenced scores on subsequent administrations of the post-test (Braver & Braver, 1988; see Figure 1). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: the intervention group with a pre-test (N = 152), the intervention group without a pre-test (N = 159), the control group with a pre-test (N = 125), and the control group without pre-test (N = 131). Following, all participants answered items about their gender, age, education, retirement proximity, satisfaction with their current job, anticipation of retirement adjustment, and subjective social status. Both pre-test groups completed the retirement consideration questionnaire, retirement planning checklist, and a questionnaire measuring four core retirement concepts. The same measures we used in the post-test. The intervention groups immediately continued with the Intervention Questionnaire (see description below). The participants in the control groups answered 30 items of the short Big Five Inventory 2. We administrated the post-test five days after the pre-test. Our final sample featured only the participants who successfully filled out the post-test within 14 days after the pre-test.\nMeasures\nThe Retirement Consideration Questionnaire was inspired by Ekerdt and his colleagues, who analyzed in detail \"workers' extended engagement with the retirement before the event\" (Ekerdt, Kosloski, & Deviney, 2000). Ekerdt et al. strived to measure the consideration given to retirement by questions that capture the awareness of the topic aiming to determine whether workers think about retirement and whether it comes up in conversation. \"They are not items that ask about planning or preparation behavior in a specific sense, and they are attitudinally neutral. The objective here is to examine whether retirement is topical.\" (Ekerdt, Kosloski, & Deviney, 2000, p. 6). The three retirement consideration questions from a nationally representative survey of persons aged 51 to 61 were as follows: How much have you thought about retirement? How much have you discussed retirement with your husband/wife/partner? How much have you discussed retirement with your friends or co-workers? We expanded these three questions, and our questionnaire consisted of eight items focused on thinking about retirement: \"I'm thinking about what I'm going to do in retirement\", \"Pensions are not a topic that needs to be addressed in advance\", \"I try to avoid the idea of a retirement\", \"Preparing for retirement in advance is unnecessary\", \"One must work on oneself to prepare for a happy and peaceful retirement\", \"People should prepare thoroughly for their retirement\", \"Even before retirement, one should be familiar with everything that one has to consider in retirement\", \"I am interested in how to retire in the best possible way.\" Participants endorsed their agreement with these items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Disagree to Agree. The internal consistency of the questionnaire was adequate: McDonald's [omega] = 0.75 for the pre-test and 0.80 for the post-test.\nRetirement planning was accessed via the modified checklist for plans used by Wang, Worsley, Cunningham, and Hunter (2014). The authors constructed The Checklist for Retirement Plans in two steps. They developed the individual items from people's accounts of their planning behaviors and then produced categories of planning through latent class analysis of their responses to those items. Age, income, problem-solving skills, attitudes toward the future, and the presence of long-term illness significantly predicted retirement planning measured by this checklist in their study. Several studies implemented The Checklist (recently Seidl et al., 2021). We adopted this checklist with all seven items on future retirement planning. However, instead of a dichotomous answer to the items (1 = no, I do not plan, and 2 = yes, I plan) used by Wang et al., we used the 5-point Likert scale items ranging from Disagree to Agree. All items shared the same stem: \"I think that before retiring person needs to plan ... \" and continued with a short phrase: \"where s/he will live\", \"how s/he will keep physically active\", and \"how s/he will keep mentally stimulated\", \"how much money s/he will need\", \"how to ensure his/her income is sufficient\", \"how s/he will meet people outside the family\", \"where s/he will go away from home, or travel to.\" The internal consistency of the questionnaire was strong: McDonald's [omega] = 0.80 for the pre-test and 0.90 for the post-test.\nParticipants' ideas and beliefs about retirement were captured by measuring the four core concepts of retirement lifestyle proposed by Hornstein and Wapner (1985) in their qualitative investigation. Inspired by the authors who translated the qualitatively identified concepts into a questionnaire (Gee & Baillie, 1999; Hanson & Wapner, 1994; Hopkins, Roster, & Wood, 2006), we accessed these concepts using 12 items created solely for the present study. Participants endorsed their agreement with these items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Disagree to Agree. Transition to Old Age was measured by three items: \"I consider retirement to be the end of all work and the enjoyment of a well-deserved rest after a lifetime of effort\", \"Retirement provides an opportunity to end your life peacefully\", and \"Retired people should no longer engage in new activities.\" The last item showed a very low correlation with other items, and the internal consistency was poor ([omega] = 0.46/0.38); therefore, it was omitted. Without this item, internal consistency became more satisfactory ([omega] = 0.59/0.46). New Beginning was accessed by three items: \"Retirement will finally be the time for me to actively pursue my interests\", \"I welcome retirement as a whole new beginning in my life\", and \"The retirement transition will give me new opportunities to take an interest in things I haven't done before.\" The internal consistency of the questionnaire was adequate ([omega] = 0.71/0.77). The Continuation concept was accessed by three items: \"My retirement life will be very similar to my life now\", \"Retirement won't make a big difference in my life\" and \"I plan to live in retirement in the same way as before retirement\". The internal consistency of the questionnaire was adequate ([omega] = 0.77/0.74). The last concept, Imposed Disruption, was accessed by three items: \"I perceive retirement as an unwanted disruption to my previous work\", \"The thought of retiring worries and scares me\", and \"It is difficult for me to cope with the fact that I will have to retire soon.\" Internal consistency was strong ([omega] = 0.82/0.83).\nIntervention Description\nWe used the Transition Guide: A New Way to Think About and Manage Change, a tool for self-scoring assessment developed by Schlossberg and Kay (2010), as an intervention that provides information on psychological preparation. The tool is available online (https://transitionguide.com).\nThe Transition Guide tool contains fifty-six items divided into four sections (Situation, Self, Supports, and Strategies; Anderson, Goodman, & Schlossberg, 2012). As a non-directive way of subtly suggesting the need for retirement preparation, we adapted, reformulated, and shortened the items in the Transition Guide so that the intervention focuses on retirement transition and consists of thirty items. We structured The Intervention Questionnaire into the following five scales: Anticipated intensity of changes induced by retirement, aimed at making participants aware of the intense changes retirement brings, whether good or bad for the participant (five items); Perceived retirement transition consisting of seven items indicating how participants see their retirement transition situation (favorable or unfavorable conditions); Perceived personal strengths (five items) reports on how participants view their strengths (positive qualities); Social support from others (six items) asks what help and support a participant expects from others; and Problem-solving strategies (seven items) shows the strategies the participants have used so far for changing things, negotiating terms, and handling difficulties.\nThe participants responded on 5-point Likert scales according to the content of the items. After each scale, the participants obtained immediate feedback--their scores for the anticipated intensity of retirement changes and the types of psychological resources they could use to cope with them. In the end, participants received an overall score on their psychological coping resources. The entire content of the Intervention Questionnaire is provided in the Appendix.\nAnalyses\nThe data were processed and analyzed using SPSS 22 and jamovi 2.2.5 software (The Jamovi Project, 2021). First, we used a two-way ANOVA to ascertain whether the posttest scores differ for the intervention and control groups, accounting for pre-test sensitization. After that, we focused on the change in the pre-test and post-test using a paired samples t-test, independently for the intervention and the control group. In addition, we analyzed the data from the Intervention Questionnaire. We also examined the connections between the post-test scores of dependent variables and the responses of the participants in the Intervention Questionnaire. Although the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality was significant for the dependent variables used, parametric tests were used considering the number of participants, continuous nature of variables, acceptable skewness and kurtosis (between -1 and 1), and visual inspection of Q-Q plots. Data are available at https://osf.io/qgfmp/?view_only=eca13f0b9c2a4fe69c424d61ff279194\nFirstly, we accessed the pre-test difference between the control and intervention groups. The results showed no significant differences between these two groups, suggesting equal pre-test scores in both groups (Cohen's d ranged from 0.04 to 0.18). Secondly, we focused on the difference between pre-test and post-test scores separately in both groups. We found significantly higher post-test scores for the New Beginning and Continuation concepts in the Intervention group, but the difference was very small for the former and small for the latter. Although we expected an increase in these concepts, it should be noted that there was a slightly lower but still significant unexpected increase in the Continuation concept in the control group as well. After applying the Holm-Bonferroni method, only the difference in Continuation in the intervention group remains significant. Interestingly, we found a small significant decrease in Retirement Planning in the control group. Table 3 presents the results.\nAnalysis of the Intervention Questionnaire\nThe intervention we used enabled us to assess how participants assess their psychological resources needed for coping with a retirement transition. We could measure how intensively the participants perceived the changes induced by their retirement, their perception of retirement situation, their strengths for adapting to change, the social support they could rely on, and the strategies they used to achieve their objectives. The McDonald's omega for the scales of the Intervention Questionnaire was as follows: Intensity of changes 0.75 (six items), Perceived transition situation 0.74 (seven items), Perceived personal strengths 0.66 (five items), Social support 0.79 (six items), Strategies used 0.65 (seven items; see all items in the Appendix).\nTable 4 presents the descriptives of the scores in the Intervention Questionnaire for the groups without and with a pre-test. There were no differences between the intervention group without and with the pre-test (Cohen's d values were insignificant and ranged from 0.05 to 0.19). Both intervention groups self-assessed their psychological resources for retirement quite highly (in the upper level of the scale ranging from 1 to 5).\nTo gain insight into the relationship between assessing one's psychological retirement resources and retirement concepts and retirement planning intention, we analyzed the relationships between the scales of the Intervention Questionnaire and the dependent variables.\nTable 5 shows that the participants who were more inclined to the retirement concept Imposed disruption perceived the changes that retirement would bring them more intensely. They also perceived their retirement transition situation as unfavorable, their strengths as insufficient, their social support as weaker, and their troubleshooting strategies as less sufficient. On the other hand, pre-retirees inclined to look at retirement as a New beginning showed a more positive perception of their retirement transition situation. They positively perceived their strengths and valued their social support. The two retirement concepts--Transition to old age and Continuation showed similar patterns, except that the Continuation concept was associated with the perception of the lower level of changes brought about by retirement.\nThe other two dependent variables--Retirement consideration and Retirement planning --positively correlated with only one scale of the Intervention Questionnaire. The more participants perceived the intensity of changes brought about by retirement, the higher their scores in the variables Retirement consideration and Retirement planning (Table 5).\nAlthough we have made every effort, including a sophisticated experimental design, there are some methodological limitations in the research arrangement in our research. The time between the pre-test, psychological information, and post-test was relatively long (up to 14 days), and this can limit the extent of capturing changes induced by the intervention.\nWe examined a sample of general pre-retirees with diverse backgrounds, and we randomly assigned them to experimental and control groups. It is a strength of the present research that it provides evidence of generalizability. However, the broad age range in the studied samples can be a limitation. As Ekerdt, Kosloski, and Deviney (2000) found the closer the retirement date, the more intense the thinking about retirement. The wide age range of our samples may also have contributed to the fact that the participants could have rejected thinking and planning for a distant retirement.\nAnother possible issue regarding the non-significant results is whether the performed tests had the satisfactory statistical power to detect meaningful changes. Sensitivity power analysis using G*Power software revealed that with a sample of 576 participants and alpha 0.05, we had 80% power to detect effects as small as f = 0.138 for ANOVA and, with groups of 311 (intervention) and 256 (control), d = 0.210 for the t-test. Both of these are small effects (Cohen, 1988), however, with some potential to be consequential for an explanation of events (Funder & Ozer, 2019). We believe that effect sizes lower that these are not meaningful in the context of the study as they would represent only minor changes in dependent variables with no practical relevance for the demonstration of variables. However, this conclusion means that low statistical power was not the problem in our study, and the identified effect sizes represent no intervention effect on retirement intentions and concepts.\nThe nature of the retirement transition also adds to this finding. Transition to retirement is ambivalent. Retirement entails both gains and losses synchronously. The pre-retiree attitudes to retirement transition may also be ambivalent. In previous studies, the participants reported retirement by apprehension and idealization (Genoe, Liechty, & Marston, 2018; Grodem & Kitterod, 2021). Also, the transition period can be relatively long and divided into sub-phases (Wanka, 2019). Different thoughts and emotions associated with retirement may be at the forefront of the future retirees' minds in the sub-phases. Some participants (especially those just over the age of 50) may have been in a phase where retirement issues still felt very far away. Some pre-retirees see retirement as a welcome event. Not all of them feel the need for preparation, and not all are comfortable with the same type of preparation.\nWe can also find help explaining the results of our participants by analyzing their answers to the questionnaires on retirement consideration and retirement planning. All participants' responses, both in the intervention and the control groups, in the pre-tests and post-tests, indicated that they acknowledged the need to plan and prepare for retirement (Table 1). It suggests that our participants may not have needed to be \"persuaded\" into doing some psychological preparation because they already seemed to be \"convinced.\"\nThe analysis of the data from the Intervention Questionnaire also provides us with a key to the results. The responses in the Intervention Questionnaire revealed that the participants thought they had been equipped for retirement psychologically (Table 4). The intervention might only reinforce the participants' pre-existing beliefs about their psychological preparedness for retirement.\nThe fact that the studied population of pre-retirees in a post-communist country still partially lives in the retirement settings of the previous regime, where retirees were taken care of by the patronizing state, may also have contributed to the failure of the intervention. Retirement used to not mean too much change in life except that they received a pension instead of a salary. Although pension was much smaller, their needs also decreased in retirement. Perhaps the same or similar intervention would have different consequences in other socio-economic and cultural settings.\nIn addition to not finding a difference between pre-test and post-test, we found several noticeable links between retirement planning and concepts (dependent variables) and the self-assessment of psychological readiness in the Intervention Questionnaire (Table 5).\nThe participants who anticipated retirement would bring them more intense changes reported a greater need to think and plan for retirement. We also found relationships between retirement concepts and self-assessment of psychological resources for managing retirement. The participants with a higher retirement concept of New Beginning anticipated a favorable transition situation and self-estimated higher personal strengths. By contrast, the participants with a higher concept of Imposed Disruption increasingly anticipated an unfavorable transition, self-estimated lower psychological strengths, and a lower level of expected social support (Table 5).\nOur non-significant findings regarding the impact of the intervention on psychological retirement preparation raise questions about whether all pre-retirees need a psychological guide well ahead of retirement age and under what conditions is psychological preparation for retirement justified. Retirement researchers have only recently become aware of the need for psychological retirement preparation. As far as we know, researchers have not yet explicitly asked questions about the necessary or selective need for psychological pre-retirement training.\nAt the same time, our results offer a key to which pre-retirees could benefit from psychological retirement preparation. They are the ones who believe they would have an adverse and unfavorable retirement transition. The next group are the ones who tend to conceptualize their retirement as an imposed disruption and who also perceived their psychological resources for a successful transition as insufficient.\nIn summary, the form of intervention we used did not increase participants' retirement planning intention nor advance their retirement concepts. However, the Intervention Questionnaire revealed that pre-retiree participants reported thinking about and planning their retirement and perceived their psychological preparedness regardless of the provided intervention.\nSeveral explanations of our non-significant results are possible, and several factors are highly likely to act here simultaneously. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the direction of future research. Some explanation for our insignificant results lies in the intervention used. Its content, form, and length of proceedings were not robust enough. Perhaps the participants knew the contents of the intervention, or it may not have been relevant enough for them for various reasons. A more detailed explanation outside the intervention itself of why the intervention was not effective includes several options as well. Future investigations should focus on determining more precisely which groups of pre-retirees could benefit from the information on the psychological aspects of retirement and why.\nThe main conclusion of our research study is that in utilizing psychological retirement preparation it is more effective to identify early the potential pre-retirement vulnerability, stimulate motivation in participants, and then create an intervention appropriate for the participant's specific needs.\nhttps://doi.org/10.31577/sp.2023.02.871\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education and the Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA) under contract No. 2/0048/18 \"The psychological aspects of the adaptation to retirement\".\nAuthors' ORCID\nViera Bacova\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-3661-208X\nMichal Kohut\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-4544-1331\nPeter Halama\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-6938-4845\nFunder, D.

Adapting to these life changes takes time and energy.\nWhat is key to a satisfactory retirement transition?\nAlthough the transition to retirement differs for each person, the steps that have to be taken are quite similar.\nExperts have developed three steps to facilitate this change. The procedure has been validated in many countries for many people of pre-retirement age.\nStep 1: Familiarize yourself with the changes that await you\nThink about how retirement will change your life. Regardless of whether the transition is positive or negative, it may stress you out. For example, you may experience feelings of loss when you leave work and your co-workers, or insecurity about your new status in the family.\nPlease indicate the extent to which you assume retirement will change your life, regardless of whether it is good or bad:\nYour score: ...\nThe closer your score is to 5, the more the retirement transition will change your life. It is therefore more important that you undergo greater psychological preparation for retirement.\nIn all cases, the following questions will help you cope with the changes retirement brings.\nStep 2: Evaluate the resources you have to cope with the changes in retirement\nEach of us has four resources that we can use:\nA. Situation (favorable or unfavorable conditions),\nB. Your personality (your positive qualities),\nC. Other people's support,\nD. Strategies for changing things, negotiating the terms, and handling the difficulties.\nBy answering the following questions, you will find out which resources you need to cope with your retirement.\nYou will find your result at the end of the questions.\n(A) For the following items, indicate how you see your retirement transition situation:\nYour score: ...\nThe closer your score is to 35, the more favorable your retirement situation is likely to be. If you score less than 14, this is a weak area.\n(B) For the following questions, indicate what you perceive your strengths to be:\nYour score: ...\nThe closer your score is to 25, the higher your chances of adjusting well to the changes that retirement brings.\nIf your score is less than 10, this is a weak area.\n(C) For the following questions, indicate what help and support you have from others:\nYour score: ...\nThe closer your score is to 30, the more support you will be able to get when you retire. If your score is less than 12, this area is weak.\n(D) For the following questions, indicate the troubleshooting strategies you use:\nYour score: ...\nThe closer your score is to 35, the more you will be able to use different strategies to achieve your goals, so you will have a better chance of adjusting to the changes that retirement brings. If your score is less than 14, this area is weak.\nSummary of your skill-set for successfully coping with the life changes brought about by retirement\nStep 3: Take responsibility for your retirement transition\nWe find it easier to get through each stage in life if we are aware of our assets and liabilities and develop an \"action plan\". Even doing just a little bit of preparation for retirement can improve your sense of well-being and control over events.\nBased on your resource summary, come up with some suggestions to improve some of the \"weaker\" areas in your retirement preparation.\nHere are some inspiring ideas on how you can prepare for and handle your retirement.\n* Strive to see the positive aspects and positive results.\n* Find out what kind of experiences other people in your profession have had with retirement.\n* Recognize that feelings of loss and grief are normal and last for a while.\nIdeas for your action plan\nWrite down three steps you can take to improve a low or medium score in one of your resource areas:\n1. ... ....\n2. ... ...\n3. ... ....\nViera Bacova [1] [ID], Michal Kohut [2] [ID], Peter Halama [1] [ID]\n[1] Institute of Experimental Psychology, Centre of Social and Psychological Sciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 841 04 Bratislava, Slovak Republic\n[2] Faculty of Philosophy and Arts, University of Trnava, Hornopotocna 23, 918 43 Trnava, Slovak Republic\nCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to Viera Bacova, Institute of Experimental Psychology, Centre of Social and Psychological Sciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 841 04 Bratislava, Slovak Republic.

        "results": "Results\nHypothesis Testing\nTable 1 presents the mean and standard deviation for each dependent variable in the compared groups. The participants rated themselves highly in all dependent variables outside the concept of Imposed disruption (in the upper half of the scale; the scales ranged from 1 to 5).\nWe conducted two-way ANOVA for each dependent variable to test our hypotheses (Table 2). The significance was compared to Holm-Bonferroni's corrected alpha for each test (Holm, 1979). The results showed that 1) the pre-test did not have a significant effect on post-test scores, 2) intervention did not have a significant effect on post-test scores, and 3) the interaction of pre-test and intervention was not significant for any of the dependent variables. Thus, regarding our hypotheses, we found that intervention did not have a significant effect on Retirement consideration, Retirement planning, New beginning, Continuation, Transition to old age, or Imposed disruption. Our results did not confirm any of the three hypotheses.\nIndependent and Dependent Samples T-Tests for Groups with Pre-Test",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe results did not confirm our hypotheses. Compared to the control groups, the intervention group did not increase their retirement consideration and planning beliefs (H1). Nor did the intervention group advance the retirement concepts of New beginning and Continuation (H2) or decrease the retirement concepts of Transition to old age and Imposed disruption (H3). We found no difference between the pre-tests and post-tests that followed the application of the intervention used. The intervention content, form, and duration were not robust enough to \"persuade\" participants to think more about retirement planning, and the one-time intervention application was not sufficient to \"nudge\" participants into advancing their retirement concepts. The only partial result in the expected direction was that the group reported higher agreement with the concept of Continuation after the psychological retirement information.\nRecent works have not observed significant effects of similar retirement interventions in financial preparation. Hoffmann and Plotkina (2020) investigated when financial information is more likely to improve retirement planning intentions and which consumers are more prone to act on their stated intentions. In a longitudinal study, they found that message format had a limited effect on message effectiveness, but the receipt of a message did improve consumers' intention to plan for retirement. The willingness to learn more about retirement planning and retirement self-efficacy mediated this effect. The authors concluded that financial information was more likely to improve retirement planning intentions when consumers' perceived financial security was low and when such message was congruent with consumers' goal mindset. Their findings were in a similar vein as our results, when the effect of providing relevant information was not sufficient enough.",

        "abstract": "How can we explain the strange behavior of quantum and relativistic entities? Why do they behave in ways that defy our intuition about how physical entities should behave, considering our ordinary experience of the world around us? In this article, we address these questions by showing that the comportment of quantum and relativistic entities is not that strange after all, if we only consider what their nature might possibly be: not an objectual one, but a conceptual one. This not in the sense that quantum and relativistic entities would be human concepts, but in the sense that they would share with the latter a same conceptual nature, similarly to how electromagnetic and sound waves, although very different entities, can share a same undulatory nature. When this hypothesis is adopted, i.e., when a conceptuality interpretation about the deep nature of physical entities is taken seriously, many of the interpretational difficulties disappear and our physical world is back making sense, though our view of it becomes radically different from what our classical prejudice made us believe in the first place.\nAuthor(s): Diederik Aerts 1 , Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi 1 2 , Sandro Sozzo 3 , Tomas Veloz 1 4\nAuthor Affiliations:\n(1) grid.8767.e, 0000 0001 2290 8069, Center Leo Apostel for Interdisciplinary Studies, Brussels Free University, , Krijgskundestraat 33, 1160, Brussels, Belgium\n(2) Laboratorio di Autoricerca di Base, , Lugano, Switzerland\n(3) grid.9918.9, 0000 0004 1936 8411, School of Management and IQSCS, University of Leicester, , University Road, LE1 7RH, Leicester, UK\n(4) Instituto de Filosof\u00eda y Ciencias de la Complejidad IFICC, , Los Alerces 3024, \u00d1u\u00f1oa, Santiago, Chile",
        "introduction": "Introduction\nIn 1924, Luis de Broglie, in his Ph.D. thesis (De Broglie 1924), made one of the boldest moves in the history of modern physics. Following Planck and Einstein's introduction of a dual particle-like aspect associated with light waves, to \"explain\" their strange behavior in certain experiments, de Broglie, reasoning in a specular way, introduced the hypothesis that a wave-like aspect should also be associated with physical entities that, until that moment, were only considered to be corpuscles, like electrons, neutrons and protons. Like all new wild ideas, physicists were initially very unsure about the value of de Broglie's hypothesis, but fortunately Langevin had the foresight to send a copy of his thesis to Einstein, who was immediately conquered by the idea, so that de Broglie was ultimately granted his doctorate. The rest is history: a few years later, Davisson and Germer in the USA, and G.P. Thomson in Scotland, confirmed by means of diffraction experiments that electrons could also behave as waves. In 1929, Louis de Broglie was then awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons, which as we know laid the foundations of quantum mechanics, and in 1937 also Davisson and Thomson received the Nobel Prize, for their historical diffraction experiments.\nThe aim of the present paper is to discuss about a more recent \"move \u00e0 la de Broglie,\" which is also the result of a specular reasoning. The starting point is the new and booming research field known as quantum cognition , where the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics was applied with unexpected success to model human concepts and their interaction with human minds, showing that we humans think and take decisions pretty much in a quantum-like way. This doesn't necessarily mean that our brains would be like quantum computers , exploiting the existence of quantum effects at the micro-level, but it certainly means that a quantum-like behavior is not the prerogative of the micro-entities, being instead a form of organization that can be found at different structural levels within our reality (Aerts and Sozzo 2015). Now, if the human conceptual entities are to be associated with a quantum-like behavior, and therefore possess a quantum nature, one can introduce the hypothesis that, the other way around, the micro-physical (quantum) entities should also be associated with a conceptual-like behavior, and therefore possess a conceptual nature similar to that of the human concepts. However, different from the wave-particle duality, the quantumness-conceptuality binomial would not be the expression of a relation of complementarity, but rather of a relation of similarity, in the sense that quantumness and conceptuality would just be two terms pointing to a same reality, or nature, which can manifest at different organizational levels within reality.\nThe above hypothesis, that quantum entities are conceptual, was proposed by one of us in 2009 (Aerts 2009, 2010a, b, 2013, 2014), and in the present work we will demonstrate its explicative power by reviewing some of the quantum situations in which it has been applied so far, among those considered to be not yet fully understood, or even not understandable. We will do the same for the interpretational difficulties of special relativity theory, thus showing that the conceptuality interpretation really represents a possible fundamental step forward in our understanding of the stuff our world is made of, and a candidate for the construction of a coherent framework for both quantum and relativity theories, and maybe also evolutionary theories (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2018). But before doing so, some words of caution are necessary. From the hypothesis that quantum entities would be conceptual entities carrying meaning and exchanging it with pieces of ordinary matter, a pancognitivist view naturally emerges (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2018), where everything within our reality participates in cognition, with human cognition being just an example of it, expressed at a specific organizational level. This, however, is not meant to be interpreted as an anthropomorphization of reality, because human cognition is to be considered as a much younger and hence still rather unsophisticated form of that more fundamental conceptual structure constituting the global reality.\nThere is also no connection at all with any type of idealistic philosophical views, where physical theories would be considered to be mere theories of human mental content. Quite on the contrary, the conceptuality interpretation is a genuine realistic view, where conceptual entities are seen as entities that can be in different states and be subjected to measurement processes, which are processes not only of discovery (of the properties that were already actual), but also of creation (of those properties that were only potential prior to the measurement and could become actual through its execution). Also, the conceptual substance forming our global reality is not even necessarily connected to the human cognition, its existence being certainly independent of it, i.e., even when us humans, as a cognitive species, had not yet come into existence on the surface of planet Earth, the fundamental conceptual substance forming our global reality was already there, because also its quantum aspects were already there. To make even more clear the realistic stance underlying our conceptuality interpretation, if the dinosaurs would not have become extinct (probably due to the impact of an asteroid) and would have further evolved their cognitive talents, they could easily have been them the first to explore the conceptual layer existing within their species, in a similar way as they might have also have been the first to discover the quantum nature of the micro world.\nHaving said this, and before proceeding in the next sections by describing how the conceptuality interpretation can explain different quantum and relativistic phenomena, it is interesting to reflect for a moment about the reasons why quantum physics has remained so far so difficult to understand, which is also the reason why so many interpretations have seen the day since it was fully formulated in the thirties of the past century. The case of relativity theory is only apparently different, as the majority of physicists seem to cultivate the belief that relativity would be well understood, or at least much better understood than quantum mechanics, which in our view is only the fruit of a misconception, as we will emphasize later in the article. A first important point to consider is that the very fact that numerous quantum interpretations still exist today can be seen as the sign that none of them has been able to provide so far those notions that would capture, in its entirety, the reality that quantum theory aims to describe, and therefore obtain a general consensus. We believe that one of the reasons for their failure is the fact that most of them only try, somehow nostalgically, to interpret the mathematical quantum formalism in terms of classical spatiotemporal notions.\nTo better explain what the fulcrum of the problem is, when one tries to understand quantum (and relativistic) entities, let us use a metaphor. During the eighteenth century, the first British settlers who landed on the Australian continent were confronted with a totally new territory, both for the uses and customs of the natives, the Aborigines, and for the mysterious flora and fauna that populated those distant lands. Among Australian animals there was one in particular that struck the imagination of the settlers. Every now and then they could see it in the vicinity of the watercourses, but being shy it was difficult to see it clearly. When they could have a glimpse of it from the front, seeing its flat beak and its two palmed feet, they probably exclaimed: \"It's a duck!\" But then, when it turned around and ran away, they realized that it had not two, but four paws, and a dense fur. So, they probably also exclaimed: \"No, it's a mole!\" And by dint of exclaiming that: \"It's a duck!..No, it's a mole!..No, it's a duck!..No, it's a mole!..\" in the end they decided to call it a duckmole ! (Our little story is of course a caricature). In other words, they baptized this odd animal with a paradoxical name, obtained by the composition of the names of two different animals. Such a designation, of a dualistic nature, was clearly only provisional, since no animal can simultaneously be a duck and a mole, and when they finally managed to observe it more closely and more attentively, they realized that it was neither, but something completely different, so finally the animal got a name of its own: platypus !1\nThe above curious anecdote was used by L\u00e9vy-Leblond (1999) to illustrate the situation of physicists at the beginning of the past century, who like the Europeans settlers were confronted with entities-the microscopic ones, such as photons and electrons-whose appearance could change depending on the experimental settings, sometimes being observed as particles (moles) and other times as waves (ducks). And again by dint of exclaiming that: \"It's a particle!.. No, it's a wave!.. No, it's a particle!.. No, it's a wave!..\" in the end they also decided to provisionally denote them waveparticles , wavicles , etc, (Bunge 1999; L\u00e9vy-Leblond and Balibar 1997), i.e., to talk about them in terms of a wave-particle duality . But in the same way a platypus is neither a duck nor a mole, and certainly not simultaneously a duck and a mole, a microscopic quantum entity is also neither a particle nor a wave, and certainly not simultaneously a particle and a wave. The waveparticle dualistic designation is in fact only the result of a fleeting observation of their behavior, and if one takes the time to observe them with more attention, it becomes clear that what they truly are is \"something else,\" something completely different from the discrete and local notion of a particle as well as from the continuous and extended notion of a wave, since both of these notions are spatial, while one of the most salient features of the microscopic quantum entities is precisely that of not being representable as entities permanently present in space (or spacetime). In other words, we know what quantum entities certainly are not: they are non-spatial entities (and more generally, as we are going to also discuss, non-spatiotemporal entities).\nHowever, knowing what a microscopic quantum entity is not, does not tell us what it is, i.e., what its nature truly is. The same was true for the previous example of the platypus: knowing what it was not, was not sufficient to determine its nature, which is the reason why a controversy lasted for quite some time among European naturalists, when they discovered the unusual characteristics of the animal.2 Understanding the nature of a quantum entity is fundamental because the behavior of a physical entity can appear to us very strange, if not incomprehensible, if we believe it is something that it is not, whereas its behavior may all of a sudden become perfectly normal and fully understandable if we can correctly identify its nature. In that respect, it is important to emphasize that a physical theory requires not only a mathematical formalism, but also a network of physical concepts coherently relating to the latter and capable of providing a meaningful physical representation of the reality the theory aims to describe (De Ronde 2016). And of course, among these physical concepts the most crucial one is that identifying the nature of the physical entities the theory is about. For instance, before the advent of quantum mechanics, the concept of particle (or corpuscle) was fundamental in order to make sense of the other notions associated with the theory (of classical mechanics), like those of position, velocity, mass, etc., which in turn were associated with specific mathematical objects in the formalism.\nSo, to make sense of quantum mechanics, the first thing one needs to do is to find a notion specifying what the nature of a micro-physical entity is. We know it is not a particle notion, or a wave notion, nor a waveparticle notion, so, what is it? The standard answer is that we don't have nothing valid at hand to represent the nature of a quantum entity, but, that's it? As Arthur Conan Doyle used to point out more than once, in his Sherlock Holmes stories, sometimes the best place to hide something is to keep it in plain sight. And according to the conceptuality interpretation, what has always been in plain sight, but precisely for that was very hard to notice, is that the notion one should use to represent the nature of a quantum entity, and make full sense of its behavior, is the very notion of concept ! In other words, human concepts would not be the only category of conceptual entities with which we humans have interacted: the so-called microscopic quantum entities would form another category of conceptual entities, much more ancient and structured than our human ones, and as soon as we reset our mental parameters and start thinking of, say, an electron, not as an object but as a conceptual entity, most of the mystery of its quantum behavior disappears, as we are now going to show by considering different physical situations.\nThe Double-Slit Experiment\nRichard Feynman used to say that the double-slit experiment has in it the heart of quantum mechanics and contains the only mystery. Certainly, it contains part of the mystery, so let us start by describing this experiment to show how it can go away, if we only start thinking of the micro-physical entities interacting with double-slit barrier-let us assume they are electrons-not as particles, or waves, but as conceptual entities. For this, we begin by recalling why the double-slit experiment is impossible to explain in any classical way. The reason is simple: the localized impacts on the detector screen seem to show that the entities in question are particle-like. On the other hand, the fringe pattern one observes, when multiple impacts are collected, reveals that what traverses the double-slit is more like a wave phenomenon, able to create interference effects (see Fig. 1). And since a wave is not a particle, and vice versa , the observed behavior of the electrons cannot be consistently explained.Fig. 1\nIn the double-slit experiment an electron source fires the electrons towards a barrier having two slits. If slits 1 is open and slit 2 is closed, the probability distribution for detecting an electron at a distance x from the center of the detection screen is [Formula omitted]. If slits 2 is open and slit 2 is closed, the probability distribution is [Formula omitted]. If both slits are open, the probability distribution [Formula omitted] is not proportional to the sum of [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted], as one would expect if the electrons were particles, but is a more complex function describing a fringe interference pattern, with the main fringe being the one at the center of the detection screen [see PDF for image]\nMore precisely, if they would be like small projectiles, then a compositional interpretation of the experiment should be possible, with the pattern of impacts obtained when both slits are open being deducible from the patterns of impacts obtained when these are opened one at a time, instead of simultaneously. This means that the probability [Formula omitted] of having an impact at a point x of the detection screen, in the situation where the two slits are open, should be given by the uniform average of the probabilities [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted] of having an impact at that same point when only slit 1 or only slit 2 are open, respectively, i.e., [Formula omitted]. But since we generally have [Formula omitted], even though the electrons appear to be corpuscular, as they leave traces on the screen in the form of point-like impacts, they cannot be such, as the obtained complex fringe pattern demonstrates. Note that the one-slit probability distributions [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted] are compatible with the hypothesis that the electrons would be entities of a corpuscular nature. It is really when both slits are simultaneously open that the distribution of impacts on the detection screen becomes incompatible with the corpuscular assumption, being no longer deducible as a uniform average of the one-slit distribution probabilities. Reasoning in probabilistic terms, there will be points x on the detection screen where the probability of observing an electron will differ sensibly from the value given by the uniform average [Formula omitted], in the sense that there will be points of overexposure [corresponding to a probability overextension : [Formula omitted]], and points of underexposure [corresponding to a probability underextension : [Formula omitted]], meaning that one has to correct the uniform average by introducing a third term I (x ), an interference contribution responsible for these overextension (constructive interference) and underextension (destructive interference) effects: [Formula omitted].\nLet us now consider the hypothesis that the electrons are conceptual entities, i.e., entities behaving in a way which is similar to how human concepts behave. And let us also assume that the measuring apparatus, and more specifically the screen detector, is an entity sensitive to the meaning carried by the electrons and able to answer questions when the latter are addressed in operational terms, i.e., by enacting them through the construction of a specific experimental arrangement. Of course, the screen detector mind-like entity does not speak our human language, and will only communicate by means of signs that are the electrons' traces of impact on its surface, which we have to correctly interpret, and for this we have to understand what is the meaning that is attached to the impacts appearing in the different positions. Now, the questions the screen-mind entity is possibly answering, by means of its \"pointillistic language,\" are here the following three: (a) \"What is a good example of an impact point of an electron passing through slit 1?\" (b) \"What is a good example of an impact point of an electron passing through slit 2?\" (c) \"What is a good example of an impact point of an electron passing through slit 1 or 2?\" These three questions can be addressed in practical terms by having only slit 1 open, only slit 2 open, and both slits open, respectively. Of course, the electron conceptual entity will then be in a state that depends on the configuration of the barrier. When only slit 1 is open, it will be in a state [Formula omitted], corresponding to the conceptual combination The electron passes through slit 1 . When only slit 2 is open, it will be in a state [Formula omitted], corresponding to the conceptual combination The electron passes through slit 2 . And when both slits are open, it will be in a state [Formula omitted], corresponding to the conceptual combination The electron passes through slit 1 or 2 .3\nIf the above states are represented by complex vectors in a Hilbert space, one can easily recover the interference pattern at the detection screen by representing [Formula omitted] as a normalized superposition of [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted], i.e., [Formula omitted]. Then, the probability density [Formula omitted] [resp., [Formula omitted]] that the screen-mind provides the answer x to question (a) [resp., (b)] is [Formula omitted] [resp., [Formula omitted]], whereas the probability density for x to be selected as a good example of an electron passing through slit 1 or 2 [question (c)] is: [Formula omitted], where [Formula omitted] is the interference contribution, accounting for the overextension and underextension effects, and the symbol [Formula omitted] denotes the real part of a complex number. This is of course the well-known quantum mechanical rule saying that when we are in the presence of alternatives (slit 1 or 2), the probability amplitude is obtained by the normalized sum of the probability amplitudes for the alternatives considered separately. But what we want now to understand is the emergence of this fringe pattern from the conceptuality hypothesis viewpoint. In other words, we want to understand the cognitive process operated by the detection screen, when viewed as a mind-like entity answering the above three questions.\nFirst of all, we have to observe that such cognitive process cannot be deterministic. Indeed, the specification \"passing through a slit\" is not sufficient to describe a unique trajectory in space. This is so also because being the electron a conceptual entity, it cannot be attached with a priori spatial properties. These will have to be acquired by interacting with the apparatus, so as to give a sense to the very notion of \"passing through.\" And since there are many ways in which a spatial entity is able to pass through a slit, the screen-mind will have to choose from among several possibilities, and choosing one among these possibilities is a symmetry breaking process whose outcomes cannot be predicted in advance, which is the reason why every time the question is asked the answer (the trace of the impact on the screen) can be different. However, answers cannot be totally arbitrary, as is clear that the question specifies that the electron passes, for example in case of question (a), through slit 1. So, the screen-mind will certainly manifest a greater propensity to respond by means of an impact point located in a position in proximity of slit 1, which means that the symmetry breaking process will be a weighted one, with some outcomes having greater probability than others (more will be said about measurements in Sect. 9). Of course, things get more interesting when we consider question (c), as in this situation not only there are many possibilities about how the electron will pass through either slit, but also about which slit, 1 or 2, it will pass through. Confronted with this situation, the screen-mind will thus have to select those answers that best express this double level of uncertainty, producing an impact point that will be typical of an electron conceptual entity having acquired spatial properties and passing through slit 1 or 2. And when the question is operationally asked several times, the result will be the typical fringe structure shown in Fig. 1.\nLet us delve into the screen-mind to try to understand how such fringe structure can emerge. For this, let us concentrate on its most salient feature: the central fringe, which is the one with a higher density of impacts, located at equal distance from the two slits. This is where the screen-cognitive entity is most likely to manifest an answer, when subjected to question (c). To understand why, we can observe that an impact in the region of the central fringe corresponds to a situation of maximum doubt regarding the slit the electron would have used to cross the barrier, or even the fact that it would necessarily have passed through one or the other slits, in an exclusive manner. Therefore, it constitutes a perfect exemplification, in the form of an impact point on the screen, of the concept \"an electron passing through slit 1 or 2.\" Now, if the region in between the two slits is a region of overextension, the two regions opposite the two slits are instead regions of underextensions, showing a very low density of impacts. To understand why, we can observe that an impact in the regions facing the two slits would not make us doubt about the slit through which the electron has passed. In other words, an impact point in the two regions opposite the slits would constitute a very bad exemplification of the concept \"an electron passing through slit 1 or 2.\" Moving then from these two regions away from the center, we will be back again in a situation of doubt, although less perfect than that expressed by the central region, so regions of overextension will manifest again, but this time less intense, and then again regions of underextension will come, and so on, producing in this way the typical fringe pattern observed in experiments.\nConsidering the above conceptuality explanation of the double-slit experiment, we see that the wave aspect associated with electrons (mathematically described by the wave function [Formula omitted], evolving according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation), is just a convenient way to model, by means of constructive and destructive interference effects, the different overextension and underextension effects that result from the cognitive (symmetry breaking process) through which a good (concrete) exemplar for an abstract conceptual entity is each time provided, when the interrogative context forces the electronic conceptual entity to enter the spatiotemporal theater, by means of a localized impact on the screen. Of course, this impact should not be mistaken as a trace left by a corpuscular entity with a well-defined trajectory in space, as it will be better explained in the following sections. Now, to confer more credibility to the above narrative, and considering that an electron and a human concept are assumed to share the same conceptual nature (in the same way an electromagnetic wave and an acoustic wave, even though they are different physical phenomena, can share the same wavy nature), one should be able to also show that human minds are able of producing similar interference figures, when subjected to interrogative contexts that confront them with genuine alternatives. This is indeed the case: human minds, when interacting with concepts, will generally produce overextension and underextension effects having a very complex pattern, in fact much more complex (less symmetric) than those produced by screen-minds interacting with electrons (or photons). Let us very briefly describe an experiment where this has been explicitly demonstrated, referring the interested reader to Aerts (2009) and Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi (2017a) for the details.\nIn the eighties of last century, the cognitive psychologist James Hampton conducted an experiment where 24 exemplars of Food 4 were submitted to 40 students, asking them if they were typical (i.e., good examples) of a (a) Fruit ; (b) Vegetable or (c) Fruit or vegetable (Hampton 1988). These different exemplars of Food play here the same role as the different locations x on the detection screen, in the double-slit experiment, with the concept Fruit (resp. Vegetable ) playing the role of slit 1 (resp., slit 2). If the decision-making process of the students, when subjected to question (c), would be of a sequential kind (they first choose between Fruit and Vegetable and then, if they chose the former, they select a good example of Fruit , and if they chose the latter, they select a good example of Vegetable ), then the probability of selecting a given exemplar of Food should correspond to the uniform average of the probabilities describing the situations of questions (a) and (b). But this is not what Hampton's data reveal, which contain instead a complex pattern of overextension and underextension effects. When these data are represented in a quantum-like way, using two two-dimensional functions interpolating the outcomes of questions (a) and (b), then a normalized superposition of these two functions to interpolate the data of question (c), a complex interference figure is revealed, reminiscent of those obtained in the phenomena of birefringence (Aerts 2009; Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2017a) (see Fig. 2).Fig. 2\nThe interference-like figure describing the overextension and underextension effects contained in Hampton's data, when the participants had to select exemplars representative of the disjunction Fruit or vegetable. For more details about how this figure was obtained, see Aerts (2009) [see PDF for image]\nWe conclude this section by an important remark. In our discussion, we made a distinction between the detector screen, playing the role of the structure sensitive to the meaning carried by the electrons, and the barrier, playing the role of the structure allowing the three questions (a), (b) and (c) to be addressed in operational terms, when slit 1, slit, 2, and both slits are open, respectively. This distinction is however not fundamental and was just used to obtain a stronger analogy with our typical human experience, when we distinguish the mind answering a question from the process of addressing a question to it, for instance orally or in writing. In fact, the entire structure of the experimental apparatus should really be interpreted as the mind-like entity, as is clear that not only the screen but also the other material parts, in particular the barrier, interact as a whole with the electrons' conceptual entities. So, a more correct image consists in saying that the structure of the entire apparatus mind-like entity changes depending on the question that is being asked. More precisely, the effect of asking question (a) [resp., (b) and (c)] is the opening of slit 1 (resp., slit 2 and both slits) at the level of the barrier, and the actual answering of the question is the process of having the electron conceptual entity entering it and leaving a trace on the detector screen.\nHaving analyzed the double-slit experiment, we want to consider in the next section another paradigmatic quantum experiment that remains impossible to understand if one does not give up the prejudice that the micro-physical entities would be particles or waves, i.e., spatiotemporal phenomena, and becomes instead very easy to explain if one assumes that they are conceptual (meaning) entities.\nDelayed-Choice Experiment\nIn 1978, Wheeler considered the following experiment (Wheeler 1978). A quantum entity, say an electron, enters an apparatus like the previously described double-slit one, with the difference that its arrangement can be changed at the last moment, before the electron is finally detected. The variable arrangements that are considered are two: a wave arrangement, like the one used in a typical double-slit experiment, which gives rise to overextension and underextension effects, and a particle arrangement, corresponding to the situation where the detection screen is removed and replaced by a second detection screen, located at a greater distance, so that the impacts detectable on it become compatible with a classical particle-like description (no overextension or underextension effects); see Fig. 3. More precisely, since the apparatus cause the wave function's components coming from the two slits to diverge, they will not anymore superimpose when they arrive at the place where the second (fixed) screen is present, so that the traces of the impacts on it allow to determine with no ambiguity the wave function component they are associated with, i.e., which path was followed by the electron, if interpreted as a particle. The experimental setting is however such that the arrangement can be changed extremely rapidly, and the result of the many experiments so far conducted is that though the arrangement is changed at the very last moment, the electrons (or any other micro-physical quantum entities) behave as if it was present since the very beginning.Fig. 3\nA schematic diagram of a delayed choice experiment, where one of the two detection screens is removable, so that a wave-like or particle-like context can be created by either leaving it in place or removing it, respectively. The lens element close to the double-slit barrier makes the wave function components coming from the two slits to slightly diverge, so there will be relevant interference effects only at the location of the removable screen, but not at the more distant location of the fixed screen. This means that the latter will not show a fringe pattern, but only two distinct and equivalent regions of impact, which can be associated with electrons emerging either from slit 1 or from slit 2 [see PDF for image]\nExperiments of this kind (see for instance Jacques et al. 2007) demonstrate the inadequacy of the wave-particle duality. As a matter of fact, if the electron quantum entity would behave as a wave (i.e., as a spatial entity passing through both slits) or as a particle (i.e., as a spatial entity passing either through slit 1 or slit 2), depending on the experimental arrangement, then, when the latter is changed at the last moment, the electron (assumed to be an entity propagating through space) should have left already the double-slit barrier region, and the delayed change should not be able to affect its prior wave or particle behavior. This however is not what is observed in the experiments, where everything happens as if the electron would have \"delayed its choice\" (from which the name that was given to these experiments) of manifesting either as a wave-like phenomenon or as a particle-like phenomenon, until the final arrangement is decided. Facing the implications of these experiments, Wheeler famously affirmed the following (Wheeler 1978): \"Then let the general lesson of this apparent time inversion be drawn: No phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon. In other words, it is not a paradox that we choose what shall have happened after it has already happened. It has not really happened, it is not a phenomenon, until it is an observed phenomenon.\"\nIf by \"phenomenon\" we understand a \"spatial phenomenon,\" then we can only agree with Wheeler's statement, which indicates that we cannot understand the behavior of an electron by depicting it as a spatial entity, be it a wave, a particle, or a waveparticle. In other words, what these experiments show is that electrons, and any other micro-physical entities, are non-spatial entities: when the gun fires an electron towards the double slit barrier, one should not imagine it as a wave or a particle propagating in space, but as a more abstract entity that is only drawn into space at the moment of its actual detection, either by the removable screen or by the fixed screen, depending on the final selection. Of course, the electron exists also prior to its detection, though not as an entity having already acquired spatiotemporal properties. Again, this is typical of the behavior of a conceptual entity whose state can change from a more abstract to a more concrete one, when interacting with a (mind-like) structure sensitive to the meaning it carries.\nLet us consider once again the conceptuality hypothesis, to see how the apparent delayed choice behavior of the electron becomes not only perfectly understandable, but also corresponds to what we would expect. As described in the previous section, the question that is being asked is: \"What is a good example of an impact point of an electron passing through slit 1 or 2?\" An answer to this question will be manifested either by the removable screen-mind, if maintained in place, or by the fixed screen-mind, if the former has been removed. These two cognitive entities, however, will encounter the electrons' conceptual entities in different states, because of their distinct spatial locations. From the perspective of the removable screen, which is closer to the double-slit barrier, the converging lens has no relevant effects, so the state [Formula omitted] of the electrons can be conveniently described by the conceptual combination: The electron passes through slit 1 or 2 . On the other hand, since the converging lens produces a relevant effect for the farther away fixed screen, it will interact with the electrons in a different state [Formula omitted], which can be described by the conceptual combination: The electron passes through slit 1 or 2 and is subsequently strongly deviated from its trajectory by a converging lens . These states being different, the meaning carried by the electron in the two situations is also different, so that the removable screen-mind will answer the question in the way described in the previous section, with a complex fringe pattern having a central major fringe, whereas the fixed screen will answer by randomly considering either an upper spot, associated with slit 2, or a lower spot, associated with slit 1 (see Fig. 3).\nBut why now a central spot is not anymore a good exemplar for expressing the doubt regarding which slit an electron has passed through? The reason is simple to understand: because of the presence of the converging lens, and the distance of the fixed screen, the state [Formula omitted] of the electron can now be described, in more synthetic terms, by the conceptual combination: The electron passes through slit 1 either/or 2 . In other words, the \"or\" has been replaced by an exclusive-or (xor), conveying the meaning that the electron can pass through slit 1 or slit 2, but not through both of them. So, the fixed screen has to answer the same question of the removable screen, but with the additional information that the electrons do not pass through both slits simultaneously. This means that a central point on the screen will not be anymore a good example of the situation, as a central point expresses a much deeper form of doubt: one where not only we don't know the slit through which the electron has passed through, but also if it has passed through only one of them or both of them. Now, since the slit through which the electron passes through remains unspecified, the only option for the fixed screen-mind, to answer consistently, is to produce a point impact either in a location compatible with the situation of an electron passing through slit 1, 50% of the times, or in a location compatible with the situation of the electron passing through slit 2, the other 50% of the times, which is exactly what is observed in experiments. Using again the Hilbert space formalism, we now have: [Formula omitted], i.e., the two alternatives are non-interfering, compatibly with a classical (compositional) description.\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Relations\nComing back for a moment to the wave-particle duality, and assuming that an interference pattern would be indicative of a wave, and the absence of it would be indicative of a particle, experiments like the one described in the previous section are usually interpreted by saying that the behavior of a quantum entity, like an electron, is determined by the type of measurement we perform on it. This is certainly correct, but only if we understand that the determination arises in the moment the quantum entity is actually detected, and not before, and this also means that if we do not want to abandon a realistic view of our physical reality, we have to accept that a micro-physical entity, prior to its detection, is usually neither in a wave nor in a particle state, but in a condition that cannot be associated with any specific spatial property. The de Broglie-Bohm theory can certainly offer an alternative description here, as it assumes that a quantum entity is the simultaneous combination of both aspects: a particle and a (pilot) wave (Norsen 2006). However, if considered as a tentative to preserve spatiality, the theory, as is well-known, faces a serious problem when dealing with more than a single entity, as the pilot wave (or quantum potential) cannot then be described as a spatial phenomenon, hence the interpretational problem remains, and in a sense get even worse.\nIf we understand conceptual entities as meaning entities that can be in different states (each state specifying the actual meaning carried by the conceptual entity), which can change either in a predictable way, when they are subjected to deterministic contexts, or in an unpredictable way, when they are subjected to indeterministic ones, like interrogative (measurement) contexts, it immediately follows that, by definition of what a state is, a conceptual entity in a given state cannot be at the same time in another, different state. We are of course stating the obvious, but this is really what is at the foundation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Consider the human concept Animal . When we use a single word to indicate this concept, we can say that it describes the most abstract of all its states, associated with a perfectly neutral (tautological) context, just conveying the meaning that: The animal is an animal . Let us look right away at a parallel between the human concept Animal and a micro-physical entity like an electron, which according to the conceptuality interpretation also possesses a conceptual nature. Non-relativistic quantum theory does not describe in formal terms the state of an electron in the condition of just being an electron. We usually describe an electron in contexts were the electron has already acquired some more specific properties, which in the theory are mathematically described by the given of a (Hilbert space) vector, or a density matrix.\nConsider then the following concepts: Dog , Cat , Horse , etc. They are all specific examples of Animal , hence, they specify different possible states of the animal-concept, and more precisely the states conveying the meanings: The animal is a dog , The animal is a cat , The animal is a horse , etc. In other words, the concept Animal can be in different states and the above are of course still examples of very abstract states, if compared to states that are determined by contexts that put for instance the Animal concept in a one-to-one relation with a well-defined entity of our spatiotemporal theater. So, the conceptual combinations: The Labrador dog named Esmerelda owned by actress Anne Hathaway , Cameron Diaz' white cat named Little Man , The race horse named Lexington who set a record at the Metaire Course in New Orleans , etc., are much more concrete states of the concept Animal . A concept can thus be in different states, but certainly cannot simultaneously be in two different states, and some states are maximally abstract, others maximally concrete, and in between there are states (the majority of them) whose degree of abstraction is intermediary, like for instance the state described by the conceptual combination: A cat owned by a celebrity (Mervis and Rosch 1981; Rosch 1999). This means that a concept cannot be in a state that is maximally abstract and at the same time maximally concrete, and this is nothing but the conceptuality version of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. (see Fig. 4).Fig. 4\nA schematic diagram describing the localized in space versus localized in momentum (opposite) directions which, according to the conceptuality interpretation, correspond to the concrete versus abstract directions [see PDF for image]\nIn the case of an entity like an electron, a maximally concrete state corresponds to the electronic entity being maximally localized in our three-dimensional space, while a maximally abstract state corresponds to it being maximally delocalized, i.e., to an electron being maximally localized in momentum space. In handbooks of quantum mechanics, Heisenberg uncertainty principle is usually stated by using the standard deviations of two non-commuting observables, like the position q and momentum p observables. The typical result is that the product [Formula omitted] of their standard deviations must be bounded from below by a given value, for instance [Formula omitted]. The standard deviation [Formula omitted] has here to be interpreted as a measure of the degree of concreteness of the state in which the electron micro-entity is, with [Formula omitted] corresponding to a condition of maximum concreteness (i.e., maximum localization in position space) and [Formula omitted] of minimum concreteness. Similarly, [Formula omitted] has to be interpreted as a measure of the degree of abstractness of the state in which the electron is, with [Formula omitted] corresponding to a condition of maximum abstractness (i.e., maximum localization in momentum space) and [Formula omitted] of minimum abstractness. It is then clear that the product [Formula omitted] must be bounded from below, as we cannot have simultaneously a situation of maximum concreteness ([Formula omitted]) and maximum abstractness ([Formula omitted]), or situations where concreteness (resp., abstractness) would be maximal and abstractness (resp., concreteness) would be intermediary (i.e, with a finite standard deviation). However, the product [Formula omitted] should be also bounded from above, as we cannot simultaneously have a situation of minimum concreteness ([Formula omitted]) and minimum abstractness ([Formula omitted]), or situations where concreteness (resp., abstractness) would be minimal and abstractness (resp., concreteness) would be intermediary (i.e., with a finite standard deviation). And in fact, a reverse version of Heisenberg's uncertainty relations can also be derived, as was recently done (Mondal et al. 2017), in accordance with what the conceptuality interpretation indicates.\nExplaining Non-spatiality (Non-locality)\nAccording to the above discussion, Heisenberg's (direct and reversed) uncertainty relations should not be considered to be the result of a lack of precision about how observables are measured in the laboratory, or the fact that measurements can alter the state of the measured entity (as was initially considered by Heisenberg in his semiclassical microscope reasoning). They would instead be an ontological statement describing the necessary tradeoff between concreteness and abstractness, resulting from the fact that, at the ontological level, quantum entities would be conceptual (meaning) entity. So, the non-locality of a micro-entity like an electron, which should be more properly denoted non-spatiality , would express the fact that most of the electron's states are abstract ones (with different degrees of abstractness), with the subset of the maximally concrete ones only corresponding to those describing specific localizations in space. Accordingly, the classical notion of object (here understood as a spatiotemporal entity) corresponds to a conceptual entity that can remain for a sufficiently prolonged time in a maximally concrete state, which means that objects (classical entities) would just be limit cases of conceptual entities immersed in deterministic contexts that allow them to remain maximally concrete for a long time.\nA possible criticism of the above explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty relations would be that there is nothing truly fundamental in our human distinction between abstract and concrete concepts, as is clear that what we call concrete concepts are precisely those associated with the objects we have interacted with, in the course of our evolution on the surface of this beautiful \"pale blue dot.\" It is certainly true that physical objects have played an important role in the way we humans have formed our language and have created more abstract concepts, for instance when in the need of indicating an entire category of objects instead of just a member of a category. So, in this human historical line of going from the concrete to the abstract, the most concrete concepts are those specifying spatiotemporal entities (objects), like in the conceptual combination: This item that I'm presently holding in my hands , and the most abstract ones are those indicated by terms like Entity , Thing , Stuff , etc., with all the other concepts lying in between them, as regards their degree of abstractness/concreteness (see Fig. 5). This human (parochial) line is the one typically considered in semiotics and psychology, which is the reason why psychologists use the term instantiation to denote a more concrete form (a more concrete state) of a given concept. This term mostly refers to the actualization in time of an exemplar of a more abstract concept, like when Apple is chosen as an exemplar of Fruit , but of course one could also use the term spatialization (or spatiotemporalization ), in addition to instantiation, when the exemplar in question is an object also existing in space. One should however bear in mind that a human concept, even when indicating an ordinary object, is not an object, and vice versa , a physical object is not a human concept, although the latter can be put in a correspondence with the former and the former, according to the conceptuality interpretation, is a conceptual entity in a maximally concrete state.Fig. 5\nFor human concepts there are two main lines connecting abstract to concrete. The first one goes from concrete to abstract: from objects to collections of objects having common features. The second one goes from abstract to concrete: from concepts to stories formed by the combination of many concepts [see PDF for image]\nSo, there is a parochial line to go from the concrete to the abstract, linked to the historical way we have developed concepts (starting from our need to name the physical entities around us), by abstracting them from objects, and there is a second line (Aerts 2014), going from the abstract to the concrete, linked to how we humans have learned to combine concepts (in order to better think and communicate), creating more complex emergent meanings (see Fig. 5). In this second line, the more abstract concepts are those that are expressible by single words, and concreteness increases when the number of conceptual combinations increases, so that the most concrete concepts are those typically described by large aggregates of meaning-connected (entangled) single-word concepts, which is what in our human realm we would generically indicate as stories , like those written in books, articles, webpages, etc. We don't mean here stories only in the reductive sense of novels, but in the more general sense of clusters of concepts that are combined together in an interesting way, so as to create a well-defined meaning. This second line is therefore very different from the previous one (in a sense, it is transversal to it), and we humans clearly use both lines at the same time, when communicating and creating new meanings. However, it is this second line that we believe is the truly fundamental and universal one, i.e., the one in which the human concepts have found their natural developmental niche.\nThe fact that in human language both lines exist and are mixed together can explain in part the fact that there are structural differences between our human conceptual realm and the micro-physical conceptual realm, in particular the fact that the latter will generally exhibit a higher level of symmetry and organization (another reason being that our human cultural evolution is a recent happening relative to the time scale of our universe). Now, consider a document containing a text, and assume that the text contains the word \"horse.\" This means that the story in such document is a (deterministic) context specifying a state of the concept Horse , which according to the second line of concretization would be a very concrete state. Of course, this same document can also be considered to describe the state of concepts indicated by other words in the story, or even concepts whose words are not specifically mentioned but are nevertheless strongly meaning-connected to its content. It is worth emphasizing that this document, containing a story about Horse , is not necessarily associated with a physical horse that one can touch and ride (an instantiation of Horse , according to the first line of concretization). For instance, the text may refer to the drawing of a horse, which of course is not a living entity, or maybe the term \"horse\" is only used in a metaphorical way, like in the Italian saying \"la superbia va a cavallo e torna a piedi\" (pride rides a horse and walks back). However, since the document contains a whole story, the latter will behave in the conceptual realm in a way that is similar to how macro-physical objects also behave.\nTo explain what we mean, consider two objects, let us call them object-A and object-B. When we consider the conceptual combination Object-A and object-B (using the 'and' logical connective),5 we are still able to put it in a correspondence with an object, and more precisely the object that is obtained by bringing together the two objects, now forming a single composite object (let us call it object-A[Formula omitted]B). On the other hand, when we consider the conceptual combination Object-A or object-B (using the 'or' logical connective), we are not able anymore to associate it with an object. But if we have two concepts, let us call them Concept-A and Concept-B , then not only Concept-A and concept-B is again a concept, but also Concept-A or concept-B is a concept. So, the conceptual realm is closed with respect to the conjunction and disjunction connectives, whereas the realm of objects is by definition only closed with respect to the conjunction connective (the conjunction of two objects is still an object, but the disjunction of two objects is not anymore an object).\nWhat about stories, i.e., conceptual entities that are formed by large combinations of concepts that are connected through meaning? Of course, since a story is still a concept, and more precisely a concept that is obtained by consistently combining numerous other concepts, as described by the specific combination of words that are present in a document (like a book, a webpage, etc.) that makes the story manifest, the above must still hold: if we have two stories, let us call them Story-A and Story-B , then also Story-A and story-B and Story-A or story-B are to be considered stories. But the subtle point is in the distinction between the notion of story as a concept (i.e., a meaning entity) and the possibility for a story to be also manifest in concrete form in our spatial theater. Consider two actual books, let us call them book-A and book-B, with book-A containing the words of Story-A , and book-B containing the words of Story-B . What about the books associated with the two stories Story-A and story-B and Story-A or story-B ? Let us call them book-A[Formula omitted]B and book-A[Formula omitted]B, respectively. The former can simply be considered as the juxtaposition of book-A and book-B, which means that as soon as two books exist, each one telling a different story, then also the book containing the conjunction of their two stories can be considered to exist, and to correspond to the book obtained by placing the two books side by side. In other words, when looking at the shelves of a bookstore, with the different books placed in them side by side, we are actually contemplating stories that are conjunctions of other stories.\nThe situation is different when we consider the disjunction of two stories. In a bookstore, we will usually not find books of the form book-A[Formula omitted]B. This not because it would be difficult to create an object of this kind, in our material world. Indeed, to do so, we only have to create a single page having the word \"or\" written on it, then consider the juxtaposition of book-A, such page, and book-B. But the probability to find an artifact of this kind in a bookstore is extremely low, and this because in our human culture it would not be considered to be the manifestation (the collapsed state) of a meaningful story, as is clear that for two arbitrary stories, Story-A and Story-B , the ambiguity introduced by the Or connective will be considered to be too artificial for Story-A or story-B to deserve to be engraved in a concrete document. To put it in a different way, in general the Or connective in Story-A or story-B will not provide a sufficiently strong meaning-connection for Story-A or story-B to be able to also appear in a bona fide book that humans can buy in bookstores. In other words, although in theory book-A[Formula omitted]B, telling Story-A or story-B , can be easily physically created, it will only appear with a very small probability within the field of our human cultural activity. The above does not mean, however, that stories that are disjunctions of other stories will not appear in documents that are part of our human culture. This will be the case of all texts that, for narrative reasons, require to specifically introduce such an aspect of two storylines that are told one after the other, with a disjunction in between. A typical example would be that of a detective story, in which different scenarios are told as possible solutions of a crime. Note that as we consider smaller pieces of texts, disjunctions will appear much more frequently, like in sentences of the \"coffee or tea\" and \"dead or alive\" kind.\nSo, different from the disjunctions of stories, conjunctions of stories are in a much more obvious (concrete) way stories again, and this difference in behavior of stories in relation to the And and Or connectives indicates their special status as elements of greater concreteness of a conceptual realm. And in the same way as objects that are conjunction of other objects need more space to manifest in our spatial theater, stories that are conjunctions of other stories also need more \"space\" to manifest, i.e., more pages, more words, more memory on a computer, in case they would be electronic documents, etc. However, different from the ordinary objects, there is not yet for our human stories the equivalent of a well-structured spatial realm, and surely there are many different ways of defining the embryonic structure from which a more organized and symmetric environment might 1 day emerge.\nAs a paradigmatic example, consider that specific collection of human stories that we have called the World Wide Web. Its interlinked webpages can be understood as the possible spatiotemporal manifestations of a rather complex abstract entity of meaning (formed by the combination of multiple concepts), whose full description requires the use of the quantum formalism (or even more general quantum-like formalisms). This perspective was recently considered in some detail as a way to capture the full meaning content of collections of documental entities, and the name QWeb was proposed to denote such meaning entity, to distinguish it from the spatiotemporal Web of written pages (Aerts et al. 2017a). The QWeb, as a quantum-meaning entity, can be in different states: some of them will be more abstract, others more concrete, the most concrete ones being the stories associated with the different printable webpages. We can thus consider the entire collection of interlinked webpages as the equivalent of our three-dimensional Euclidean space, understood as a theater for those (classical) entities we call objects. In other words, we can consider the Web's collection of documents at a given moment of our human cultural history to be the equivalent (or rather, the embryonic version) of the possible spatial locations that micro and macro physical entities can occupy, be it in ephemeral or more permanent ways.\nThis means that we interpret the different stories associated with the different webpages as the equivalent of the spatial states to which the QWeb entity (or some of its sub-conceptual entities) can transition to, in given experimental contexts, like for instance the interrogative context where a human inserts the word \"horse\" in the Google search engine, to obtain, as a result, a story about Horse , among the different possible ones. Such a search experiment can be considered to be the equivalent of a quantum measurement, although of course the parallel is not complete, as is clear that search engines like Google still operate today in a deterministic way, whereas quantum measurements are genuinely indeterministic, as the decision processes operated by humans also probably are (see Sect. 9). But we can certainly consider in our parallel a future versions of search engines, also integrating in their functioning probabilistic processes (i.e., some level of randomness), and in any case even today a human is always presented with a collection of possible results, ordered according to their relevance, and s/he has thus to decide on which of the obtained list of links to click, introducing in this way an element of unpredictability in the process.\nBefore continuing with the discussion, let us stress again the double status of webpages: they have acquired the status of objects in our human world, as it is the case for all human artifacts, but they also describe complex conceptual combinations (what we have called stories) that correspond to the most concrete states of the QWeb conceptual entity. But not all human artifacts are necessarily associated with maximally concrete states of concepts, according the second line of concretization depicted in Fig. 5. For instance, a piece of paper with the single word \"horse\" written on it, is an entity in a maximally concrete state according to the first line (it is an object), but not an entity in a maximally concrete state according to the second line (it is not a story).6 Having said that, we immediately see that a concept like Animal , say in the state The animal is a horse , which as we discussed can be considered to be a fairly abstract state, entertains a strong meaning-connection with a number of webpages, for instance all those containing the word \"horse,\" and this means that the conceptual entity Animal is potentially present in all these webpages, i.e., in all these clusters of meanings that are stories about Horse and which can be selected in an experiment consisting in finding a good example of a horse story. But since a conceptual entity can only be in a state at once, for as long as a webpage is not selected, we cannot say it is actually present in space (and time), as for this it has to acquire, at a given moment, one of the states belonging to the Web spatial canvas of states.\nWe thus have here an interesting explanation of non-locality. First of all, as highlighted in many works even before the conceptuality interpretation was proposed, non-locality means non-spatiality (Aerts 1998, 1999). Our three-dimensional Euclidean space (or more generally our four-dimensional Minkowskian space, possibly also curved by gravity) should not be considered the overall theater of our physical reality, but 'a space' that emerged following the structuring of the macro-physical entities that grew out of the micro-ones. The conceptuality interpretation adds however an important piece of explanation, regarding how we should understand this notion of non-spatiality: non-spatiality means abstractness . More precisely, non-locality and non-spatiality would result from the fact that the micro-physical entities being conceptual entities, stories (complex combinations of concepts) can form out of them, with coherence (the structuring element for their formation) being nothing than the expression of a meaning-connection, exactly in the same way as, in the human conceptual realm, stories, and in particular webpages, originate and are structured through the meaning contained in individual and collective worldviews. And these meanings, connecting the more abstract concepts to the more concrete ones, explain why quantum conceptual entities are always available in acquiring spatial properties, by lending themselves to be detected by the physical apparatuses that belong to that semantic space (the Euclidean space) which is a theater for their stories.\nConsider a story mentioning an Animal at different places in its narrative. Imagine that, at some moment, the Animal gets specified as being a Horse , i.e., the Animal concept in the story enters The animal is a horse state. Then, in no time, it will become a Horse everywhere else in the story, where it was referred to as Animal , which is precisely what happens in experiments when entities separated in space by large distances are observed to simultaneously change their states in a correlated way.\nObjects as Limit of Concepts\nIt follows from the discussion above that what we usually call objects (classical entities having stable spatiotemporal properties) would be nothing but conceptual entities having reached the status of full-fledged stories, i.e., of sufficiently complex combinations of meaning-interconnected concepts. Again, we stress the importance of not confusing artifacts containing human stories (like printed webpages) with the fact that these human artifacts, as macroscopic material entities, are in turn story-like non-human conceptual entities. The notion of object, as used in classical physics, would then be only an idealization, as the object behavior would only depend on the conceptual/cognitive environment in which an entity is immersed. Consider the example of O'Connell mechanical resonator (a small 60 [Formula omitted] flap, large enough to be seen with the naked eyes) which they succeeded putting in a superposition of two classically mutually exclusive states, one \"vibrating a little\" and the other \"vibrating a lot\" (O'Connell 2010). As another example, consider the experiment performed by Gerlich et al., where organic molecules formed by up to 430 atoms, with maximum sizes of up to 60 angstrom, were successfully put in a superposition of states localized in regions of space separated by distances of orders of magnitude larger than the molecules' sizes (Gerlich et al. 2011). Experiments of this kind indicate that also big material entities, like chairs and tables, could in principle enter non-spatial states. Take a chair. If, at a fundamental level, it is also a story-conceptual entity, then it can be in different conceptual states. The most neutral one is simply the state expressing it existence, which we can describe by the conceptual combination The chair is a chair , or The chair exists . Other states of the chair-conceptual entity are easy to encounter in our human environment, like the state: The chair is in the bedroom or The chair is in the livingroom . These are eigenstates relative to the contexts where chairs are usually found. But in principle, and although this may well never be in our reach in experimental terms, one could also create interrogative contexts, like those considered by Gerlich et al. for the organic molecules, where a chair's state would be described for instance by the conceptual combination: The chair is in the bedroom or in the livingroom .\nThe enormous difficulty in obtaining in practice a state of this kind is due to the fact that a chair is a very complex object, i.e., a very complex story, formed by numerous sub-stories, and that to put an entity of this level of complexity in a state of superposition is about finding a way to decompose such story into what can be described as the disjunction of two different stories: one corresponding to the chair being in the spatial state The chair is in the bedroom , and the other one corresponding to that same chair being in the spatial state The chair is in the livingroom .7 So, to obtain a state like The chair is in the bedroom or in the livingroom , for a macroscopic material entity like a chair, an experimental setting playing the role of a mind-like cognitive entity needs to be put in place, able to consistently decompose its meaning in a way that we would precisely describe as the disjunction of two different chair-stories (without destroying the chair-entity). Note that human minds can easily create such an interrogative context, when they express a lack of knowledge about where the chair actually is, and formulate such uncertainty-ambiguity situation using the \"or\" connective, i.e., producing a more abstract state.8 This means that within the human conceptual realm, human minds can easily provide a context/interface that can interact with a chair-entity in a conceptual way, i.e., put it in a superposition state that they can subsequently collapse, when some additional knowledge is acquired. This should not be misinterpreted, however, as human minds objectively collapsing the physical chair, as considered in 'consciousness causes collapse' interpretations like the von Neumann-Wigner. Again, we have not to confuse human concepts with the conceptuality of the physical entities, and human cognition with the cognitive behavior of the material entities (like the measuring apparatuses) that are sensitive to the meaning carried by the conceptual physical entities.\nSo, can we create a physical context able to put a chair in a superposition state, corresponding to two different locations,9 and at the same time also provide an interface able to conceptually interact with the chair in such a superposition state, i.e., to understand the meaning it carries and possibly subsequently collapse it onto states having well-defined spatial properties, as we can do with microscopic and mesoscopic physical entities? As we said, our tentative answer is that this should in principle be possible, and the fact that so far we have idealized entities like chairs as objects, instead of conceptual entities, is because their conceptual nature can only manifest when a context of the double-slit kind is created for them. But what could be considered the equivalent of a detecting screen for an entity like a chair? We can observe that since our standard terrestrial environment is able to maintain macroscopic bodies constantly in space, then this same environment can be expected to be able of also producing the collapse-the objectification-of a macro-entity like a chair in a superposition state. But then, how can we bring an entire chair in a more abstract state, of spatial superposition? Why would it be so difficult to do so, in comparison to, say, a hydrogen atom? The answer is simple: for larger and larger entities, it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain an effective shielding from the unceasing random thermal bombardment to which they are subjected to, on the surface of our planet, and there is not only the external bombardment: also the internal environment of the chair needs to be taken into account.\nTo explain what we mean, we can reason as follows. To put the whole chair in a superposition of two different spatial locations, we have to be able to describe the chair-entity as a coherent whole. In mathematical terms, this can be translated into the possibility of factorizing the wave function in a way that the center of mass contribution separates from the contribution coming from the movements of the different constituents, relative to that center and to each other's. Indeed, it is not the part of the wave function describing the relative motion of the internal components that we want to put in a superposition state (as this part of the wave function describes the structure of the chair, which we want to preserve), but that describing its center of mass, which describes the potential localization in space of the chair. In the case of a hydrogen atom, it is straightforward to separate the wave function relative to the center of mass from that associated with the relative motion, obtaining in this way a description of the evolution of the center of mass as a free evolving wave function (see any manual of quantum mechanics). But with a macroscopic body things get much more complicated, as to be able to describe the chair's center of mass by means of a free evolving wave-packet, the evolution of the body's center of mass needs to decouple from all internal degrees of freedom, and this can reasonably be done only if the body is cooled down to extremely low temperatures. How low? Well, low enough to avoid any exchange of energy between the center of mass degree of freedom and the degrees of freedom associated with all the internal relative movements (Sun et al. 2001).\nOne may wonder why these exchanges of energy would be so problematic. It is of course easy to understand that the external bombardment of heat packets of energy can cause what is usually denoted as loss of quantum coherence , which within the conceptuality interpretation translates into loss of meaning . This loss of meaning is caused by the fact that when a physical system is forced to communicate with a noisy environment, this will consequently blurr also the internal communications, with the result that the internal components will cease to behave as a coherent whole. But even if the external bombardment would not be thermal, but fully coherent, this would probably not solve the problem of the blurring of the internal communications of the chair-entity. Indeed, a chair is a very complex entity, made of innumerable parts, some of which are more cohesive than others. It is like an environment formed by different individuals, with different brains, so that even when they all receive the same input, like a spoken sentence (a concept in a given state), this will trigger a response that will differ depending on the individual involved. And of course, if numerous individuals are forced to chat together, all at the same time, without any coordination, producing each of them a different output, the overall result will be an unintelligible cacophony. This is what we can expect to happen in a photon-mediated communication happening at the level of the different pieces of matter that form the stuff the chair is made, like atoms, molecules, macromolecules, and other more or less separated coherent domains, because of the incessant processes of excitation and de-excitation.\nThe problem of this discordant and meaningless mixture of different communications can in principle be solved by silencing all the participants, taking away their energy by cooling down the chair-entity to extremely low temperatures, and of course do the same with its external environment. In these conditions of extremely cold external and internal environments, also a chair, at least in principle, could be brought into a non-spatial superposition state, by letting it interact with a macro equivalent of a double-slit context. Now, considering once more the parallel between a complex entity like a chair and the notion of story, we can observe that also in our human written stories there are parts of them that are more cohesive than others. Take the example of a novel: different chapters, which are like sub-stories, can be distinguished, and then there are the paragraphs, usually also containing more cohesive and self-contained \"units of discourse,\" associated with given ideas (so that each paragraph can be considered to be a conceptual entity in its own, in the specific state described by the combinations of words in the paragraph). But going even further, and considering the more specific human line of concretization, we can also observe in human documents the presence of the \"and\" and \"or\" connectives, with the former being usually much more abundant than the latter. As we observed already, the connective \"or\" usually increases the level of abstraction, whereas the connective \"and\" would typically go in the direction of making the combination more concrete. Clearly, Duck and mole conveys a much more specific meaning than Duck or mole , as the \"or\" is more easily associated with a new possible emergent meaning, not reducible to those conveyed by Duck and Mole taken separately, and which in the long run might acquire a brand new term for its designation.10\nThis breaking of symmetry between the \"and\" and \"or\" in human documental entities, and the fact that, generally speaking, the \"or\" connective produces stronger connections in meaning than the \"and\" connective (compare for instance Dead or alive with Dead and alive , Trick or treat with Trick and treat , etc.), is indicative of the fact that different domains of meaning exist within texts, where the concepts belonging to these domains are much more submerged in each others meaning, so that a clustering of documents in meaning structures of different sizes is inherent in the way a meaning type of interaction works at a fundamental level. And of course, the clustering process causes an objectification process, with the larger clusters usually attaining a stronger object status within the governing meaning type of interaction. And in a physical object like a chair, the same will happen, if we understand quantum coherence to be the equivalent of meaning in the case of micro-entities: there will be domains of coherence within a chair, separated from other domains of coherence , which in fact makes a chair, with good approximation, an entity formed by the conjunction of different parts with almost no meaning connection between them (no superposition), i.e., behaving almost as different objects. However, their conceptual nature can still be revealed, if an appropriate experimental context is put in place, like a context where the overall energy is lowered to a point where the de Broglie wave length associated to all these separated domains can overlap and start to intimately communicate (for a detailed discussion of the notion of de Broglie wave length, see Aerts 2014). Let us mention here en passant the difference between a dead piece of matter, like a chair, and a living piece of matter, like a platypus. One can say that the latter, different from the former, was able to construct, at room temperature, structures with nested domains of coherence (meaning) of all possible sizes, up to the size of the entire body of the living entity.\nEntanglement\nAfter what we discussed already in the previous sections, it becomes more easy to explain how entanglement can be accounted for in a satisfying way in the conceptuality interpretation. Entanglement is among the better studied and experimentally verified quantum phenomena, and one that appears to defy our common (spatial) sense, which is the reason why Einstein famously described entanglement as a \"spooky action at a distance.\" Indeed, the possibility of creating a condition of entanglement between two micro-entities appears not to depend on the spatial distance separating them or, to put it in more precise terms, appears not to depend on the spatial distance between the locations where the entangled entities can be detected with high probability. A characteristic of quantum entanglement (a direct consequence of the superposition principle) is that it is ubiquitous,11 in the sense that quantum entities naturally entangle whenever they are allowed to interact and will typically remain entangled for as long as nothing intervenes to disentangle them (to decohere them). This ubiquitousness of entanglement mirrors the ubiquitousness of the meaning-connections that are unavoidably present in any conceptual realm. As soon as two conceptual entities are allowed to meet in a given cognitive context, a meaning-connection will exist between them, whose strength will of course depend on how much meaning the two entities can share and exchange.\nTake the example of the two concepts Animal and Acts . These are two abstract concepts that are quite strongly meaning-connected in most contexts, as we all know from our experience of the world that animals are living beings and that living beings can do different types of actions, and that there are actions that certain animals will typically do that other animals will not do. This connection becomes perfectly evident when these two concepts are combined in a sentence like The animal acts . Almost all human minds will agree that such sentence possesses a full and perfectly understandable meaning. To better understand the nature of this meaning-connection between Animal and Acts , when combined as The animal acts , we can consider two couples of exemplars for both concepts, like the following ones (Aerts and Sozzo 2011): (Horse , Bear ) and (Tiger , Cat ) for Animal , and let us denote these two couples A and [Formula omitted], respectively, then (Growls , Whinnies ) and (Snorts , Meows ), for Acts , and let us denote them B and [Formula omitted], respectively. One can then invite a certain number of individuals to participate in the following coincidence experiment. Considering the combination The animal acts , they are asked to select pairs of exemplars for these two concepts, as representative examples of their combination. If they choose from the couples A and B , their selection will be considered to be the outcome of a joint measurement denoted AB , and similarly for the other combinations, thus defining in total four joint measurements: AB , [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted]. The statistics of all these outcomes can then be analyzed in the same way physicists analyze data of Bell-test experiments, for instance using that version of Bell's inequality known as the Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH) inequality (Clauser et al. 1969).12 And the result is that the inequality will be violated with magnitudes similar to those of typical laboratory physics' situations with entangled spins or entangled photons (Aerts and Sozzo 2011, 2014).\nSo, the conceptual combination The Animal Acts describes what in physics is considered to be an entangled state. Such combination contains both a specification of the state of Animal and of the state of Acts , but also a specification of the \"state of their connection.\" Indeed, if instead of The animal acts we would have used the more complex combination An animal that has been doped acts in a strange way , not only the specification of the states of Animal and Acts would be different, but also their meaning connection, in that context, would be different. This however is not how one would usually interpret an entangled state in quantum mechanics. Indeed, since genuine quantum states are only assumed to be described by pure states, and one cannot associate pure states to the different components of a composite entity when they are entangled, the usual conclusion is that when a composite entity is in an entangled state, its components cease to exist, in the same way as two water droplets also cease to exist when they are fused into a single larger droplet. This however is not fully consistent with the observation that entanglement preserves the structure of the composite entity. For instance, two entangled electrons, when disentangled, will still have the same mass and electric charge. In other words, quantum entities certainly do not completely disappear when entangled, as the conceptual combination The animal acts , interpreted as an entangled states, also indicates. So, do we have an incompatibility between the conceptuality interpretation and what the standard quantum formalism indicates? Surely not, though the conceptuality interpretation certainly pushes us towards a completion of the quantum formalism, to also allow the components of an entangled system to remain in well-defined states. This can be done by adopting the recently derived extended Bloch representation (EBR) of quantum mechanics (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2014a), where one can consistently represent the state of a bipartite composite entity as a triple of (real) vectors, with two of them specifying the individual states of the two components and the third one (of higher dimensionality) the state of their connection (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2016a, b). The reason why the extended Bloch representation can do so is that it is a completed version of the quantum formalism, where density operators also play a role as representatives of genuine states, so that one no longer needs to give up the general principle saying that a composite system exists, and therefore is in a well-defined state, if and only if its components also exist, and therefore are in well-defined states (see also Sect. 9, for the role played by the EBR in relation to the measurement problem).\nAs soon as we explain entanglement as a meaning-connection, the phenomen is demystified. First of all, because it becomes clear that there are no communications through space that should be associated with the quantum correlations, as a meaning-connection between two concepts is an abstract element of reality, not manifesting at the level of our spatial theater. And it is also clear that although it is correct to describe an entangled system, like two entangled electrons, as a whole, because of the presence of the meaning-connection playing the role of a connective element, not for this one should think that the conceptual entities would have lost their identity in the combination (in a nutshell, entanglement, as an emergent phenomenon, is not \"[Formula omitted],\" but \"[Formula omitted]\"). And once one considers the role played by this connecting element, it becomes evident that when individual properties are created (instead of just discovered) in a coincidence measurement, also correlations will be created (instead of just discovered), precisely because of the presence of a non-spatial (more abstract) connection. In other words, it is because correlations are created in a joint measurement (called correlations of the second kind Aerts 1991; Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2016b), instead of just discovered, that Bell's inequalities can be violated, and the only way to create correlations out of a composite entity is to have the components to be connected prior to the measurement.\nTo help better understand what we mean by this, consider two traditional dice. If we roll them at the same time, we will obtain 36 possible and equiprobable pairs of upper face-outcomes. This is a situation where no correlations can be detected in the statistics of outcomes. However, if we connect the dice through a rigid rod, then only certain couples of upper faces can be obtained, when they are jointly rolled, and not others (see Fig. 6). In this example, we can perfectly see the role played by the connecting element, here perfectly visible as a connection through space, and composite interconnected macro-systems of this kind can easily violate Bell's inequalities (Sassoli de Bianchi 2013). The connection through meaning plays exactly the same role of the rigid rod connecting the two dice through space. Of course, it will not work in such a stable way, when human minds select couples of exemplars representative of more abstract concepts, as fluctuations are also expected to be present. Remaining within the paradigm of the dice example, a more realistic description would be that of a rigid rod having a probability of also detaching and falling during the execution of the joint rolling process, so that correlations will not be always perfect, which is something that will typically lower the degree of violation of Bell's inequalities (Sassoli de Bianchi 2014).Fig. 6\nWhen two disconnected dice are jointly rolled, there are 36 equiprobable pairs of upper face-outcomes (no correlations). But if the two dice are connected through a rigid rod, when they are rolled only 4 pairs of upper face-outcomes can be obtained (correlations are created by the rolling experiment [see PDF for image]\nTo complete our discussion, let us also give the example of a conceptual situation that would be the equivalent of two micro-entities in a non-entangled (product) state, like two disconnected dice. Consider the conceptual combination The animal is a cat whose favorite act is to meow . Since such combination already actualizes a connection between Cat and Meow , the process of creating correlations during the joint measurement will be considerably reduced. In other words, we are here in a situation of correlations of the first kind (Aerts 1991; Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2016b), which will be typically discovered instead of created during the experiment. More examples could be provided of human conceptual situations mimicking what happens in entangled micro-system, when interpreted as conceptual meaning-connected systems. A quite suggestive cognitive psychology experiment was for instance recently performed, where participants were asked to select pairs of wind directions they considered to be good representatives of Two different wind directions , with the data showing a violation of the CHSH inequality of magnitude close to that of experiments with entangled spins (Aerts et al. 2017b). A symmetrized version of the experiment was also considered, which received a complete quantum modeling in Hilbert space, using a singlet state to describe the meaning-connection and product measurements to describe the interrogative context where couples of actual wind directions were selected (Aerts et al. 2017c).\nLet us use this last example of wind directions to make it even more explicit the parallel between the nature and behavior of conceptual and micro-physical entities. When we consider the conceptual combination Two different wind directions , none of the two winds concepts in it has a spatial direction. In the same way, considering two spin-[Formula omitted] quantum entity in a singlet (entangled) state, also in this situation the two spins have no spatial direction. These are only acquired when the two spin entities are forced by the measuring apparatus to acquire one, in the same way that participants to the cognitive experiment are forced to choose actual couples of wind directions. The way they do so depends on the accumulated human experience with winds blowing on the surface of our planet, and the meaning that was abstracted from these experiences. This will cause certain wind directions to be perceived as more different than others, thus favoring a process of creation of strong correlations during the selection of pairs of spatial directions that are judged be the best examples of Two different wind directions . This is exactly what also happens in coincidence experiments with two spin-[Formula omitted] entities in a singlet state, which is a state of zero spin where specific directions (eigenstates of the spin operators) have not yet been created. So, when the mind-like Stern-Gerlach apparatuses jointly select a spin direction, i.e., when they answer the question \"What is the best example of two different spin directions?\" they will produce an answer taking into account the meaning content carried by the composite conceptual spin entity, which can be described by the conceptual combination The total spin value is zero or, to express it in even more specific terms: Spin orientations are always opposite when they are created along a same direction .\nIndistinguishability\nIn the previous section, we explained that entanglement, according to the conceptuality interpretation, is the expression of a meaning-connection between conceptual entities. Sometimes, entanglement is described as quantum coherence , where the term \"coherence\" is to be understood as a given, fixed relation between states, which is precisely what an entangled state is: a fixed relation between product states expressed by means of their superposition. This relation, or connection, is a meaning-connection existing before the entangled entities are subjected to possible interrogative contexts. So, realism is clearly not at stake when dealing with entanglement, as reality, as we explained already, would not be fully contained in the spatiotemporal theater and entangled quantum entities would be entities in more abstract states, available to acquire spatial properties (like locations and directions) only when submitted to suitable contexts, like the measurement ones. In other words, we have to distinguish what connects entities, and the effects that these connections produce in terms of correlations that can be created in the laboratories, which are processes where more concrete exemplars/instantiations of abstract concepts can be jointly actualized.\nIn this section, we want to address another of the quantum conundrums, indistinguishability , and explain why it can be convincingly elucidated by the conceptuality interpretation; this because concepts have a built-in notion of indistinguishability, which is apparently what we also use by default when we deal with large collections of concepts (Aerts 2009; Aerts et al. 2015). But before that, let us briefly recall what the notion of indistinguishability is about. Two entities-let us call them [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted]-are said to be distinguishable if when we exchange their role this can have observable effects, at least in principle. Entities that are indistinguishable are said to be identical , and identical means that they possess exactly the same set of attributes, i.e., the same set of state-independent intrinsic properties, like for instance a same mass, charge and spin, as it is the case for all elementary micro-entities, for example electrons. Now, identical entities, although indistinguishable, are nevertheless individuals . This is precisely because they have attributes that can be measured and used to count how many of them are present in a composite system. For instance, the electric charge of a collection of electrons, if measured, will be Ne , with e the charge of a single electron and N an integer number indicating the number of identical electrons that are present in the collection. Hence, identical individuals are not necessarily a same individual, i.e., what renders two entities distinguishable appears not to be what also confers them their individuality.\nIndistinguishability has profound consequences on the statistical behavior of identical entities, when considered collectively. Consider first the case where [Formula omitted] would be in some way distinguishable from [Formula omitted], and assume for simplicity that they can only be in two different states, let us call them [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted]. Then, the two entities, when considered as a composite system formed by two non-interacting sub-entities, can be in 4 different states (see Fig. 7a): one where both entities are in state [Formula omitted], one where both entities are in state [Formula omitted], one where [Formula omitted] is in state [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted] is in state [Formula omitted], and finally one where [Formula omitted] is in state [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted] is in state [Formula omitted]. In the more general case where the number of distinguishable entities is n and the number of states they can be in is m , it is not difficult to see that the total number N of states of the composite system formed by n non-interacting sub-entities is: [Formula omitted], where the subscript \"MB\" stands for \"Maxwell-Boltzmann,\" as this way of counting is characteristic for the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics .\nBut consider now the situation where the two entities are indistinguishable. In this case, the situation where [Formula omitted] is in state [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted] is in state [Formula omitted], and the situation where [Formula omitted] is in state [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted] is in state [Formula omitted], cannot anymore be distinguished, hence they correspond to the same situation, which means that now we only have a total of 3 different states (see Fig. 7b). Again, a formula can be written for the general case: [Formula omitted], where the subscript \"BE\" stands for \"Bose-Einstein,\" as this way of counting is characteristic for the quantum Bose-Einstein statistics . For completeness, let us also describe a third situation, where not only the two entities are indistinguishable, but there is also the constraint that they cannot be jointly in the same state (Pauli's exclusion principle). Then only a single state remains for the composite system (see Fig. 7c), and for the general situation we have the formula: [Formula omitted], where the subscript \"FD\" stands for \"Fermi-Dirac,\" as this way of counting is characteristic for the quantum Fermi-Dirac statistics .Fig. 7\nThe total number of states for two entities that can be in two different states, [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted], when a they are distinguishable (spatial objects); b they are indistinguishable and can be in the same state (bosons); c they are indistinguishable but cannot be in the same state (fermions) [see PDF for image]\nIf the conceptuality interpretation correctly captures the nature of quantum entities, then quantum indistinguishability should appear also in the ambit of the human conceptual realm, at least to some extent, and produce non-classical statistics, not deducible from the MB way of counting states. Let us take the example of the abstract concept [Formula omitted]. We can consider a certain number of these [Formula omitted] concepts, say ten of them. A collection of this kind can be described by considering the two-concept combination: Ten animals . It is then clear that all the Animal concepts in the combination are completely identical and all exactly in the same state, i.e., all carrying exactly the same meaning, and that we are truly in the presence of a collection of entities, not of a single one. In other words, in the conceptual combination Ten animals the quantum indistinguishability becomes perfectly self-evident, so that the conceptuality interpretation offers a very simple and clear explanation of it. This would not possible for spatial objects, as is clear that two spatial objects are never indistinguishable, as they always occupy different locations in space, i.e., they are always in different spatial states. They can in principle all have the same intrinsic properties, but because of their spatiotemporal status they will always be distinguishable. So, the fact that Ten animals is a concept, and not an object, is crucial for it being able to carry the quantum feature of 'being many and at the same time being genuinely indistinguishable'.\nLet us consider then two possible exemplars of Animal : Cat and Dog . These are to be considered as two possible states of Animal , i.e., the states expressing the meaning that The animal is a cat and The animal is a dog , respectively. We are thus in the situation where [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted], so that [Formula omitted]. More specifically, the eleven states that the concept Ten animals can be in, when only the two exemplars Cat and Dog are considered, are: [Formula omitted]Ten cats , [Formula omitted]Nine cats and one dog , [Formula omitted]Eight cats and two dogs ,.., [Formula omitted]Two cats and eight dogs , [Formula omitted]One cat and nine dogs and [Formula omitted]Ten dogs . If we assume that the Cat and Dog states can be actualized with the same probability and that there are no ways to distinguish between the individual cats, nor between the individual dogs, then the probabilities for obtaining all these states are the same, and given by [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted]. On the other hand, in case there would be an underlying reality allowing to make further distinctions, then all these states would have a multiplicity. More precisely, the multiplicity of the state [Formula omitted] is [Formula omitted], which gives the MB probabilities: [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted]. More specifically: [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted].\nCan we find evidence for a deviation from the MB statistics to the BE one, due to the indistinguishability of the individual [Formula omitted] concepts in the combination Ten animals ? A possibility is to view the Web as a mind-like entity that can tell different stories, associated with all its searchable webpages. In this way, one can perform counts, using a search engine like Google, and use the obtained numbers as an estimate of the different probabilities (see Aerts et al. 2017a for more details about this way of interrogating the Web). When doing so, however, it is important to exclude the two extremal states [Formula omitted]Ten cats and [Formula omitted]Ten dogs , as these combinations will obtain counts that are two orders of magnitude greater than all the others, and this because the sentence \"ten cats\" (resp., \"ten dogs\") does not contain the \"dog\" (resp., \"cat\") word, and can thus easily combine with all possible other words. Furthermore, if we would use the more specific combination \"ten cats and zero dogs\" (resp., \"ten dogs and zero cats\"), we would obtain no counts, as we don't usually express things in this way in conventional human language. Thus, our Web interrogation will not provide correct data for the two states [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted], which therefore must be dropped from the statistics. This means that we only start counting the number of pages containing the combinations \"nine cats and one dog\" or \"one dog and nine cats.\" On August 20, 2017, Google gives: [Formula omitted]. Doing the same for the combinations \"eight cats two dogs\" or \"two dogs and eight cats,\" we obtain: [Formula omitted], and proceeding in the same way, we find: [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted]. With [Formula omitted], we can thus calculate the weights [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], and interpret them as the experimental probabilities for the states [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted]. These are: [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted]. In Fig. 8, we represent them together with the theoretical MB ([Formula omitted]) and BE ([Formula omitted]) probabilities (after having renormalized them, following the cut off of the extremal states). Clearly, the data obtained from the counts are much more typical of a BE statistics, with some added fluctuations, than a classical MB one.13Fig. 8\nA comparison of the Maxwell-Boltzmann ([Formula omitted]) and BE ([Formula omitted]) probabilities with those obtained by performing Google's counts (on August 18, 2017) on the Web (P ), in the situation where the conceptual entitiy Ten animals is considered in relation to the two exemplar-states Cat and Dog . Note that the extremal states Ten cats and Ten dogs were not considered in the calculation [see PDF for image]\nOf course, Google's counts are far from being a precise estimate of the actual number of existing webpages containing specific combination of words, which means that the above is to be only considered as an illustrative example, more than a demonstrative one. More examples of Web counts can be found in Aerts (2009) and Aerts et al. (2015). But more importantly, in Aerts et al. (2015) experiments on human subjects were also performed. More precisely, 88 participants were given a list of concepts, like Eleven animals , Nine humans , Eight expressions of emotion , etc., in association with two of their possible exemplars, like Cat and Dog for Animal , Man and Woman for Human , Laugh and Cry for Expression of emotion , etc. More precisely, different numerical combinations of exemplars were each time presented to them, for each one of the concepts, asking them to evaluate what are the most probable combinations, according to their preference. The obtained result show that the passage from the BE statistics (corresponding to a perception of strict indistinguishability of the concepts) to a classical MB one, depends on the concepts and exemplars considered in the experiment, in the sense that the easier it is to relate them to everyday life situations, and the more the obtained statistics will tend towards the MB one. On the other hand, the less the human imagination is influenced by real life situations (where MB statistics dominates) and can run free, the more the BE statistics will appear.\nWhat about the Fermi-Dirac (FD) statistics, can we also find traces of it in the human conceptual realm? We can observe that the interfaces with which the human concepts interact, i.e., the memory structures sensitive to their meanings, are certainly organized according to Pauli's exclusion principle . Take the simple example of a computer, which will not allow one to make a copy of a file and name it in the same way, if memorized in the same folder. So, we can have identical copies of a same concept, but these identical copies must be in different states within the memory (in different folders in the computer). But we also know that entities formed by ordinary (baryonic) matter, which according to the conceptuality interpretation are the cognitive/memory-like entities interfacing with the bosonic messengers, are made of elementary fermions. So, one would expect to be also able to identify the equivalent of these fermionic elementary entities within our human conceptual realm. Consider for instance the well-known distinction between count nouns and mass nouns (also called non-count nouns ). The count nouns are those that can be combined with a numeral (and therefore also accept the plural form). They give rise to combinations like Ten Animals , which as we discussed expresses a reality of ten identical entities all in the same state, typical of bosonic matter in so-called Bose-Einstein condensates. On the other hand, the mass nouns are those that have the property of not (meaningfully) combining with a numeral, without additional specifications. This means that we cannot have many identical non-count noun-concepts all in the same state. Take the example of the concept Courage , whose associated word has no plural form. The combination Two courage is clearly meaningless, which means that within the human language Courage is not a boson-like conceptual entity, as we cannot put a given number of them all in the same state. We are however allowed to write combinations like Courage, courage, courage , as we do when we repeat a word as a rhetorical device.14 But then there will be an order, which means that the Courage conceptual entities in the combination will be in different states, which is the reason why the more they are in the combination, the greater will be the space required to write them on a page in the form of words.\nTo push this parallel a bit further, consider also the combination Man of courage . Even if it contains the non-countable concept Courage , it can now be meaningfully combined with a numeral, for instance in: Ten men of courage . This means that by combining a non-countable concept with other concepts, an emergent boson-like behavior can be obtained. This is similar to the well-known fact that fermions, when they aggregate, can behave as bosons, like in the typical example of the [Formula omitted]-particles (Helium nuclei). Note that fermions can become bosons only when they are bond by some kind of interaction, which as we know is in turn mediated by bosons. This means that, strictly speaking, fermions alone cannot form a boson: we cannot construct bosons without bosons. In the above combination, Man is a boson-like (countable) concept, whereas Of and Courage are not. So, we could say here that the two fermion-like concepts Of and Courage interact through the boson-like concept Man , producing the combination Man of courage , whose behavior is boson-like. All this is of course for the time being purely heuristic, as we cannot expect to find within the human language conceptual realm the same level of organization of the microphysical realm (nor by the way we should expect that the former will necessarily evolve, in a far distant future, towards a same type of organization of the latter). In that respect, consider that the fermionic/bosonic duality of the micro-entities is intimately related to the rotational properties of the fractionary/integer spins they carry, according to the well-known spin-statistics theorem . However, quoting from Aerts (2009): \"[[Formula omitted]] although we can express the requirement of identity in general terms, the situation of human concepts and their interface of memory structures has not evolved sufficiently to contain a structure where rotational invariance may be expressed in general terms. This is also the reason that no equivalent of spin exists on this level.\" This does not mean that internal structures playing the same role in human concepts as spin and rotational invariance could not be identified, but this is a matter of future investigations.\nTo conclude this section about indistinguishability, consider also the concept Animals , i.e., Animal in the plural form, but not in a specific combination with a numeral. It clearly describes an ensemble of Animal conceptual entities all exactly in the same state, but whose number is perfectly undetermined. If we write Animals in an unpacked form, it can be understood as the infinite combination: One animal or two animals or three animals or four animals, etc. , which in the Hilbert space mathematical language one would write as a coherent superposition of the states One animal , Two animals , Three animals , etc., corresponding to the different possible numbers of Animal conceptual entities in their ground state. If you think of the harmonic oscillator, this would be like a state [Formula omitted] which is an infinite superposition of number-operator ([Formula omitted]) eigenstates: [Formula omitted], i.e., a state where, according to the number-phase uncertainty relation , the indetermination on the number of entities would be maximal, whereas the indetermination on their phases would be minimal, so much so that a description as a classical wave phenomenon would be possible. This is not the case for fermionic (non-countable) entities, for which, as is well-known, a classical undulatory approximation has no validity (L\u00e9vy-Leblond and Balibar 1997).\nMeasurement Problem\nIn the previous sections, we have considered different quantum phenomena and explained how they can be understood in the light of the conceptuality interpretation. By doing so, we have described the measuring apparatuses as memory structures sensitive to the meaning carried by the measured quantum conceptual entities, so that measurements would be like interrogative contexts during which a conceptual entity, usually prepared in an abstract (superposition) state, is forced to acquire a more specific state, corresponding to one of the possible answers that the experimental setting permit to be selected (similarly to when we have to fill a multiple choice form having predetermined answers to select). Of course, the fact that a measurement is like an interrogative process is a metaphor which can be used independently of the conceptuality interpretation. Indeed, a scientist, by means of a measurement, certainly interrogates the system subjected to it, and the outcome is the answer it receives. But this is a description only at the human cognitive level, which is necessarily always present in a scientific experiment, as is clear that science is a human activity. The conceptuality interpretation, however, adds a new cognitive layer: that of the meaning driven interaction between the measured entity and the measuring apparatus. So, the following question arises: Can human decision processes shed a light into what happens behind the scenes of a quantum measurement process and provide an additional argument in favor of the conceptuality interpretation?\nTo answer the above question, we have first to identify what are the important elements characterizing an interrogative process, when a cognitive entity is asked (or forced) to provide an answer when confronted with a given situation (that we can represent as a conceptual entity in a given state), selecting it from a number of predetermined possibilities. For this, we can ask what we intuitively feel when we are confronted with interrogative/decisional contexts of this kind. What we certainly can all recognize is that there will be a first phase during which we mentally immerse the situation in question into the context of the set of possible answers we have been given. If the situation is initially described by a state [Formula omitted] (which we write here as a projection operator), we can understand this first phase as a deterministic preparation process during which we bring the meaning of the situation as close as possible to the meaning of the different possible answers, which of course can also be described as final states of the conceptual entity which is the object of the interrogation. Assuming that there are N possible answers, let us call [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], these possible outcome states. So, there is a first immersive process during which the initial state D will transition to a new state [Formula omitted], expressing this more specific meaning-connection with the different possible outcomes/answers [Formula omitted]. Since only one of them can be selected (they are mutually excluding answers), this [Formula omitted] immersive process creates a temporary state of unstable equilibrium (whence the index \"e\") between the competing tensions resulting from the different meaning-connections between [Formula omitted] and the [Formula omitted]. Therefore, a second (usually indeterministic) phase will occur, which we can also subjectively perceive. It is the phase during which the mental tensional-equilibrium that was built is all of a sudden disturbed, in a way that cannot usually be predicted in advance, with the disturbance causing an irreversible process during which the conceptual state [Formula omitted] is drawn towards one of the possible answers [Formula omitted]. This is really like a (weighted) symmetry breaking process, reducing the previously competing tensions and so allowing the cognitive entity to actualize an answer.\nNote that the above two-phase cognitive process is a general description that can account also for situations where the answer is known in advance. In this case, the tensional equilibrium that is built will be a trivial one, in the sense that the meaning-connection with one of the outcomes will always prevail and produce the predetermined outcome without fail. But of course, in the general situations the interrogated person will not have yet formed a strong opinion regarding which answer is to be selected, so that all answers can truly play a competing role in the creation of the tensional equilibrium, and will therefore have a non-zero probability to be selected. It is important to say that what we are describing here is really a model of the mind's processes and not a model of the brain's processes, and that of course mind and brain processes need not to be the same.15 But since the conceptuality interpretation assumes that the measuring apparatuses behave like cognitive entities, and the measuring apparatuses are precisely what physicists use to actualize an outcome, the following question arises: Can we also describe a quantum measurement process as a two-phase cognitive-like process where the initial state of the measured entity is first brought into a state of tensional equilibrium, which is subsequently broken in a way that the process exactly obeys the predictions of the Born rule? The answer is affirmative and the description in question is contained in the so-called general tension-reduction (GTR) model (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2015a, b, 2016c), which in the special case where the state space is Hilbertian and the measurements are uniform reduces to the extended Bloch representation (EBR) that we mentioned already in Sect. 7 (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2014a, 2016b, 2017a).\nMore precisely, there is a way to reformulate the standard quantum formalism by using a generalization and extension of the historical three-dimensional Bloch sphere model, which contains an exact description of the above two-stage process. In other words, the quantum formalism naturally generalizes and extends into a representation which is compatible with a general description of a measurement as a cognitive-like interrogative process. When we say that it generalizes the Bloch sphere model, it is because it applies to quantum systems of any dimension N , in fact also of infinite dimension (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2017b), and when we say it extends the Bloch sphere model, it is because it allows for a description, in the same representation, of the (hidden) measurement-interactions that are responsible for the breaking of the tensional equilibrium. It is of course not the purpose of the present work to enter into all the mathematical details of the GTR-model or the EBR of quantum mechanics. But let us provide some additional information about how the latter works. By introducing a representation for the generators of SU (N ), the special unitary group of degree N , it becomes possible to associate real [Formula omitted]-dimensional unit vectors to the initial state D and the final states [Formula omitted], which we will denote [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], respectively. These are vectors living at the surface of a convex region of states that is inscribed in a [Formula omitted]-dimensional unit sphere [Formula omitted], which coincides with the latter only in the two-outcome ([Formula omitted]) case [thanks to the isomorphism between SU (2) and SO (3)]. Now, one can show that the N vectors [Formula omitted] are the vertex vectors of a [Formula omitted]-dimensional simplex [Formula omitted], inscribed both in the convex region of states and in [Formula omitted].\nThe first phase of the measurement then corresponds to an immersion of the state vector [Formula omitted] inside the sphere, along a path that is orthogonal to [Formula omitted], reaching in this way an equilibrium point [Formula omitted]. This is the mathematical counterpart of the stage we previously described as the cognitive activity bringing the conceptual entity in full contact with the \"potentiality region\" generated by the N mutually excluding answers. From a mathematical viewpoint, this causes the initial projection operator D , associated with [Formula omitted], to gradually decohere and transform into a fully reduced density operator [Formula omitted], associated with the (non-unit) on-simplex vector [Formula omitted], where the positive numbers [Formula omitted] are the Born probabilities. And this means that in the EBR also the density operators play a role as representative of genuine states (as we mentioned already in Sect. 7, in relation to the description of entangled sub-systems), describing the (non-unitary) evolution of the entity during the measurement itself. At this point, we can consider the \"tension lines\" going from the on-simplex state [Formula omitted] to the N outcome states [Formula omitted], partitioning [Formula omitted] into N convex subregions [Formula omitted], formalizing the unstable tensional equilibrium we previously described. We can imagine these N regions to be filled with an abstract elastic and disintegrable substance, so that when one of the regions-say region [Formula omitted]-starts disintegrating in a given internal point (this is the disturbance we previously described, due to the unavoidable fluctuations that are present in a measurement context), the disintegrative process will propagate within it, so that its [Formula omitted] anchor points will detach, with the consequence that the equilibrium state [Formula omitted] (we can imagine it as an abstract point particle attached to the elastic substance) will be brought towards the remaning vertex vector, here [Formula omitted], thus producing the measurement outcome (see Fig. 9, for the [Formula omitted] case). It then follows from the geometric properties of the structures involved that if we calculate the probability that the disintegration point happens in sub-region [Formula omitted], which is simply given by the ratio [Formula omitted] between the [Formula omitted]-dimensional volume (or Lebesgue measure) of sub-region [Formula omitted] and that of the full simplex [Formula omitted], that such ratio is exactly given by the probabilities [Formula omitted], i.e., by the quantum mechanical Born rule (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2014a, 2015a).Fig. 9\nThe unfolding of a measurement as a tension-reduction process, here with three possible (non-degenerate) outcomes: [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted]. The abstract point particle representative of the initial state is positioned in [Formula omitted], at the surface of the eight-dimensional sphere [Formula omitted] (which of course cannot be drawn). It then orthogonally \"falls\" onto the triangular elastic substance [Formula omitted] (an equilateral triangle) generated by the three outcomes, reaching the point [Formula omitted] and so defining three convex sub-regions: [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted]. The substance of [Formula omitted] then starts disintegrating at some unpredictable point, here inside [Formula omitted], so that [Formula omitted] fully disintegrates and detaches from its two anchor points, thus drawing the point particle to its final location, here [Formula omitted] [see PDF for image]\nLet us mention that the process we just described, and its mathematical modeling, also generalizes to the situation of degenerate measurements (see the above references), when the tension-reduction process does not result in a full resolution of the conflict between all the competing answers, so that the state is brought into a state of sub-equilibrium, between a reduced set of possibilities, described by a lower-dimensional sub-simplex of [Formula omitted]. To conclude this section about quantum measurements, let us also consider what could be a possible objection regarding our parallel between measurements in physics laboratories and cognitive processes where a mind-like entity selects one among a set of possible answers, according to the information stored in its memory. As we know, when we answer a question, the way we do so can vary every time, depending on the mental state we are at that moment. Also, the way of choosing an answer of a person will generally differ from the way of choosing of another person. On the other hand, a measuring apparatus always chooses in the same way, which is the way described by the Born rule. In other words, each person should be associated with quantum-like probabilities which will generally differ from those predicted by the Born rule. This is of course correct, and as we mentioned already, we should not think of human culture, and the cognitive processes associated with it, as a reality domain that would have reached the level of symmetry and of organization of the micro-physical domain.\nBut to be truthful, we don't really know if the measuring apparatuses always choose according to the Born rule. All we know is that the Born rule emerges from the statistics constructed from numerous outcomes. We thus cannot exclude that at each run j of a measurement the apparatus would select an outcome according to probabilities [Formula omitted] which would generally differ from the Born probabilities [Formula omitted]. This would mean that an apparatus not only actualizes an outcome from a set of potential ones, but also, at a deeper level, actualizes a way of choosing an outcome from a (typically infinite) set of potential ways of choosing. Of course, for this to be consistent with the results we usually observe in the labs, the average [Formula omitted] should tend to the Born probability [Formula omitted], as [Formula omitted], for all [Formula omitted]. This kind of average, called a universal average , can be studied in the GTR-model by considering abstract non-uniform substances disintegrating in all possible ways, thus giving rise to all possible sets of probabilities for the different outcomes. These different non-uniform substances would describe the different \"mental states\" of the apparatus at each run of the measurement, and the remarkable result is that one can show that a universal measurement (when the state space is Hilbertian), exactly corresponds to a uniform measurement described by the quantum mechanical Born rule (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2014a, 2015b, 2017a).16\nRelativity\nTo continue our exploration of the fertility of the conceptuality interpretation in providing new ways of explaining fundamental physical phenomena, we will now address relativity theory . Indeed, not only the quantum phenomena, but also the relativistic ones, do challenge our classical prejudices and, as we are now going to explain, also for them the conceptuality interpretation can help us shed some light on their possible origin. In doing so, we will limit ourselves to consider the phenomenon of time dilation . Also, we will limit our discussion to non-quantum relativistic entities (classical bodies) and will just provide at the end some clues about how to extend the reasoning to the quantum domain as well. But to begin with, let us observe that although the term \"relativity\" has been historically attached to Einstein, it refers in fact to a principle (the relativity principle ) that is much more ancient, as it was already described by Galileo Galilei in his famous example of the ship advancing at uniform speed, with people locked in the cabin beneath the deck not able to determine whether the ship was moving or just standing still (Galilei 1632). In fact, one also finds descriptions of this principle as early as the first century B.C., i.e., 1700 years before Galileo, in China, in The Apocryphal Treatise on the Shang Shu Section of the Historical Classic: Investigation of the Mysterious Brightnesses (Shang Shu Wei Kao Ling Yao ), where one can read: \"Although people dont know it, the earth is constantly moving, just as someone sitting in a large boat with the cabin window closed is unaware that the boat is moving.\"\nA possible synthetic statement of the relativistic principle is as follows: \"Equivalent viewpoints exist on the physical world.\" When the principle is formalized by using the notion of reference frame , it then becomes (L\u00e9vy-Leblond 1977): \"Equivalent frames of reference (space-time coordinate systems) exist for the physical laws, i.e., such that the physical laws have exactly the same form in all of them.\" This does not mean, however, that the different physical quantities will have the same values in the different equivalent reference frames: it means that they will obey exactly the same relations, so that phenomena will be perceived in the same way when experienced from these different but equivalent reference frames.17 The simplest examples of equivalent frames of reference are those that are translated or rotated with respect to each other, but Galileo, and before him the ancient Chinese sages, identified a more interesting non-trivial class of equivalent reference frames: those moving with respect to each other at constant speed, called inertial frames . The remarkable consequence of inertial frames that are equivalent frames is that an object moving at constant speed, from the viewpoint of the laws of physics, must be described in exactly the same way as an object at rest, i.e., as an entity on which the resultant force acting on it is zero. The first law of Newton , or principle of inertia then immediately follows: an object in motion at constant speed, like an object at rest, will forever remain in such state of motion, if not acted upon by some additional force.\nA much more remarkable consequence follows from the observation that there are wave phenomena (like the electromagnetic ones) that appear to propagate through the very \"substance of space,\" once called the ether. Indeed, if this would be the case, i.e., if space would be substantial and waves could propagate through its medium, then some physical effects (like interference effects) should manifest differently in different inertial frames, thus contradicting the very relativistic principle. But if the principle is true, as it appears to be, these differences should not be observed, and in fact have not so far been observed, for instance in the historical Michelson-Morley experiment and in those that followed, which showed instead that the speed of propagation in space of the electromagnetic fields is always the same, for all inertial frames and in all directions. This means that space, understood as an encompassing substantial theater for reality, becomes a problematic notion and that what we call space is essentially a relational construct, so that each physical entity, with its unique perspective, would actually inhabit 'a different space'. And this means that, as it will become clearer in the following, we do not see objects moving in space because they would actually move in an objective spatial theater, but because we confer them a movement in order to keep them inside our personal spatial representation. Now, as is well-known, when the relativistic principle is applied in conjunction with some very general and natural hypothesis about space and time, the Lorentz transformations are obtained as the only possible transformations connecting the different equivalent inertial frames (L\u00e9vy-Leblond 1976). Remarkably, these transformations do not affect only the spatial coordinates, but also the temporal ones, and the consequence is that objects, when they move with respect to a given reference frame, they are shorter in comparison to when they are at rest (length contraction ), and also, objects called clocks, when they move also run more slowly in comparison to clocks that are at rest (time dilation ). This means that what relativity is telling us is that the spatial constructs associated with the different physical entities cannot be just spatial, but have to be genuinely spatiotemporal.\nTo highlight this fact, consider the following thought experiment (see Aerts 1999 for a more extensive discussion). Imagine that you are at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), in Belgium (usually referred to as the Free University of Brussels , in English-speaking contexts), and that it is September 29, 2017, say 3 pm.18 We can call this your personal present moment [Formula omitted]. When you are at VUB, at time [Formula omitted], since you are having a direct experience with the university, you can affirm with certainty that VUB is real for you, i.e., that VUB is an existing element of your present personal material reality. But what about the reality of, say, the Universit\u00e1 della Svizzera italiana (USI), in Switzerland (usually referred to as the University of Lugano , in English-speaking contexts)? Since at time [Formula omitted] you are at the VUB, and you are not having an experience with the USI, can you nevertheless affirm that the USI is also an element of your present personal reality, at time [Formula omitted]? The answer is positive, and the reason for this is that, following EPR's reality criterion,19 we know that reality is a construction about the possible: if, in your past, you would have decided to travel to Lugano, Switzerland, then with certainty you would have had a direct experience with the USI at the present time [Formula omitted], and considering the certainty of such a prediction, you can say that also the USI is an element of your personal reality, at time [Formula omitted]. Consider now the VUB at subsequent time [Formula omitted], where [Formula omitted] is September 30, 2017, 3 pm, i.e., 1 day in your future with respect to your present time [Formula omitted]. Is the VUB at time [Formula omitted] also an element of your reality? If we rely only on our parochial conception of space and time, we would respond negatively, but this would be a wrong answer considering what we know about the relativistic effects, and more specifically the effect of time dilation: the slowdown of the ticking rate of moving clocks, when compared to those that remain at rest.\nIndeed, if in your past, say on September 28, 2017, 3 pm, you would have used a space ship to travel at speed [Formula omitted] (where c is the speed of light) to any destination, then back again along the same route, because of the relativistic time dilation effect you could have been back at VUB exactly when your smartphone would indicate September 29, 2017, 3 pm, whereas the smartphones of all other people at VUB would indicate September 30, 2017, 3 pm. So, if you take seriously EPR's reality criterion, you must conclude that the VUB, 1 day in its future, is also an element of your present personal reality. Now, since the present discussion is aimed at an interdisciplinary audience, we think it can be useful to also briefly explain how time dilation is calculated in relativity theory. So, there are two versions here of the same individual, one remaining at rest at VUB,20 who we will call entity A , and the other performing the round-trip journey, who we will call entity B (see Fig. 10). If we denote [Formula omitted] the time-period of the clock carried by B during her/his trip, as measured by A , using an identical clock remaining at VUB, the time period of which is [Formula omitted],21 s/he will observe a time dilation effect, i.e., that [Formula omitted] is greater than [Formula omitted]. More specifically, if v is the speed of B (when moving away or approaching A ), then we have [Formula omitted], where [Formula omitted] is the so-called Lorentz gamma factor , which is equal to 2 for the above value of the speed v . Hence, we have that [Formula omitted], i.e., that the clock traveling with B appears to A to run twice as slow than the clock that remained at VUB.Fig. 10\nThe two worldlines of the entities A and B , in the spacetime construction associated with the former. Entity A is spatially at rest, thus only moves along her time axis, whereas entity B goes on a round-trip journey, allowing her to meet again with entity A , in her-1 day after-future [see PDF for image]\nLet us now assume that A measures [Formula omitted] cycles of her/his clock for the entire duration of the trip of B .22 Since [Formula omitted], the number of cycles [Formula omitted] of the clock of B will be obtained by solving the equation: [Formula omitted], which gives [Formula omitted], and for our value of the speed v we have: [Formula omitted]. In other words, the traveling entity B uses half the time-cycles of the non-traveling entity A . Now, to determine the time [Formula omitted] (where [Formula omitted] corresponds to September 29, 2017, 3 pm) at which B would have needed to start her/his space travel at speed [Formula omitted], in order to be back at the same place, at VUB, at time [Formula omitted] (corresponding to September 30, 2017, 3 pm), with her/his clock indicating September 29, 2017, 3 pm, we can reason as follows. By definition, we have [Formula omitted], and let us also denote [Formula omitted] the number of cycles corresponding to a 1 day (24 h) period: [Formula omitted]. We want that [Formula omitted], i.e., we want the clock of B to use 24 h less than the clock of A . Since [Formula omitted], we obtain [Formula omitted], so that for [Formula omitted] we have [Formula omitted]. In other words, B has to start her/his trip 2 days before September 30, 2017, 3 pm, that is, on September 28, 2017, 3 pm (see Fig. 10).\nComing back to our discussion, being our personal present reality defined in a counterfactual way, via the EPR criterion, we have to conclude, as a consequence of the relativistic generalized parallax effects , that our personal present also contains a part of our personal future. However, this not in the sense that all of our future would be given, as if the universe would be an unchanging block. Indeed, if it is true that in a given reference frame we can always attach time and space coordinates to the different events, this doesnt mean that the processes of change that have created them are also happening in space and time. Indeed, these processes typically originate from a non-spatiotemporal realm, which remains hidden from our limited spatiotemporal perspective. So, if Galilean relativity has told us that physical entities are not inhabiting a substantive objective space, as each entity constructs a personal three-dimensional relational space, Einsteinian relativity has pushed such view a step further, telling us that entities are not only not inhabiting a substantive space, but also that they do not construct their time axis in the same way, i.e., that each entity constructs a personal four-dimensional spacetime. We thus see that, similarly to quantum mechanics, relativity also indicates the existence of an underlying non-spatial and non-temporal realm. And as we are now going to explain, the hypothesis that physical entities would have primarily a conceptual nature is not only able to offer an explanation for the strangeness of the quantum effects, but also for the relativistic ones, which are erroneously considered to be less strange than the former (if we try to understand them by maintaining a purely spatiotemporal perspective).\nTime Dilation\nLet us consider again the previous example, assuming this time that A and B are not two different versions of the same person, who made a different choice in the past, but two different physical entities, so that we are now in the specific situation of Langevin's twin-paradox. Note that the reason why it was referred to as a paradox is the fact that one could argue that by considering the viewpoint of the reference frame associated with the space ship, it is the entity remaining on Earth that appears to have performed the return trip. This apparent symmetry between the two descriptions is however broken as soon as one observes that the two reference frames are non-equivalent, as is clear that the frame associated with entity B , using the space ship, is a non-inertial one. In other words, the symmetry is broken by observing that B experiences accelerations that are not experienced by A (neglecting those associated with the rotation of the planet). One should not conclude, however, that the observed time-dilation effect (or length contraction effect, from the viewpoint of the traveling entity) would be caused by these accelerations: it is in fact the geometric structure of the worldlines associated with the two entities that is responsible for the time dilation, which is truly defined by the Lorentz-invariant length corresponding to the so-called proper time interval associated with them (Aerts 2017).\nThe two entities A and B are here considered to be classical macroscopic bodies, i.e., ordinary objects. However, as we discussed in Sect. 6, in the conceptuality interpretation objects are idealizations of story-like conceptual entities that can be in different meaning-states. So, we want now to consider the two entities A and B not as objects moving in space but, primarily (and more fundamentally), as conceptual entities that can have meaning driven interactions. In relativity, one usually associate observers with entities in different states of motion, where the notion of observer is typically understood as a shortcut for a reference frame plus an entity that, if it would be present in some specific location, would be able to perceive (detect, measure) phenomena relative to the viewpoint of that reference frame and specific location.23 We will also associate observers with the two entities A and B , but we will consider them as mind-like entitities sensitive to the meaning carried by A and B . Let us simply call them cognitive observers , and denote them [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted]. These two observers are however not associated with spatiotemporal frames of reference. The only aspect distinguishing [Formula omitted] from [Formula omitted] is that the former is focused on the evolution of A , whereas the latter is focused on the evolution of B .\nTo fix ideas, we can simply consider that the process of change of state of entity A corresponds to the cognitive activity of entity [Formula omitted], reflecting on a given problem, so that the initial state of A would correspond to the Hypothesis initiating such reflection, and the final state of A to the Conclusion reached by [Formula omitted], after having followed a certain number of intermediary conceptual steps . And same for the cognitive observer [Formula omitted], following the evolution of the conceptual entity B .24 Here we will assume that [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted] are just witnessing the unfolding of the meanings carried by A and B , as they evolve, i.e., that they are not themselves producing the observed changes of their states. Also, to place ourselves in the \"twin-paradox\" situation, we consider that [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted] are both reflecting on the same problem, starting with the same Hypothesis and subsequently jointly reaching the same Conclusion . In other words, in the conceptual abstract realm that they both inhabit, they have a first meeting at the \"place\" of their commonly shared Hypothesis , then a second encounter when they reach the same Conclusion . The difference between [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted], however, is that the cognitive path they follow to reach that same Conclusion , starting from the same Hypothesis , is not the same, in the sense that [Formula omitted], focused on the evolution of A , is assumed to use [Formula omitted] conceptual steps to do so, whereas [Formula omitted], focused on the evolution of B , is assumed to use a lesser number of steps [Formula omitted]. Let us denote [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], the different states through which A passes to go from the Hypothesis = [Formula omitted], to the Conclusion = [Formula omitted], and let us denote [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], the states B transition through to also go from the Hypothesis = [Formula omitted], to the Conclusion = [Formula omitted].\nImagine then that the cognitive observer [Formula omitted], to keep track in an orderly manner of the conceptual path followed by entity A , decides to introduce an axis to parameterize each one of A 's conceptual steps. For this, it will ascribe a unit length [Formula omitted] to such axis, corresponding to a single conceptual step, and it will also assume that the speed at which each step is accomplished is the same for all steps and is equal to a given constant c , so that the duration of a single step is: [Formula omitted]. When going from the Hypothesis to the Conclusion , the reasoning of [Formula omitted] will thus correspond to a movement of entity A , along such order parameter axis , going from an initial point [Formula omitted] to a final point [Formula omitted], where we have defined the times [Formula omitted], [Formula omitted], where [Formula omitted] is the initial time and [Formula omitted] the final time. Consider now the evolution of entity B , which we assumed can reach the same Conclusion following a shorter conceptual path, only made of [Formula omitted] steps, and for simplicity we will consider here that [Formula omitted]. The cognitive observer [Formula omitted] can also decide to focus on the evolution of B , i.e., might also be willing to keep track of the cognitive path followed by entity B , in addition to that of A . Now, if A and B are entities of the same nature, it can be assumed that when they produce a cognitive step, they do so at the same speed c . But then, since the path followed by B in the abstract conceptual realm is such that it can reach the same Conclusion in half the steps used by A , the cognitive observer [Formula omitted] cannot represent such path on the same axis used to parametrize the path of A , as units on the latter were precisely chosen in a way that one needs twice the number of steps to reach the Conclusion .\nTo consistently parametrize also the evolution of B , [Formula omitted] is thus forced to introduce an additional axis, and use the additional dimension generated by such axis to describe B as moving on a round-trip path, now contained in a higher dimensional space generated by both the first parametric axis-let us call it the time axis of A -and this second parametric axis-let us call it the space axis of A . So, the evolution of entity B is described as a movement on a path leading away from such time axis and then coming back to it, to reach the Conclusion meeting point, and this by doing exactly [Formula omitted] cognitive steps (see Fig. 11). However, if we consider the construction of this parametric space from a purely Euclidean perspective, we immediately see that things do not work. Indeed, if we calculate the length of the B -path using the Pythagorean theorem , we will necessarily find a path that is longer than that walked by A .Fig. 11\nThe coordination of the conceptual paths followed by the two entities A and B , in the spacetime constructed by the cognitive observer [Formula omitted] (here in the situation [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted]). When measured along the time axis of A (multiplied by the constant speed c ) the length [Formula omitted] of the conceptual steps of B appear to be longer than the length [Formula omitted] of those of A . However, when measured along the direction of its own movement in the A -spacetime, using the Minkowski instead of the Euclidean metric, one finds that the conceptual steps of the two entities are exactly of the same length, in accordance with the fact that they both move at the same (absolute) constant speed c in the underlying conceptual realm [see PDF for image]\nThis would not be correct, as is clear that B follows a shorter conceptual path, only using half of the conceptual steps used by A . Therefore, when measuring the length of B 's conceptual path, it should be shorter and not longer than that of A . For [Formula omitted] to fix this problem, the only way to go is to consider a pseudo-Euclidean space, instead of an Euclidean one, and more precisely that specific pseudo-Euclidean space known as the Minkowski space (or spacetime), where distances are not calculated using the Pythagorean theorem , but a pseudo-Pythagorean theorem attaching a negative sign to the squares of the components associated with the space axis, and a positive sign to the square of the components associated with the time axis. In this way, the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, whose catheti are associated with the time and space axes, respectively, will generally be less than the length of the time-cathetus. It becomes then possible for the length [Formula omitted] of a single conceptual step of B (see Fig. 11) to be exactly equal to the length [Formula omitted] of a single conceptual step of A , i.e., to have the equality [Formula omitted], which is what [Formula omitted] wants to have, as the two entities A and B are assumed to change state at the same absolute speed c (the speed of light in vacuum) in their common conceptual realm, so that the duration/length of their conceptual steps must be an invariant , i.e., the same for all entities.\nMore precisely, if L is the component of the length [Formula omitted] along the space axis of A , then according to the pseudo-Euclidean (Minkowski) metric we have: [Formula omitted], so that the requirement that [Formula omitted], or equivalently [Formula omitted], considering that [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted], gives: [Formula omitted], that is, [Formula omitted]. In other words, by adopting a pseudo-Euclidean (Minkowski) metric, the cognitive observer [Formula omitted] is able to construct a spacetime theater in which it can keep track, in a consistent way, not only of the cognitive process associated with A , but also of that associated with B ,25 and to do so all it has to do is to attach an appropriate spatial velocity v to characterize its state changes. In other words, the reason for the time-dilation generalized parallax effects becomes clear when the existence of an underlying conceptual realm is taken into consideration: since [Formula omitted] has to also parametrize the cognitive path of B , and cannot do it using the same time-axis, it has to consider a movement within a higher dimensional space, characterized by an angle [Formula omitted] with respect to the direction of the movement of A . This will inevitably introduce temporal effects of perspective : [Formula omitted] will observe B as if it was producing conceptual steps (or cycles) having an increased duration [Formula omitted]. This means that [Formula omitted], focusing its attention on A , when it compares its cognitive activity with that of an observer [Formula omitted], focusing its attention on B , will have the impression that [Formula omitted] reasons more slowly than itself, but since it also reasons more efficaciously, as it uses a lesser number of conceptual steps, they are nevertheless able to meet at the common Conclusion state. This is just how things appear to be at the level of the spacetime parametrical construction operated by [Formula omitted]. At the more objective level of the non-spatiotemporal conceptual realm, A and B move at exactly the same speed c , which is the intrinsic speed at which they both perform their conceptual steps.\nOur description of time-dilation effects would of course require more explanations, and we refer the reader to Aerts (2017), where more details can be found. Our main point here was to highlight that relativity theory, similarly to quantum mechanics, indicates the existence of a non-spatiotemporal conceptual realm. As we mentioned already, our discussion indicates that its non-temporality is however not to be understood in the sense of an absence of processes of change. On the contrary, every conceptual (physical) entities would incessantly change state, i.e., produce new conceptual steps, by all \"surfing\" over the conceptual realm at the light speed c . Therefore, at a more fundamental level, movement would be incessant, and in a sense absolute. This is possible because it is not a movement in space and time, as space and time would only emerge when a cognitive observer decides to coordinate the evolution of a given conceptual entity with the evolution of other conceptual entities, introducing for this a specific Cartesian coordinate system. In such system, the time axis orders the conceptual changes of the entity the cognitive observer decides to primarily bring its focus to, whereas the spatial axes order the evolution of the other conceptual entities, relative to such proper time-axis, by representing them as movements in space. Such spatiotemporal construction, to be consistent, requires the metric to be Minkowskian, which of course remains counterintuitive to us humans, as we evolved on this planet by mostly interacting with entities moving extremely slowly in space with respect to one another, i.e., that are almost at rest with respect to one another, so that the relativistic parallax effects, being negligible, were not integrated in our mental representation of the world.\nOf course, this spatiotemporal representation only works for conceptual entities having reached the status of objects, the so-called classical macroscopic bodies. When micro-physical entities are considered, the time-space duality must be replaced by a more general duality between time and the set of outcome-states associated with the different possible measurements. This is for instance the situation where the cognitive observer [Formula omitted] would not merely witness the surfing of entity A over the more fundamental conceptual realm, but in fact would also affect its surfing through its observation, thus also introducing in its evolution the additional ingredient of indeterminism. Note that the possibility for [Formula omitted] to also act as a quantum measurement context for entity A is not incompatible with the special situation of a deterministic evolution. Indeed, any deterministic change of state can in principle be conceived as being the result of a measurement having just a single possible outcome.26 This means that deterministic evolutions can in principle be described as recursive applications of multiple one-outcome measurement processes. Some of these processes will be governed by classical contexts, and the corresponding deterministic evolution can be described as an 'evolution in space', others will be governed by genuine quantum contexts, and the corresponding deterministic evolution cannot be described as happening in space, but in a more abstract (conceptual) non-spatial (and non-temporal) realm.\nWe already mentioned in Sects. 7 and 9 the extended Bloch representation (EBR) of quantum mechanics (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2014a, 2016b, 2017a), which can be used to construct a quantum theater in which all the measurement processes associated with a quantum entity, and its states, can be jointly represented. For measurement contexts admitting sets of up to N possible outcome-states, the number of required dimensions for the associated Blochean quantum theater is equal to [Formula omitted], which is the number of generators of the SU (N ) group of transformations. Roughly speaking, these transformations can be interpreted as \"generalized rotations,\" and this means that to enter such Blochean theater one has in a sense to \"rotate away\" the intrinsic complexity of a quantum entity, by means of these generators. A human conceptual analogy here would be that of considering that to enter a given space of discourse, like that of a political agenda, certain concepts first need to receive a \"twist.\" Our spatiotemporal theater, considered as a specific space of discourse, would require in the same way specific \"twists\" to be applied, for the different quantum conceptual entities to enter and be representable in it.",
        "methodology": "We conclude our discussion about relativistic effects with a brief remark about gravitation. As is well known, we are still lacking a satisfactory quantum gravity theory, and this because the fundamental forces in the Standard Model of particle physics are modeled as (quantized) fields in a fixed spatiotemporal background, whereas the gravitational forces precisely affect that background, making it a dynamical one. Different from the Standard Model and similar approaches, attaching a fundamental role to the spatiotemporal canvas, the conceptuality interpretation posits that reality is not contained in spacetime, the latter being just a relational construction emerging each time a very specific interface is considered: that between the macroscopic pieces of matter and the force fields acting on them, i.e., between the fermionic constructions and their bosonic way of exchanging meaning. It is in this interface that the illusion was formed of a spatiotemporal theater in which our physical reality would be fully contained; an illusion which was then consolidated through the very scientific experimental method, somehow forcing us to only approach our physical reality through such interface, as is clear that physicists, in their laboratories, always collect data from experiments involving apparatuses formed by macro-pieces of matter. If space and time (we should better say spaces and times) are by-products of this very specific interface, we can more easily understand the reason of the difficulties that were encountered in the attempts to construct a consistent quantum gravity theory. The conceptuality interpretation, by pointing to the existence of a more fundamental and abstract realm, in which the physical conceptual entities evolve, the fundamental forces, gravity included, are then allowed to be understood as expressions of the different ways conceptual entities can exchange meaning, and because of that be brought together, or apart.",

        "conclusion": "Conclusion\nIt is time to move towards the conclusion of our tour d'horizon of the conceptuality interpretation and its explicative power. In this last section, we will just evocate some possible directions for subsequent investigations, and in this regard we also refer the interested readers to Aerts (2009, 2010a, b, 2013, 2014).\nConcerning the so far failed tentative to unify gravitational and quantum elements of reality within a unique consistent theoretical construction, which we mentioned in the previous section, let us observe that the conceptuality interpretation brings another interesting line of reflection: it is also a possibility that a single 'quantum plus gravitational' description might not be feasible, in the sense that 'quantum' and 'gravity' could very well be incompatible descriptions, in the same way that position and momentum measurements are incompatible experimental contexts. Indeed, a conceptual reality is also a contextual reality, i.e., a reality where certain meanings would be actualized and actualizable only in certain contexts, and not in others. In that respect, classical physics can also be understood as a description emerging from a very specific context, produced by us humans mostly manifesting and interacting with physical entities through our macroscopic dense bodies. Standard quantum mechanics, and more precisely its formalization through the Hilbertian formalism, can be considered as another context associated with different operationally posed questions, whose answers cannot be all organized in the 'space of relations' that resulted from the previous classical construction, forming a sort of closed representational environment (somehow in the spirit of Heisenbergs notion of closed theories Bokulich 2008). But the quantum representation, which also has its structural shortcomings, might as well form another closed environment, considering for instance its inability to describe entities that can remain separated in experimental terms (Aerts 1984, 2014; Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2017d). In other words, it is also possible that a single encompassing representation could not be obtained, precisely because it would correspond to the unrealistic desiderata of simultaneously actualizing properties/meanings that are in ultimate analysis associated with incompatible contexts.27\nIn addition to that, the conceptuality interpretation, with its hypothesis that physical entities are fundamentally conceptual, also fosters a pancognitivist view (as was mentioned in the Introduction), where every element of reality would in fact participate in cognition, with human cognition being just a special case of it, appearing at a very particular organizational level. This has clearly deep consequences on our view about evolution in general, as the advent of the biological species on our planet, including the human one, would only be part of a much wider and fundamental process of change resulting from the interaction of conceptual entities with the countless cognitive structures that are sensitive to their meaning, and this since the dawn of the formation of our universe and at different levels of the same. If this is correct, the default picture we should adopt in the description of our evolving physical reality is that of a huge and multilayered cultural evolution (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2018). So, in the same way we humans use concepts and their combinations to communicate and evolve our cultures, the same might have occurred, and would still be occurring, in the micro-realm, and this automatically provides a compelling explanation for so-called dark matter , which can then be understood as that part of matter which, as an interface, has not co-evolved together with the bosonic \"messenger\" entities. Think of the abundance in our human environment of those structures that cannot exchange human meaning, i.e., the ordinary pieces of matter as opposed to the cultural artifacts, the former being much more abundant than the latter. The same could be for dark matter, as opposed to ordinary matter, which not only does not interact with the bosonic micro-carriers of meaning, but also appears to be indeed much more abundant. On the other hand, gravity, by working at a very different scale than all the other forces, would possibly describe a more ancient way of exchanging meaning and creating concentrations of it; a way which has remained in common with both ordinary and dark matter.\nThis special role played by gravitation can also be seen in the diversity of the mass values of the different micro-physical entities, which are not just multiples of some fundamental unit, as it is the case for instance for the electric charge. This seems to suggest that mass is not so much connected to the notion of identity of a given conceptual entity, but instead to the different possible ways a given identity is able to manifest. Think of the puzzling existence of the three different generations of elementary micro-entities . Entities that are members of these different generations interact exactly in the same way, but differ in their masses. To give an example, there are three different electronic entities: the ordinary electron of the first generation, having a mass of 0.511 MeV/[Formula omitted], the muonic electron of the second generation, having a larger mass of 106 MeV/[Formula omitted], and finally the tauonic electron of the third generation, with an even larger mass of 1777 MeV/[Formula omitted] (almost twice the mass of a proton). The conceptuality interpretation offers the following possible element of explanation for these different generations of micro-entities: they would simply correspond to different energetic realizations of a same conceptual entity, in the same way as in our human culture a concept can manifest as, say, a spoken sound-energetic form, an electromagnetic and/or electronic form, in a carved into stone form, etc., and all these different forms, although they have different mass-energies, they nevertheless always convey the same meaning, i.e., they interact in a meaning-driven environment in exactly (or almost exactly) the same way.\nLet us for a moment also mention the issue of the observed intrinsic expansion of the universe, according to current Big Bang theories. The recurring question is: \"In what the universe is expanding into?\" And the recurring answer is: \"This is a nonsensical question, as the universe contains everything and there is nothing into which it could be expanding, so, it is just expanding!\" Of course, this kind of answer is perceived as highly unsatisfactory to the layman, and rightly so, as we think it should be unsatisfactory to the professional physicist as well. As we discussed at length in this article (Aerts 1999): \"Reality is not contained within space. Space is a momentaneous crystallization of a theatre for reality where the motions and interactions of the macroscopic material and energetic entities take place. But other entities-like quantum entities for example-'take place' outside space, or-and this would be another way of saying the same thing-within a space that is not the three-dimensional Euclidean space.\" The conceptuality interpretation allows one to push even further this statement, by observing that reality's non-spatiality results from it being of a fundamental conceptual nature, implying the existence of a multilayered structure resulting from the interplay between states having different degrees of abstractness and concreteness.\nIn other words, the expansion of our universe would simply be the result of a cosmic-cultural evolution constantly creating new stories (through a mechanism of conceptual combination), which emerge from a substrate of more abstract entities (i.e., conceptual entities in more abstract states) that can combine together to form more complex states. To draw a parallel with the Web, think of the constant creation of new webpages, arising from the activity of all cognitive entities participating in the associated human meaning-driven interactions. In that respect, it is interesting to observe that the expansion of the Web, since the first web-site was published back in 1991, has been an accelerated one, so one can also think of the observed increasing rate of expansion of our universe to be the result, mutatis mutandis , of a cultural accelerated growth mechanism. Let us also mention that a conceptual reality also points to the possibility of multiverses (not in the sense of the many-worlds interpretations), as is clear that stories sharing common meanings can form aggregates, and that some of them might have form a very long time ago, around an initial \"seed concept.\" Just to offer another analogy, think of so-called \"shared cinematic universes\" of our recent years movie culture: each shared cinematic universe contains a growing number of films (stories) that are all meaning connected, focusing on different characters or group of characters, but all part of a same coherent and non-contradictory continuity. On the other hand, stories about characters in a given cinematic universe will never appear in another one, and if \"crossovers\" nevertheless happen (think of DC Comics' Superman possibly meeting Marvel Studios' Spider-Man), the associated stories will be usually considered to be non-canon, i.e., more abstract states of the characters involved, for instance described as alternate realities, \"what if\" scenarios, jokes and gags, dreams, etc.\nWhen it comes to our spatiotemporal universe and its vastness, the question of the possible presence of intelligent extraterrestrial life also arises in a natural way, also because the majority of scientists is convinced that intelligent extraterrestrials populate space, resulting in various scientific programs that over time have been funded for the search for intelligent life. As Carl Sagan used to say, in a famous science-fiction novel (Sagan 1985): \"The universe is a pretty big place. If it's just us, seems like an awful waste of space.\" Space, however, would only be the tip of the iceberg of a realty whose spatiotemporal manifestation would only correspond to a thin layer of it. We can of course explore \"in width\" such layer, which certainly is a vast territory if considered from our human limited perspective, but following the view that we have expressed in the present article, there is another territory, incredibly wider, which is about exploring reality \"in depth,\" in the direction of its more abstract states. This is what physicists have begun to do when designing refined experiments about the many different quantum and relativistic effects. These experiments, and the associated efforts to describe their outcomes by means of a suitable formal language,28 can be seen to be our first primitive steps in learning a non-human and more universal proto-language, so perhaps it will be by exploring reality along this \"in depth\" direction that contacts with extra-terrestrial (extra-dimensional) intelligence will firstly occur, if they have not already occurred (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2018).\nLet us also mention John Wheeler's famous \"it from bit\" epitome, which he used to indicate that (Wheeler 1989): \"all things physical are information-theoretic in origin,\" in a participatory universe. The conceptuality interpretation completes Wheeler's account in two different ways. First of all, by extending the notion of participant, which is not limited to humans creating meaning by operating measurement devices, as the latter (and more generally, all pieces of matter) would themselves be meaning-sensitive entities able to exchange information, independently of the presence of the human consciousnesses. Secondly, by observing that \"bit,\" understood as a unit of measure in meaning exchanges, is not what combines to construct the physical entities of our spatiotemporal environment, or to more generally produce the different physical phenomena.29 What combines is not the bits of information, but the conceptual entities carrying such information, which participate in a grand conversation where the different cognitive participators, at different organizational levels, constantly exchange streams of meaningful information. So, following Wheeler's desiderata to synthesize the central point of quantum theory (and, we also add, of relativity theory) in a simple and concise statement that anyone could understand, we believe that such statement might be: the stuff the world is made of is conceptual .\nTo conclude, it is important to note that the conceptuality interpretation also contains an explanation that would make our physical reality intelligible again to human pre-scientific intuition and thinking. This certainly distinguishes it from all the other interpretations, and also confers to it a highly speculative character, at least at the present state of our investigation. In that respect, it is important to mention again how crucial it is not to confuse the human conceptual realm with the conceptuality that would be inherent in our physical world. In pre-scientific times, in order to make sense of the physical entities and associated phenomena, we humans tried to psychologize them, conferring them human-like mental attributes, motivations and behaviors. According to the conceptuality interpretation, by doing so we committed a serious mistake, but at the same time we also accessed a deep insight about the physical world. The deep insight is the recognition that the latter would share with our human cultural world a same conceptual/cognitive nature; the serious mistake is about believing that physical entities and human cognitive/conceptual entities would exchange the same kind of meaning. This is the same kind of mistake we committed when we believed that planet Earth was fixed at the center of the universe, which was then reduced to a mere celestial sphere with the stars attached to it. When we escaped this \"Ptolemaic cave,\" following the Copernican revolution, we accessed an incredibly wider and richer universe. Similarly, by escaping the \"cave of our human-centered worldview,\" following the \"conceptuality revolution\" (if it will turn out to be such), we might also access an incredibly deeper and richer reality, requiring us to learn not only new languages, but also the non-human semantics attached to them.",

The first scientific description of the platypus ( ornithorhynchus anatinus ) is attributed to the English botanist and zoologist George Shaw, whose first reaction was to believe the specimen to be a hoax, made of several animals sewn together.\n2 Today the platypus is classified as a monotreme : a mammal that can lay eggs, with the male also having a spur on the hind foot that delivers a venom capable of causing severe pain to humans, and with many other structural differences compared to common mammalians.\n3 The notion of \"passing through\" remains a very human way of conceptualizing the question addressed to the measuring apparatus. Indeed, when we say \"passing through,\" or even \"impact point,\" we are already attributing to the electron spatial properties that it does not necessarily have. In other words, we are already looking at things from the bias of our spatial prejudices. On the other hand, if \"passing through\" is more generally understood as a way to express the fact that the only regions of space occupied by the barrier where there is a zero probability of absorbing the electrons are those of the two slits (when they are open), then the notion of \"passing through\" can still be used to conveniently describe the experiment in a way that our human minds can easily understand. A more general and probably more correct way of formulating the above three questions would be: (a) \"What is a good example of an effect produced by an electron interacting with the barrier having only slit 1 open?\" (b) \"What is a good example of an effect produced by an electron interacting with the barrier having only slit 2 open?\" (c) \"What is a good example of an effect produced by an electron interacting with the barrier having both slit 1 and 2 open?\".\n4 These are: Almond, Acorn, Peanut, Olive, Coconut, Raisin, Elderberry, Apple, Mustard, Wheat, Ginger root, Chili pepper, Garlic, Mushroom, Watercress, Lentils, Green pepper, Yam, Tomato, Pumpkin, Broccoli, Rice, Parsley, Black pepper.\n5 To facilitate understanding, we will always denote concepts using italic type fonts and an uppercase first letter, to distinguish them from objects, which we will indicate using roman type fonts.\n6 In our Web analogy, we are assuming that humans are only motivated to create a webpage when it can convey a sufficiently articulated and complex meaning, and that a webpage containing, say, the single word \"horse,\" will not be deemed to be sufficiently interesting to justify the effort (the energy to be spent) for its creation, in the same way that we do not find on the shelves of a bookstore volumes whose pages, except for the cover title, would be all empty. But of course, artifacts of this kind are not in principle impossible to create, and in fact are also created. For instance, in a stationery shop, one can find notebooks, which are volumes without printed words. But a stationery is a very different context from that of library, or of a bookstore.\n7 The conceptuality language is very fluid: a conceptual combination used to describe the state of a conceptual entity can also in turn, depending on the context considered, be interpreted as a composite entity of its own. Here the focus is on the entity Chair , so a combination like The chair is in the bedroom is to be interpreted as a specification of one of its possible states, but The chair is in the bedroom , as a combination of 6 different concepts, can also be interpreted as a multipartite conceptual entity, which in turn can also be in different states.\n8 To conveniently describe the conjunction as a superposition state, the lack of knowledge in question needs to be a deep one, such that one does not even know if the chair is either in the bedroom or in the living room, i.e., if the chair is or not in a spatial state. In other words (see the analysis of the double-slit and delayed choice experiments in Sects. 2, 3), the \"or\" needs to be understood in an non-exclusive way.\n9 In other words, a superposition that is experienced as such by all the material entities playing the role of minds with respect to the proto-language of which the chair would be part of, and not a superposition for the human minds experiencing a doubt regarding the location of the chair, and expressing it by means of the disjunction connective.\n10 The effects of the \"and\" and \"or\" conjunctions as regards making a combination more or less abstract is in fact much more articulated; see for instance the discussions in Aerts (2010b, 2014).\n11 This explains why standard quantum mechanics cannot consistently describe separated physical systems (Aerts 1984); see also Sect. 3 of Aerts (2014).\n12 The CHSH inequality is [Formula omitted], with [Formula omitted], where E (A , B ) denotes the expectation value for the joint measurement AB , given by: [Formula omitted], with [Formula omitted] the probability for obtaining the pair of outcomes [Formula omitted], i.e., (Horse , Growls ), corresponding to the combination The horse growls , and similarly for the other probabilities and joint measurements.\n13 Note that these fluctuations are really such, in the sense that the deviations from the Bose-Einstein \"flat line\" will be generally different when different concepts are considered, say for instance Horse and Cow instead of Cat and Dog , to stay on animals. In other words, the observed deviations from the Bose-Einstein statistics cannot be generally attributed to a systematic classical multiplicity of the states.\n14 This is called an epizeuxis (or palilogia), and is typically used for vehemence, or emphasis.\n15 For example, the modeling of the activity of Broca's area is very different from the modeling of how human language is used, although of course there will be correlates.\n16 See also Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi (2014b), for a discussion of the notion of universal average in relation to Bertrand's paradox.\n17 Of course, not all reference frames are equivalent. For example, when we are on a carousel rotating at a given speed, we will experience phenomena that would be absent if the carousel would be at rest, like the centrifugal pseudo forces . The interesting content of the principle of relativity is therefore that among the countless possible reference frames, some non-trivial ones exist that are perfectly equivalent.\n18 On September 29-30, 2017, the Centre Leo Apostel for Interdisciplinary Studies (CLEA), Belgium, has organized the international symposium \"Worlds of Entanglement,\" during which one of the authors presented the guidelines of the conceptuality interpretation to an heterogeneous audience, formed not only by physicists, but also mathematicians, social scientists, biologists, artists, philosophers, economists, and others. The present article, is an extended version of the content of that presentation.\n19 In a famous article written in 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) recognized that our construction of reality is based on our predictions about it. The original wording of their criterion is Einstein et al. (1935): \"If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty [.] the value of a physical quantity, then there exist an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity.\" For a discussion of the criterion, see Sassoli de Bianchi (2011) and the references cited therein.\n20 VUB being on the surface of planet Earth, strictly speaking it cannot be associated with an inertial frame, but for simplicity we will neglect the planet's non-uniform motion in our reasoning.\n21 Note that we are using a different notation for the two time periods [Formula omitted] and [Formula omitted]. This because the former is a so-called proper time , i.e., a time measured by a clock which remains at rest with respect to A , whereas the latter is a coordinate time , i.e., a time measured by a clock which is not at rest with respect to B .\n22 For simplicity of the discussion, we will neglect that there are also accelerations experienced by B , at her/his departure, turnaround and arrival.\n23 To quote a passage from Einstein (1920) (emphasis is our): \"If the observer perceives the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then they are simultaneous.\"\n24 This means that we are here considering A and B to correspond to the conceptual entities Reasoning of [Formula omitted] and Reasoning of [Formula omitted], respectively.\n25 A single spatial axis is sufficient when considering only two entities. However, additional space axes are needed if further entities are considered; see Aerts (2017).\n26 Hence, two-outcome measurement processes would not constitute the simplest imaginable measurement situation.\n27 This is a view that subtends a notion of realism that was recently introduced and called multiplex realism (Aerts and Sassoli de Bianchi 2017a, d).\n28 The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences (Wigner 1960) becomes all of a sudden less unreasonable if we consider that mathematics is first of all a sophisticated conceptual language and that physical entities interact in a language-mediated conceptual way.\n29 We cannot combine cubic meters to build a house, although its volumetric properties can certainly be expressed in such units."

        "abstract": "I examined the relationship between algorithmic control and gig workers' facades of conformity by investigating the underlying mechanism. Drawing on the challenge--hindrance stress model, I explored the mediating role of challenge stress and hindrance stress in this relationship. Then, by using data collected from an online food delivery platform in China, I demonstrated that hindrance stress positively mediated the relationship between algorithmic control and facades of conformity, but the mediating effect of challenge stress was not significant. This study contributes to the emerging research field of algorithmic control by not only empirically examining its effect on gig workers' psychological and behavioral outcomes, but also exploring the underlying mechanisms between algorithmic control and gig workers' facades of conformity. It offers a reference point and guidance for managers of gig economy enterprises.\nKeywords\nalgorithmic control, facades of conformity, challenge stress, hindrance stress, gig workers\nOver the past decade, the rapid growth of the gig economy has made significant contributions to both domestic and global labor markets (Vallas & Schor, 2020). This emerging form of contingent labor has attracted numerous gig workers who prefer flexible employment (Kuhn & Maleki, 2017). To effectively manage these gig workers, who are dispersed geographically and in large numbers, platform companies have implemented algorithms that utilize various computational formulas (Duggan et al., 2020; Vallas & Schor, 2020). These algorithms employ statistical models and decision rules to direct gig workers without human intervention (Cheng & Hackett, 2021; Kellogg et al., 2020). While algorithmic control can impact gig workers' behavior, its effects can be both positive and negative (Cram et al., 2022; Mohlmann et al., 2021). On the one hand, algorithmic control is considered objectively and mathematically correct, providing customized feedback to help workers improve performance (Crowston & Bolici, 2019). On the other hand, continuous algorithmic monitoring of gig workers and limited flexibility to deviate from instructions have been perceived as a threat to gig workers (Kellogg et al., 2020; Lee, 2018; Mohlmann et al., 2021; Tomprou & Lee, 2022). Given the importance of the gig economy and the potential impact of algorithmic control, it is essential to explore and understand its outcomes.\nThe adoption of facades of conformity is a common phenomenon among gig workers. Facades of conformity refer to situations where individuals outwardly express support for their organization's values while suppressing their own (Hewlin et al., 2016). Previous research indicates that these facades are more prevalent among individuals who perceive their work environment as nonparticipative or who belong to a minority group. It is also reasonable to assume that gig workers, who often work independently and are directed by algorithms, may be susceptible to such facades. While scholars have started examining gig worker's attitudes and behaviors, such as work identity and status inconsistency (Petriglieri et al., 2018), there has been limited attention given to facades of conformity among gig workers. These facades can deplete physical and psychological resources, leading to emotional exhaustion (Chou et al., 2020), low job satisfaction, and a desire to leave the organization (Hewlin, 2009). Therefore, I aimed to investigate the relationship between algorithmic control and gig workers' facades of conformity, as well as to understand the underlying mechanisms.\nDrawing on the challenge-hindrance stress model, I examined why gig workers exhibit facades of conformity under algorithmic control. Challenge stress, which creates opportunities and a sense of achievement, and hindrance stress, which involves demands that hinder one's performance and personal goals, are two distinct types of stress that impact an individual's attitudinal and behavioral outcomes (Cavanaugh et al., 2000). Shi et al. (2022) have additionally demonstrated that daily challenge stress has a positive influence on work engagement, whereas daily hindrance stress has no effect on work engagement. Hence, I posit that the indirect impact of algorithmic control on facades of conformity may differ depending on whether gig workers perceive algorithmic control as challenge stress or hindrance stress. With this in mind, I discuss the mediating effects of challenge stress and hindrance stress on the relationship between algorithmic control and gig workers facades of conformity, based on the challenge-hindrance stress model.\nTheory and Hypotheses\nAlgorithmic Control\nAlgorithmic control is \"an organization's attempt to influence worker behavior by using digital algorithms to enact the control (e.g., to identify a worker behavior that needs to change) and then delivering the control to the work by a technology interface (e.g., smartphone app)\" (Cram et al., 2022, p. 429). Different from organizational control, algorithmic control is based on a computational formula (Duggan et al., 2020; Vallas & Schor, 2020), and it typically relies on ubiquitous and embedded technologies (i.e., mobile apps, smartphones, sensors; Cram et al., 2022). Embedded within digital platforms, algorithms are used to manage gig workers through task assignment, performance evaluation, and compensation. Kellogg et al. (2020) proposed that employers employ algorithms to exert control over workers through six main mechanisms: providing specific recommendations for gig workers' actions, imposing restrictions on gig workers' behaviors, collecting and analyzing data in a detailed manner, utilizing online rating and ranking systems, automatically replacing or removing underperforming workers, and incentivizing behaviors that align with predetermined correct behaviors.\nAlgorithmic Control and Facades of Conformity\nHewlin et al. (2016) stated that facades of conformity are \"false representations created by employees to enable them to appear as if they embrace organizational values\" (p. 541). When organizational values conflict with individuals' values, employees will exhibit conscious behaviors to pretend to support organizations' values and exhibit false behaviors that organizations needed. Recently, related studies investigated the causes of facades of conformity from the work context and individuals' psychology. For example, leader integrity (Hewlin et al., 2015), job insecurity (Hewlin et al., 2016), job strain and workplace bullying (Liang, 2021) have been determined to relate to employees' facades of conformity.\nGig workers who work under algorithmic control may use a facade of agreement (conformity) to obey the rules and demands of the platform. Vallas and Schor (2020) describe the situation where algorithms now fully manage workers and empower firms to an even greater extent as a digital cage. Constant surveillance is used to monitor workers' behaviors, and algorithmic replacement and reward systems are also established for discipline (Kellogg et al., 2020; Rosenblat, 2018). When gig workers do not comply with directives or their rating drops below a certain level, they are banned or punished (Rosenblat, 2018). Additionally, the interactive and dynamic reward depends on the consistency of their behaviors and the predefined correct behaviors (Goods et al., 2019; Rani & Furrer, 2020; Wood et al., 2019). Hence, gig workers must obey the predefined demands even if they do not agree because they need to conform to algorithmic control to gain rewards and avoid punishment.\nHowever, some studies have proposed that gig workers thrive under algorithmic control (Ashford et al., 2018). Although the structural conditions of algorithmic control decrease gig workers' organizationally provided resources, gig workers can attain and maintain their personal resources through career-related behaviors (i.e., resilience and proactivity) and relational behaviors (Ashford et al., 2018). These resources (cognitive capability and emotional capability) enable gig workers to resolve problems proactively and increase their ability to thrive. In addition, many researchers have found that algorithmic control is perceived as fair (Hughes et al., 2019; Jabagi et al., 2020; Shin & Park, 2019; Wong, 2020). With the absence (or minimization) of bias and discrimination, and the accuracy and appropriateness of decisions, algorithms are considered credible and will increases gig workers' trust (Shin & Park, 2019). Given their trust in algorithms, gig workers may commit to the platform company and strive for high performance. I believe that in this case they will not display facades of conformity as that is considered a negative behavior.\nAs such, there may be an underlying mechanism leading to different effects of algorithmic control on gig workers' facades of conformity. In this study I simultaneously consider a positive and a negative path between algorithmic control and facades of conformity based on the model of challenge and hindrance stress to reveal the influential process and deepen understanding of algorithmic control.\nAlgorithmic Control and Gig Workers' Feelings of Work Stress\nCavanaugh et al. (2000) proposed that job demands can be divided into challenge stress and hindrance stress. When individuals feel work demands as challenge stress, the demands will exert potential positive influences on personal gain, growth, development, and well-being. In contrast, when individuals feel work demands as hindrance stress, the demands will result in personal loss, constraints, or harm (LePine et al., 2016), and the individuals will be demotivated to achieve their goals and experience low job satisfaction (Shi et al., 2022). In other words, only when the demands are viewed as challenge stress will individuals respond positively and invest more time and energy in their work. Through algorithms, job demands are transmitted to gig workers. On the one hand, algorithmic control is positively related to challenge stress. First, algorithms are considered fair and impartial (Lee, 2018; Shin & Park, 2019; Wong, 2020). If gig workers obey the demands and complete the work assigned to them, they can gain rewards and be promoted (Wong, 2020). Second, although algorithmic control provides strict criteria (such as completing tasks in a fixed time and banning drunken driving) to regulate gig workers' behaviors, these demands can encourage gig workers to improve their work efficiency and ensure their safety (Kellogg et al., 2020). Third, algorithmic control often provides gig workers with timely feedback to help them resolve problems at work and remind them to improve work quality (Parent-Rocheleau & Parker, 2022; Wallace et al., 2009). In addition, a series of competitive work games have been designed in algorithms to encourage workers to challenge themselves and earn more (Cram et al., 2022). These algorithmic demands can increase gig workers' income, improve their work efficiency, and promote their challenge appraisal. Accordingly, I proposed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: Algorithmic control will be positively related to challenge stress.\nOn the other hand, algorithmic control can elicit gig workers' feelings of hindrance stress. First, continuous surveillance has been blamed for invading gig workers' privacy (Ayyagari et al., 2011). For example, Uber tracks drivers' activities closely, including where they go and what route they take (Mohlmann et al., 2021). In addition, drivers' age, gender, education level, and criminal convictions are monitored via algorithms (Sessions et al., 2021). These demands inhibit gig workers from changing their work habits or working outside the rules. Second, gig workers often work independently, which increases their sense of loneliness and tension during work (Wood et al., 2019). They attempt to communicate with one another to obtain a sense of belonging and organizational identification (Mohlmann et al., 2021; Rosenblat, 2018). Third, to keep pace with technological changes, algorithms add new functions and update the operating system irregularly. The continuous change may provide more rigorous demands and require that gig workers learn new skills and knowledge constantly, which may increase their pressures and strains (Curchod et al., 2020). Based on these arguments, I proposed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2: Algorithmic control will be positively related to hindrance stress.\nWork Stress and Facades of Conformity\nAs mentioned, challenge stress and hindrance stress are two categories of stress that have differing effects on individuals: Challenge stress is considered motivating, inspiring, and challenging, and hindrance stress is demotivating (Cavanaugh et al., 2000). When algorithmic control is perceived as a form of challenge stress, the demands placed on gig workers are viewed as meaningful, valuable, and rewarding (Liu & Ren, 2022; Xia et al., 2020). Consequently, I believe gig workers are more likely to respond positively and allocate additional time and resources to successfully accomplish their assigned tasks. The completion of each task and the achievement of goals can increase gig workers' confidence (Shi et al., 2022). Previous research has verified that challenge stress is associated with individuals' positive outcomes such as job satisfaction, work engagement (Shi et al., 2022), positive affect, and career initiative (Liu & Ren, 2022). Thus, I proposed that gig workers who consider algorithms control as challenge stress will not create facades of conformity, which is a type of negative behavior. They will be more likely to engage in their work and eager for higher performance and will not passively treat the assignment task. Thus, I proposed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 3: Challenge stress will be negatively related to facades of conformity.\nIn contrast, I propose that when gig workers consider algorithmic control as hindrance stress, they will be likely to exhibit facades of conformity. The work assigned by algorithms will be considered unmanageable and unattainable. In this case, gig workers will experience nervousness and become pressured if they cannot obey the demands and complete the work because they will be punished or even fired. To increase their awards and obtain better impressions, gig workers will attempt to use impression tactics to influence the evaluation of algorithms. Thus, gig workers feeling hindrance stress will tend to suppress their values, conform to the rules and measures of algorithms, and exhibit fake behaviors (i.e., facades of conformity) to earn their rewards. Therefore, I proposed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 4: Hindrance stress will be positively related to facades of conformity.\nDrawing on the challenge-hindrance stress model (Cavanaugh et al., 2000), I propose potential mechanisms between algorithmic control and gig workers' facades of conformity. Specifically, I suggest that algorithmic control may cause gig workers to feel challenge stress and hindrance stress. In turn, the feeling of hindrance stress may result in gig workers' facades of conformity, while the feeling of challenge stress may be not related to facades of conformity. Therefore, I proposed the following two hypotheses:\nHypothesis 5: The indirect effect of algorithmic control on gig workers' facades of conformity through challenge stress will be positive.\nHypothesis 6: The indirect effect of algorithmic control on gig workers' facades of conformity through hindrance stress will be negative.\nThe theoretical model is shown in Figure 1.",

        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants and Procedure\nTo test the model and hypotheses in this study, a survey instrument was developed and distributed to delivery persons from an online food delivery platform in China called Meituan. The data collection took place during May and August 2022. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, questionnaires were distributed online. I contacted a region manager in a big city in central China, and he agreed to provide help. A total of 245 riders participated in the survey. I adopted a two-wave study to minimize common method bias, and the participants were told that the questionnaires were anonymous and only for academic research purposes.\nAll procedures in this study were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of Taiyuan Institute of Technology, as well as the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its subsequent amendments, or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants in the study.\nIn the first-wave survey, participants were invited to provide their demographic information (gender, age, education level, and daily work hours) and the survey measured their algorithmic control and facades of conformity. I collected 228 questionnaires. One month later, I conducted the second-wave survey among these respondents, and measured challenge stress and hindrance stress. A total of 214 questionnaires were returned. After excluding fifteen responses with incomplete information, the final sample consisted of 199 useful responses. Among the respondents, 149 (74.9%) were men and 50 (25.1%) were women. In terms of age distribution, 4 (2.0%) of participants were below 20 years old, 44 (22.1%) were aged 21-25, 42 (21.1%) were 26-30, 51 (25.6%) were 31-35, 33 (16.6%) were 36-40, and 25 (12.6%) were 41 or above. Regarding the educational background of the participants, 95 (47.7%) had obtained a high school education or lower, 37 (18.6%) possessed a vocational or technical school education, 43 (21.6%) held a college degree, 22 (11.1%) held a bachelor's degree, and 2 (1%) had a postgraduate degree. Among the participants, 37 (18.6%) reported working fewer than 8 hours per day, 102 (51.2%) worked between 8 and 10 hours, and 60 (30.2%) worked more than 10 hours per day.\nMeasures\nThe surveys were initially developed in English, so I translated them to Chinese using the back-translation procedure developed by Brislin (1980). All items in this study were assessed using a five-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).\nAlgorithmic Control\nI measured algorithmic control using the eleven items from an output control measurement model proposed by Weibel et al. (2016). A sample item is \"Algorithms tell me about the level of achievement expected on sales volume or market share targets.\" Cronbach's alpha was .93, indicating that the measure was reliable.\nChallenge Stress and Hindrance Stress\nI adopted a five-item and a four-item scale developed by Cavanaugh et al. (2000) to measure challenge stress and hindrance stress, respectively. A sample item for challenge stress is \"I have huge responsibility,\" and a sample item for hindrance stress is \"Politics rather than performance always affects organizational decisions.\" Cronbach's alpha for challenge stress and hindrance stress were .85 and .79, respectively, indicating that the measures were reliable.\nFacades of Conformity\nI employed the six-item scale by Hewlin (2009) to measure gig workers' facades of conformity. A sample item was \"I behave in a manner that obeys algorithms' demands even though I do not agree with them.\" Cronbach's alpha was .75, indicating that the measure was reliable.\nControl Variables\nThe gender, age, education, and daily work hours of the participants in this study were controlled to reduce false results caused by probable effects of demographic characteristics, as done in previous research on facades of conformity (Chou et al., 2020; Liang, 2021).\nValidity and Reliability\nFirst, I conducted a series of confirmatory factor analyses to assess the discriminant validity of the key variables used in the study. I employed an item-to-construct balance technique (Little et al., 2002) to create item parcels of algorithmic control, which included three parcels (two parcels containing four items each, and one parcel containing three items). Other variables were not parceled because of having too few items. A hypothesized four-factor model was compared with three alternative models, and, as shown in Table 1, it produced a better fit than alternative models with perceived algorithmic control, challenge stress, hindrance stress, and facades of conformity items.\nSecond, the descriptive statistics of the variables are presented in Table 2. The results indicate that all reliability estimates (the Cronbach's alpha values) for the variables exceed .7. Also, composite reliability and average variance extracted index (AVE) indicated good convergent validity. According to Table 2, the square root of AVE for each variable was greater than the correlations between pairs of constructs, providing evidence of discriminant validity (Fornell & Larcker, 1981).\nFirst, the results of this study contribute to the literature on algorithmic control, which is an emerging research area. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the gig economy and algorithms, with several studies focusing on theoretical research. For instance, investigations have examined the activities performed by platforms (Vallas & Schor, 2020), the impact of algorithmic management on job design (Parent-Rocheleau & Parker, 2022), and the exploration of a research agenda for employment relations and human resource management (Duggan et al., 2020). Only a few scholars have adopted empirical methods to study the effects of algorithmic control, such as Wiener et al. (2021) and Cram et al. (2022). Contributing to the limited empirical research, my study investigated the relationship between algorithmic control and gig workers' facades of conformity, which is an important and negative behavior that relates to low job satisfaction (Chou et al., 2020). In addition, I have expanded the understanding of the outcomes of gig workers who work under algorithmic control. While previous studies have suggested the positive or negative impacts of algorithmic control, they did not concentrate on specific types (e.g., facades of conformity) of gig workers' actions. It is a significant gap, as Hewlin (2009) discovered that the facades of conformity could boost members' plans to exit the organization. This research examined the indirect consequences of algorithmic control on gig workers' facades of conformity and uncovered the underlying mechanism, which enhances the knowledge of the effects of algorithmic control.\nSecond, my study contributes to the challenge-hindrance stress model (Cavanaugh et al., 2000) by revealing an important psychological mechanism to explain the effect of algorithmic control on gig workers' negative behaviors. Prior research adopted the challenge-hindrance stress model to explain the antecedent of employees' behaviors and performance (Mitchell et al., 2019). From the perspective of individuals' feelings of stress, this study finds that the feeling of hindrance stress due to algorithmic control can incur a positive effect on facades of conformity, but the relationship between the feeling of challenging stress and facades of conformity is not significant. These findings contribute to the research on gig workers and provide a clear view of the influence of algorithmic control on gig workers' psychology and behaviors. In addition, this study has found that algorithmic control can promote both challenge and hindrance stress, consistent with the observation that most work demands can elicit a mix of positive and negative stress in individuals (Bliese et al., 2017; Nelson & Simmons, 2003).\nThird, this study broadens the understanding of the antecedents of facades of conformity. Although previous studies have found that workplace behaviors, such as compulsory citizenship behavior, workplace bullying, and insecure attachment, significantly influence facades of conformity (Cheng et al., 2022; Liang, 2021), they did not focus on algorithmic control as a specific management model. In response to the call by Hewlin et al. (2016) for more research to deepen the understanding of facades of conformity, my study investigated the direct and indirect effects of algorithmic control on gig workers' facades of conformity. The results support my hypotheses and complement the literature on facades of conformity from the perspective of algorithmic control.\nThis study provides some valuable implications for platform companies and gig workers. With the increasing development of the gig economy, algorithms are used more and more to manage gig workers. It is important to know how to utilize algorithmic control to regulate gig workers' behaviors. First, platform companies should optimize algorithmic management, such as enhancing protection measures to prevent disclosure of gig workers' privacy, increasing the transparency of the algorithmic process, and designing more convenient feedback channels for gig workers. These approaches may increase gig workers' trust and improve their work willingness. Second, platforms should pay attention to gig workers' psychological health and improve algorithms to increase work interest, such as conducting mental health surveys, designing recreation games online, or organizing entertaining activities, which will prevent emotional exhaustion in gig workers and increase their well-being.\nThis study has several limitations. First, although the research explores the effect of algorithmic control on facades of conformity via stress, boundary conditions were not considered, which may influence the mediating effects. Future research could address this limitation by examining factors such as gig workers' proactive personality (Bergeron et al., 2014), algorithm transparency (Shin & Park, 2019), and the environment characteristics (Iqbal et al., 2021) to revisit the impact of algorithmic control on gig workers' behavior. Second, the data used in this study were obtained from only one source, introducing the possibility of common method variance. To mitigate this limitation, future research could collect data from multiple sources and levels. Third, the generalizability of my findings is constrained as the data were collected exclusively from gig workers in China, whereas attitudes towards algorithmic control may vary among individuals in different countries. To enhance the external validity of my findings, future researchers could conduct surveys among gig workers from diverse countries.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (21BGL146), Taiyuan Institute of Technology Scientific Research Initial Funding (2022KJ067), and Program for the (Reserved) Discipline Leaders of Taiyuan Institute of Technology (2020XKRW02).\nThe author declares no conflict of interest.\nBrislin, R.

Thus, Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 were supported, respectively.\nAs shown in Figure 2, hindrance stress was positively related to facades of conformity, thus Hypothesis 4 was supported. However, the coefficient between challenge stress and facades of conformity was not significant, thus Hypothesis 3 was not supported. Although the direct link between algorithmic control and facades of conformity was not significant, a mediation model without this direct link was tested. This mediation model also achieved a better fit to the data.\nFinally, I conducted bootstrapping analyses to confirm the mediating role of challenge stress and hindrance stress, respectively (see Table 3). The results of bootstrapping analysis, k = 5000, revealed that the indirect effect between algorithmic control and facades of conformity through hindrance stress was significant. Thus, Hypothesis 6 was supported. However, the indirect effect between algorithmic control and facades of conformity through challenge stress was not significant.

        "abstract": "The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is an assessment tool designed to measure one's learning history with respect to preexisting verbal relations (Bames-Holmes, Hayden, Bames-Holmes, & Stewart, 2008). Responses to stimuli are regarded as implicit because they are measured with respect to the associated response latencies and accuracy, or brief and immediate relational responding (BIRRs; Hughes & Bames-Holmes, 2013, p. 104). This study used the modified (MD) IRAP to select stimuli that were presented in motivational statements in a simulated work task to increase cooperative and conformity responding. Participants came into contact with customized motivational statements promoting cooperative and conformity responding in conditions with a competing pay-for-performance contingency using an alternating treatments design. Results showed that motivational statements temporarily increased cooperative and conformity responding. Moreover, those participants identified as having a stronger history with particular stimuli, as identified in the MD IRAP, chose to cooperate and conform at higher and more sustained rates. The coherence between implicit responding, as demonstrated in the MD IRAP, and explicit responding, as demonstrated in the simulated work task, and the implications it has on prosocial behaviors will be discussed.\nKeywords Cooperation * Conformity * Rule-governed behavior * Motivative augmentals * IRAP",
        "introduction": "Introduction\nOrganizations have largely relied on consequential payment manipulations to increase particular employee behaviors. Indeed, scholars have found that increased performance is often tied to a financial consequence (Rafacz, Houmanfar, Smith, & Levin, 2019). In addition, motivational messages in analog work settings have been shown to enhance financial consequences when the message is relevant to the behavior that produces a financial consequence (Candido, 2013; Rafacz et al., 2019). For example, motivational messages promoting cooperation between participants have been shown to increase cooperative behavior when the financial contingency to cooperate is aligned (e.g., cooperation results in positive financial consequence). When a motivational message to cooperate with a partner does not cohere with a financial consequence (e.g., cooperation results in no financial consequence and working alone results in a financial consequence), cooperative behavior only temporarily increases (Candido, 2013; Rafacz et ah, 2019). Messages that promote a certain behavior at the expense of a particular consequence can also be seen outside of organizational settings. Some social settings may promote cooperative behaviors that are eventually rewarded but compete with immediate individual consequences. For example, volunteering is regarded as cooperative behavior and often occurs without any immediate programmed, tangible reinforcer and may conflict with direct individual consequences (Brayko, Houmanfar, & Ghezzi, 2016). Voting behavior and political participation are also regarded as examples of \"conditional cooperation\"--cooperating only if those around us are willing to do the same (Rolfe, 2012). However, donating time or money to an organization or voting rarely results in contacting the immediate consequences of our behavior (e.g., end result of volunteering, reaping benefits of elected politician) and may compete with the direct individual consequences for doing so (e.g., loss of time, money).\nCooperative behavior as defined by behavior analysts requires \"the combined behavior of two or more organisms\" (Keller & Schoenfeld, 1950, p. 357) wherein \"the reinforcement of two or more individuals depends upon the behavior of both\" (Skinner, 1953, p. 311). However, maintaining cooperative behavior (e.g., employee engagement, volunteering, voting) with no clear shared outcome and at the expense of individual immediate tangible consequences may not fit the behavior analytic definition of cooperation. In formal terms, two individuals may appear to be behaving in cooperation, but behavior analysts might argue that the direct-acting contingency is a verbal consequence that lacks a shared outcome, which is considered a necessary variable in many definitions of cooperation (Guerin, 1994; Hake & Vukelich, 1972; Schmitt, 1984).\nThe probability that an individual will cooperate when a shared outcome is absent has been studied in other fields of psychology, including social psychology. Romano and Balliet (2017) studied the conditions under which people cooperated in a prisoner's dilemma task and found that cooperation was more likely when the behavior was reciprocated with a partner rather than when cooperation was promoted as conforming to a group norm with no partner reciprocity. When participants were told that their partner had been cooperative on previous trials, but the group had not been promotive of cooperation, participants were more likely to cooperate based on their partner's behavior and not the history of the group. Reciprocity assumes a shared outcome that is not achievable by one individual acting alone, which fits the behavior analytic definition of cooperation (Guerin, 1994; Hake & Vukelich, 1972; Schmitt, 1984). However, conforming to group norms in order to promote cooperation may not fit a behavior analytic definition of cooperation. Conforming as an explanation for cooperative behavior lacks a shared outcome contingent on two or more individuals behaving, but may help to explain those behaviors that were previously regarded as cooperative (e.g., employee cooperation at the expense of individual compensation). Verbal behavior may also help to explain the conditions under which an individual conforms when no direct-acting consequence or reciprocity is apparent. For example, an individual may generate the rule, \"If I cooperate, I am a good employee\" or \"If I vote for X, then I am part of this group.\" In this context, the consequence for engaging in a particular behavior is being a good employee or being part of a particular group, which reinforces the rule follower's behavior. This is in contrast to engaging in a particular behavior that is contingent on another individual and results in a shared outcome. Therefore, some behaviors that have been regarded as cooperative may be better explained as conformity, behavior maintained by a social influence.\nAlthough there is a large research base in behavior analytic journals regarding cooperative behavior, we are mainly limited to social psychological research on conformity behavior that is ambiguous and neglects to consider contextual factors (Padalia, 2014). One growing area of research in behavior analysis that looks at the role socially mediated consequences have on mle-govemed behavior is the study of generalized pliance (O'Conner et al., 2019; Ruiz et ah, 2019; Tomeke, Luciano, & Salas, 2008). Generalized pliance, like the social psychological conceptualization of conformity, is behavior that becomes insensitive to direct-acting contingencies wherein \"social approval becomes the main source of reinforcement for the individual\" (Ruiz et ah, 2019, p.190). In a recent study on generalized pliance, O'Conner et ah (2019) found that scores on the Generalized Pliance Questionnaire (GPQ) strongly correlated with results on two measures of insensitivity to contingencies: the Wisconsin Sorting Test (WCST) and the Contingency-shifting variant Iowa Gambling Task (csIGT). Participants who reported higher levels of \"pliant rule-following\" (p. 837) on the GPQ were less likely to be sensitive to the changing contingencies in the WCST and csIGT. Measures like the GPQ and the IRAP allow behavior analysis to contribute substantially to the experimental analysis of rigid socially mediated rule-following (i.e., generalized pliance) commonly referred to as conformity, and the implications this analysis may have on large-scale social issues.\nConformity from a Social Psychological and Behavior Analytic Perspective\nAlthough there are many definitions and subtypes of conformity found in the social psychological literature, Crutchfield (1955) defined conformity as \"yielding to group pressures\" (p. 193). Since then, social psychological research has distinguished between two motivational factors for conformity: informational and normative factors (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955). Social psychologists have since held to these two conceptually independent factors, however interrelated (David & Turner, 2001). In 2004, Cialdini and Goldstein added an additional motivational factor to account for the conditions under which one conforms, which the authors refer to as \"maintaining selfconcept\" (p. 611).\nWe can analyze these three motivational factors from a behavior analytic perspective that further highlights the interrelation and helps to draw a distinction between conformity and cooperation. Cialdini and Goldstein (2004) define informational conformity as \"the desire to form an accurate interpretation of reality and behave correctly\" (p. 606). Several studies (Asch, 1951; Jenness, 1932; Meade & Roediger, 2002; Walther et al., 2002) have looked at how participants conform to information supplied by confederates when \"reconstructing their memories for stimuli\" (Cialdini & Rosenstein, 2004, p. 606). If we describe behavior analytically, explicit information derived from the group (confederates) serves as an antecedent prompt to occasion the \"correct\" response in the presence of some discriminative stimulus. Information from the group serves as a stimulus prompt that operates directly on the antecedent stimulus directing an individual to a correct response (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007). In this instance, the stimulus prompt is necessarily social as it is the social environment that may punish a select \"bad\" behavior (i.e., incorrect) and reinforce \"good\" behavior (i.e., correct; Skinner, 1953). What is considered the \"correct\" response is not necessarily the direct consequence of behavior but rather the socially mediated consequences of responding in agreement with the group.\nCialdini and Goldstein (2004) define normative conformity as \"the goal of obtaining social approval from others\" (p. 606). Individuals engage in normative conformity to \"gain the social approval of others, build rewarding relationships with them, and in the process, to enhance their self-esteem\" (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004, p. 610). Similar to informative conformity, an individual behaves with respect to some antecedent stimulus in order to come into contact with a reinforcing consequence, in this case a group-provided social consequence. Skinner (1974) discusses conformity as it pertains to differentially reinforcing individual behavior through community standards. The community thus functions as a reinforcing or punishing environment. The social environment steps in to punish certain behaviors or reinforce certain behaviors. The presence of the group therefore serves as a motivating operation and alters the reinforcing value of responding in accordance with the group. If a particular behavior produces reinforcement (e.g., social approval or negative reinforcement) it will increase the current frequency of that particular behavior (i.e., conforming).\nSelf-concept, or the goal of maintaining a positive selfconcept, are instances when \"people are frequently motivated to conform to others' beliefs and behaviors in order to enhance, protect, or repair their self-esteems\" (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004, p. 611). Being \"right\" as it relates to a conceptualized group is therefore highly valued. To address this factor, as well as informational conformity and normative conformity, we look to Relational Frame Theory (RFT) and one's listener-generated rules and values with respect to rule-governed behavior. If an individual is primarily controlled by socially mediated consequences like being \"right\" or values being part of a particular group, then conforming is reinforcing. Correspondence between behavior and rules about what is \"right\" is based on a history of arbitrary socially mediated consequences (Hayes, Bames-Homes, & Roche, 2001). This may lead to ineffective behavior as an individual may behave as \"they ought to\" rather than tracking the short- and longterm consequences of such rule following (O'Conner et al., 2019; Ruiz et al., 2019; Tomeke et al., 2008). Although rulegoverned behavior under the control of a history of socially mediated consequences is not problematic (for a the discussion on pliance, see Hayes et al., 2001), an arbitrary relation of coordination between being \"accepted,\" \"right,\" \"good,\" and verbally constructed consequences related to socially mediated consequences may strengthen one's repertoire of ineffective and rigid rule-following and insensitivity to changing contingencies (O'Conner et al., 2019; Ruiz et al, 2019; Tomeke et al., 2008). Conforming therefore involves characteristics of verbally mediated contingencies of group practices and social consequences regarding mle-govemed behavior. As a result, social consequences may ultimately prevail and prevent sensitivity to the direct consequences of behavior, hindering a transition from pliance to tracking (O'Conner et al., 2019; Tomeke et al., 2008).\nCooperation from a Social Psychological and Behavior Analytic Perspective\nSocial psychologist Morton Deutsch defines cooperative relations as \"those in which the goals of the parties involved are predominately positively interdependent\" (Deutsch, Coleman, & Marcus, 2006, p. 5). This definition encompasses two specific similarities with several behavior analytic definitions of cooperation. \"Positively interdependent goals of parties\" assumes 1) two or more individuals behaving to 2) produce a shared outcome not achievable by one behaving alone (Guerin, 1994; Hake & Vukelich, 1972; Keller & Schoenfeld, 1950; Schmitt, 1984; Skinner, 1953, 1974). Deutsch et al. (2006) organized cooperative relations into six groups that make cooperation more likely: the conditions under which someone engages in cooperative behavior. The two characteristics that draw a parallel to the behavior analytic definitions of cooperation are effective communication and sense of agreement.\nEffective communication is \"when ideas are verbalized, and group members are attentive to one another, accepting of the ideas of other members, and influenced by them ... which lead to mutual benefits\" (Deutsch et al., 2006, p. 5). Deutsch et al. explain that effective communication results in group members having less difficulty communicating and understanding communication within the group. The behavior analytic explanation of \"effective communication\" is that rules are explicitly or implicitly verbalized and effectively relate to the consequence. Similar to Hake and Vukelich's (1972) definition of cooperation, effective communication involves more than one person, acting in accordance with one or more individuals that results in the group contacting similar consequences. Cooperative behavior in this instance requires both parties to behave to produce an outcome one cannot obtain by behaving alone. The direct-acting contingency, therefore, for cooperating with effective communication is the natural consequence stated in the rule. From an RFT perspective, behavior is, \"under the control of the apparent correspondence between the rule and the way the world is arranged,\" the behavior that is specified in the rule produces the consequence that was also specified in the rule (Hayes et al., 2001, p. 109).\nSense of agreement is \"a basic sense of similarity in beliefs and values, as well as confidence in one's own ideas and in the value that other members have to those ideas\" (Deutsch et al., 2006, p. 6). One's values, and the listener-generated rules related to those values, align with others in the group. Group members share similar values, and therefore a potential shared outcome, or as Guerin (1994) defines cooperation: \"Cooperation is controlled by remote contingencies contacted by group members and only by group members acting in concert\" (p. 127). Whether the contingency is direct or remote, behavior is performed and some joint consequence is contacted. For example, collaborating with a colleague on a project results in a shared outcome with a direct contingency (e.g., the completion of the project) and a remote contingency (e.g., praise or recognition from leadership to you and your colleague).\nThe Distinction between Conformity and Cooperation\nFrom a behavior analytic point of view, the distinction between conformity and cooperation seems to be functional, not formal. Conformity and cooperation can be considered two types of social behavior (e.g., helping, sharing, altruism, competition). The distinction, however, may be that cooperation is to achieve some shared outcome not achievable by one individual behaving alone (cooperation as defined by Guerin, 1994; Hake & Vukelich, 1972; Keller & Schoenfeld, 1950; Schmitt, 1984; Skinner, 1953, 1974). In the case of conformity, there is no clearly shared outcome between two or more individuals behaving. One instead comes under control of a particular social influence and acts accordingly, wherein the outcome can be entirely abstract, verbally constructed, and socially mediated. A potential outcome of conformity includes a general sensitivity to consequences provided by others (perceived or real) and insensitivity to the direct outcome or consequences of behavior, what behavior analysis refers to as generalized pliance (O'Conner et al., 2019; Ruiz et al., 2019; Tomeke et al., 2008). Conformity behavior is more susceptible to rigid rule following given an individual's history of responding under the control of socially mediated consequences that may lead to maladaptive rule following. Cooperative behavior is associated with variation in individual responding (see effective communication above) to produce a shared outcome. Therefore, cooperative behavior is more susceptible to flexible rule following, sensitive to changing contingencies, and the factors involved to produce commensurate consequences.\nRafacz et al.'s (2019) looked at the effect motivational statements had on responding in the presence of changing financial contingencies. The study presented motivational statements in an analog medical data entry task that promoted cooperative responding (defined as \"fix partner errors\") as opposed to working independently (defined as \"working alone\"). Conditions were arranged such that a cooperative response in one condition resulted in a neutral financial contingency (profit share: \"fix partner errors\" or \"working alone\" choice resulted in money), and in another condition a cooperative response resulted in a competing contingency (piece rate: \"working alone\" choice only resulted in money). Results showed that in the presence of a motivational statement promoting cooperative responding, participants were more likely to select \"fix partner errors\" in conditions when the financial contingency to do so was neutral. When in a condition where the direct-acting financial contingency was promotive of working alone, motivational statements had little to no effect on participants selecting to \"fix partner errors\" and were more likely to select to \"work alone.\" In sum, the authors found that participants were more likely to be sensitive to the direct-acting financial contingency rather than a socially mediated rule (motivational statements) to cooperate.\nIn line with Rafacz et al.'s (2019) experimental procedure, this study considered a response cooperative when a participant selected to \"fix partner errors\" and a response as independent when the participant selected to \"work alone.\" In this study, however, the financial contingency was modified wherein the piece rate financial contingency to \"work alone\" was held across experimental conditions. Therefore, in all experimental conditions with a motivational statement a cooperative response to \"fix partner errors\" never resulted in a positive consequence whereas an independent response of \"work alone\" always resulted in an immediate positive financial consequence. Similar to Rafacz et al.'s findings, participants who 1) initially selected \"fix partner errors\" but quickly transitioned to \"work alone\" or 2) exclusively selected \"work alone\" were considered to be responding to the direct-acting contingency. Unlike Rafacz et al.'s findings, this study identified participants who maintained their selection of \"fix partner errors\" rather than transition to the alternate response to \"work alone\" in the presence of a competing financial contingency. These participants may have been responding to a social influence, in particular the motivational message presented in the condition and were insensitive to the direct financial contingency.\nFunctional Account of Rule Governed Behavior and Motivative Augmentals\nWhether the other individual or partner was physically present or not, a cooperative or conformity response involved one individual behaving with a stimulus that functionally substituted for another individual. Given that this study focused on the conditions under which cooperative and conformity messages functioned as rules, specifically motivative augmentals, conformity and cooperative behavior in these instances were verbal. Examining how verbal rules affect behavior can be analyzed through an RFT lens (Hayes et al., 2001). RFT provides a liinctional account of rule-governance and the conditions under which rules influence behavior. Through transfer of stimulus function, verbal stimuli come to act as rules that, \"represent 'contingency specifying' and 'functioning altering' stimuli\" (Kissi et al., 2017, p. 2). According to RFT, there are at least three distinct classes of mle-govemed behavior: pliance, tracking, and augmenting (Hayes et al., 1989, p. 203). Based on previous research (Candido, 2013; Maraccini, Houmanfar, & Szarko, 2016; Rafacz et al., 2019), analyzing cooperative and conformity behavior using the framework of augmentals was most appropriate. Augmenting is defined as \"rule-governed behavior under the control of apparent changes in the capacity of events to function as reinforcers or punishers\" (Hayes, 1989, p. 206) and \"is most important for the establishment of abstract consequences such as fairness, justice, peace, or righteousness\" (Hayes, Gifford, & Hayes, 1998, p. 262). Augmentals fall under two classes: formative and motivative. A motivative augmental is rulegoverned behavior that is controlled by, \"relational networks that temporarily alter the degree to which previously established consequences function as reinforcers or punishers\" (Hayes et al., 2001, p. 109). For example, an employee is working on a complex and difficult work task and as their boss passes the employee's desk the boss says, \"Hard work and dedication is the backbone of this company.\" If this verbal stimulus temporarily increases the likelihood that the employee continues to work on the task and work even harder on the task, then it is likely the verbal stimulus is functioning as a motivative augmental. The role of motivative and formative augmentals as related to organizational applications (e.g., buy-in, work productivity, retention) has received growing attention of researchers and practitioners in behavior analysis (Houmanfar, Rodrigues, & Smith, 2009; Maraccini et al., 2016; O'Hora & Maglieri, 2006; Rafacz et al., 2019; Stewart, Bames-Holmes, Bames-Holmes, Bond, & Hayes, 2006).\nThe distinction between cooperative stimuli and conformity stimuli and their potential to function as motivative augmentals may have important implications in workplace settings and large-scale social issues (e.g. employee productivity, political participation, policy adherence). Although cooperative responding has been shown to increase when participants are paid to cooperate (for a discussion of this in profit sharing conditions, see Rafacz et al., 2019), promoting meaningful behavior change in an organization and beyond requires more than financial and consequential contingencies as a sole intervention (Candido, 2013; Maraccini et al., 2016; Rafacz et al., 2019). The verbal history of an individual arbitrarily relating stimuli must be considered when assessing a person's likelihood to respond (e.g., cooperate or conform) in a given situation.\nRelational responses are regarded as learned operants that include an individual's discrimination of the relevant functional relationship between two or more stimuli (e.g., \"cooperating makes me a good person\"; Hayes et al., 2001, pp. 22-24). Moreover, implicit responses are considered relational responses, learned from interactions with stimuli in the environment over multiple exemplars. When a stimulus is presented, a relational response may occur relatively quickly, for example, seeing the stimulus \"cooperation\" and immediately thinking, \"I'm cooperative!\" These quick relational responses are known as brief and immediate relational responses (BIRRs) and can be assessed using the IRAP. Relational responding is considered explicit when the individual who is responding to stimuli (e.g., motivational message to cooperate in an analog work task) has a \"sufficient\" amount of time to alter their response (in general, 3 s or more). These delayed responses are known as extended and elaborated relational responses (EERRs; Bames-Holmes et al., 2010a, b). Both BIRRs and EERRs can be part of the same behavioral process of arbitrary relational responding, but under different time parameters. The Relational Elaboration and Coherence Model (REC) argues that the verbal community reinforces coherence between implicit and explicit relational responding, and punishes incoherence (Bames-Holmes et al., 2010a, b). Previous research has shown that a stronger reinforcement history with a cooperative verbal stimulus (e.g., \"team player\"), as identified in the IRAP, the more likely a person will respond cooperatively following the presentation of that verbal stimulus embedded in a cooperative message in an explicit analog work task (e.g., \"being a team player is highly valued\"; Candido, 2013). Rafacz et al. (2019) also found that participants were more likely to cooperate in conditions when cooperation was aligned with a positive financial consequence and less likely to cooperate in conditions when the financial consequence was promotive of working alone. In addition, cooperative messages were found to only temporarily (if at all) increase cooperative responding in those conditions when cooperative behavior did not result in a positive financial consequence.\nThis study extended the abovementioned research (Rafacz et al., 2019) by introducing in addition to cooperative motivational statements, motivational conformity statements to assess an individual's level of cooperation or conformity responding (e.g., selecting to \"fix partner errors\") under a competing financial contingency in an analog work task. By introducing conformity statements, the authors sought to increase the probability a participant would select \"fix partner errors\" based on a more explicit socially mediated consequence for doing so (e.g., compliance is highly valued). The study also examined the function of the motivational statements as motivative augmentals. Motivative augmentals, when interacting with other rule-governed behavior (i.e., tracking or pliance), decrease the sensitivity to changing contingencies and instead increase the sensitivity and reinforcing value of more abstract controlling consequences (Tomeke et al., 2008). In Phase 1 of the experiment, a modified IRAP was used to identify each individual's history with specific cooperative and conformity stimuli in order to select the top two stimuli from each list that evoked a strong positive relational response. These stimuli were used to generate individualized motivational statements for each participant in the second phase. In Phase 2, participants completed an analog data entry work task with conditions that presented personalized motivational statements meant to promote cooperative or conformity responding with a financially competing contingency and choice behavior was measured (fixing partner errors vs. working alone).",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants and Setting\nA power analysis was conducted to establish the necessary sample size to determine statistically significant effects using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). A baseline effect size was determined using data from Candido (2013), which provided a reasonable estimate of the relative magnitude of the effects to be measured in this study. Subsequent to establishing the likely effect size and design of study, an a priori power analysis (G*Power; Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, & Lang, 2009) was performed for a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures. The results indicated a recommended sample size of 20 or more participants.\nParticipants were 67 undergraduate students. Forty-seven (70%) participants were female, 19 (28%) participants were male, and 1 participant (1%) did not disclose the gender to which they identify. Sixty-two (93%) participants were between the ages 18 and 25. Participants were compensated with extra credit (3 credits), and the dollar amount they earned during the Phase 2 data entry task. All sessions were conducted in two small laboratory rooms on a university campus containing two desks and two PC desktop computers.\nPhase 1: IRAP\nThis experiment involved two different phases (MD IRAP and data entry task). Phase 1 required participants to complete an MD IRAP using stimuli within cooperative and conformity response classes, based on the results from an IRAP stimuli survey. An IRAP stimuli selection survey was included as classes of stimuli are \"critical in determining the internal reliability and predictive validity of the IRAP\" (Hughes & Bames-Holmes, 2013, p. 115). Minor differences in stimuli can have subtle changes on IRAP performance, thus making stimuli selection integral. Therefore, a more systemic and objective method for stimuli selection was warranted. A threequestion online Qualtrics[C] survey was created asking participants to rank from strongest (1) to weakest (10) synonyms that best describe the terms: \"conforming with others\" and \"working with others\" (see Table 1 for survey results). Participants for the IRAP stimuli selection survey included 355 undergraduate students who were compensated for their participation with extra credit (1 credit). The top four words from each category were selected and used in an MD IRAP based on the closest mean to 1, or strongest association to the terms \"conforming with others\" and \"working with others.\" Those students who participated in the IRAP stimuli selection survey were excluded from participating in this study.\nThe IRAP is an empirically validated assessment tool that measures the latency and consistency of the participants' responses to a given set of stimuli presented on a computer screen (Bames-Holmes et al, 2008). Previous work using the IRAP captures the implicit attitudes of participants and the predictive utility of those results in relevant experimental settings (Bames-Holmes et al., 2010a, b; Candido, 2013; Cullen, Bames-Holmes, Bames-Holmes, & Stewart, 2009; Drake et al., 2010; Jackson et al., 2016; Ju & Hayes, 2008; McKenna, Bames-Holmes, Bames-Holmes, & Stewart, 2007; Murphy, MacCarthaigh, & Bames-Holmes, 2014; Rafacz et al., 2019). In the present study, an MD IRAP provided an account of the listener's history with respect to various verbal stimuli that potentially have acquired a cooperative or conformity function, however similar the response may topographically appear.\nModified (MD) IRAP\nThe MD IRAP is the product of an ongoing translational research program that builds on Smith (2013), and subsequent collaboration between the Performance System Technologies Laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the University of Nevada, Reno Medical School. The MD IRAP incorporates variations of the standard IRAP (Bames-Holmes et al., 2008) and the mixed-trial IRAP (Levin, Hayes, & Waltz, 2010) in an attempt to remediate some of the methodological issues presented by the standard and mixed-trial IRAP. This variation of IRAP still relies on the block-byblock hypothesis introduced by the traditional IRAP but addresses the limitations of the block design by isolating stimulus relations in a randomly presented order. Such a design permits investigative flexibility when it comes to designing stimuli. Specific trials are presented more than once within a given block, but the practice phase blocks of the modified version use a different set of practice target stimuli, along with the same two categorical/evaluative stimuli, such that the repeated practice exposures to test stimuli from the traditional version are eliminated within the current version. In addition, what distinguishes the MD IRAP from the standard and mixed-trial IRAP, is the way by which the MD IRAP accounts for responses that do not meet either accuracy (incorrect) or latency criteria. Rather than simply recording responses that are either incorrect or too slow and including them in the final data set of latencies for analysis, the program recognizes a response that does not meet one or both of the criteria and then quasi-randomly re-presents that specific trial later in the same block. The process is repeated as necessary during each block, such that the final data set for analysis includes only responses that are specific to the targeted relation (i.e., correct responses) and are emitted under sufficient time pressure to drive the implicit responding effect. Similar to list-level analyses, raw response latencies are transformed into D-IRAP scores, but the transformation follows a slightly different procedure. The D-IRAP scores for each target stimulus are calculated using the response latencies for that specific target stimulus and each of the evaluative/categorical stimuli (i.e., \"Comfortable\" and \"Uncomfortable\") across all test blocks of trials. For example, each relation is presented three times: \"Comfortable and Team Player\"--Yes/Agree; \"Comfortable and Team Player\"--No/Disagree. The mean latency is calculated for Yes and No responses, respectively. The standard deviation is then calculated from those trials combined (agree and disagree responses), and the difference between the two means is divided by that standard deviation. Thus, the same equation is applied, but instead of taking block means, stimulus means are used for each response type.\nThe MD IRAP provided the assessment of participant's individual responding when presented with the four cooperative and four conformity stimuli identified in the IRAP stimuli survey (see Table 1). Presented on the computer screen with the target stimuli was one evaluative word (\"comfortable\" or \"uncomfortable\") and two accuracy words (\"yes\" and \"no\") wherein participants responded using a keyboard key press to make their accuracy response (see Appendix for an example). Instructions were provided for the participants at the beginning of each trial block, which indicated the relationship with which they were to respond (e.g., comfortable or uncomfortable) to a particular set of stimuli (e.g., cooperative stimuli).\nFor example, the target stimulus \"team player\" and the attribution stimulus \"comfortable\" were presented in a trial block with instructions to respond comfortably to cooperative stimuli. If a participant emitted the response \"yes\" quickly, it suggested a stronger relationship with that particular target stimulus. A response of \"no\" would have been considered an inaccurate response. The MD IRAP began with two practice blocks to familiarize the participants following by six testing blocks, alternating between three consistent and three inconsistent blocks. This resulted in four different IRAP trial types and provided the researcher with information relevant to responding for each. Participants had to pass the two practice blocks and test blocks by responding under 3 s and with at least 80% accuracy. An IRAP effect in the testing blocks was determined by subtracting the mean response latency for the hypothesized consistent blocks from the mean response latency for the inconsistent blocks. This difference is said to reflect the \"differences in the probabilities of the two patterns of responding, as established in the preexperimental history of the individual\" (Bames-Holmes, Bames-Holmes, Luciano, & McEnteggart, 2017, p. 437).\nParticipants who responded with shorter latencies in IRAP test blocks that presented a consistent relation (e.g., cooperation/comfortable) as compared to an inconsistent relation (e.g., cooperation/uncomfortable) were assumed to have a stronger history of reinforcement with that stimulus-stimulus relation. In other words, it was expected that words with shorter latencies and more consistent patterns of responding would have an additive effect when presented in other contexts (Hughes & Bames-Holmes, 2013). The successful completion of both practice and test blocks of the MD IRAP was required to move on to Phase 2. Participants were allowed two attempts to successfully complete the MD IRAP.\nPhase 2: Data Entry Task\nParticipants were given a short break (5 m) after the completion of the MD IRAP in order for the researcher to analyze each participant's D-IRAP scores and subsequently embed them into the Phase 2 motivational statements, and then were brought back to complete the second phase of the experiment, the analog medical data entry task. A flowchart of the experimental procedure can be seen in Figure 1.\nExperimental Design and Independent Variables\nTo examine the differential, functional outcomes of verbal stimuli functioning as motivative augmentals, customized statements based on each participant's MD IRAP results were systematically introduced in a simulated EKG medical data entry task (see Appendix for a screenshot of data entry task). Using each participant's two strongest and positive stimuli from each list, cooperative and conformity motivational statements were presented during the task to see if the stimuli with the highest relative strength in the MD IRAP influenced a participant's likelihood to cooperatively respond. Cooperate or conform in this instance was selecting the button \"fix partner errors\" as opposed to working independently and selecting the button \"work alone\" in the presence of a conflicting financial contingency.\nPhase 2 was an alternating treatment design that included eleven 3 m conditions ([ABACD.sup.1][CE.sup.1][CD.sup.2][CE.sup.2]). Each participant encountered the same experimental conditions; however, within each condition, participants were exposed to the stimuli specific to their MD IRAP results (in the D and E conditions). In other words, researchers calculated the participant's four highest D-IRAP scores (two for cooperation, two for conformity) to embed into that participant's EKG data entry task in the D and E conditions.\nDuring the first three conditions (ABA), all participants were exposed to the EKG data entry task in the absence of motivational or neutral statements. Condition A was a piecerate contingency and Condition B was a pay-for-time contingency. The purpose of the first three conditions was to not only assess a rate of responding in the absence of statements, but also for participants to come under stimulus control of the two financial contingencies. See experimental procedure for details on financial contingencies.\nDuring the latter eight conditions, [CD.sup.1][CE.sup.1][CD.sup.2][CE.sup.2], the financial contingency from the previous condition (A, piece rate) was held constant and the presentation of statements were introduced. Neutral statements were presented first and alternated between motivational statement conditions in order to assess for any change in condition effects from the ABA conditions, carry over effects from previous motivational statement conditions, and to examine the additive effects of the motivational statements on cooperative and conformity responding, when compared to the presentation of neutral statements. Condition C represented the alternating neutral statements, \"Paying attention is highly valued\" and \"Staying on task is highly valued.\" Condition D1 represented a participant's strongest cooperative motivational statement (e.g., \"cooperation is highly valued\"), Condition E1 a participant's strongest conformity motivational statement (e.g., \"Fitting in is highly valued\"), Condition [D.sup.2] a participant's second strongest cooperative motivational statement (e.g., \"collaboration is highly valued\") and Condition [E.sup.2] a participant's second strongest conformity motivational statement (e.g., \"compliance is highly valued\"). In the [CD.sup.1][CE.sup.1][CD.sup.2][CE.sup.2] conditions the neutral and motivational statement scrolled at the bottom of the screen for the entirety of the 3-m condition, regardless of what button was selected. At the end of each condition a feedback screen appeared that provided the participants a report of how many screens they processed fixing partner errors, working alone, and how much money they made in that condition. This manipulation was conducted to determine the effects of cooperative and conformity responding in the face of a competing financial contingency to work alone and earn more money.\nIndependent variables included the manipulation of financial contingencies in the ABA conditions (piece rate and pay for time) and the neutral and motivational statements during intervention conditions, [CD.sup.1][CE.sup.1][CD.sup.2][CE.sup.2].\nDependent Variables\nDependent variables included the response allocation of the cooperative or conformity option (fixing partner errors) and the individual response option (working alone) across each condition, and measures of productivity across each condition (number of correct and incorrect EKG data screens processed). Motivative augmentals are concerned with the temporary alteration of a consequence functioning as a reinforcer. The temporary effect of the predicted motivative augmental (i.e., motivational statements) must then show that a choice was made immediately following its presentation in order to be considered a motivative augmental. Therefore, looking at choice order within each 3-m condition was analyzed.\nFor Phase 2 a secondary dependent measure of eye tracking for the first 29 participants was used to correlate the frequency and duration of a person's eye gaze directed at a particular stimulus on the computer screen within their EKG data entry task. Tobii Studio[R] is a technology that detects gaze on a screen based on the biological functioning of the eye (Tobii Technology, 2010). Two of the metrics produced by the Tobii Studio[R] software that controls the eye tracker device used in this study were fixation duration (i.e., the time in seconds of each fixation on a particular area of the screen) and fixation frequency (i.e., the number of times a participant looks at a particular area of the screen). The researchers defined specific areas on the screen (areas of interest; AOI), and the Tobii Studio[R] software calculated the total eye fixation duration and frequency included in those areas. The AOIs identified on the computer screen were the \"fix partner error\" button, \"work alone\" button, and the scrolling motivational or neutral statement. The AOIs and the size of the AOIs for all participants were the same (see Appendix for a screenshot of EKG data entry task including AOIs). Duration and frequency were selected as measures of eye gaze as they directly correlate to the primary dependent variables of choice count of working alone and fixing partner errors. Eye tracking offered an additional secondary measure to choice count measures (e.g., frequency of \"work alone\" and \"fix partner errors\") and postexperiment questionnaire data related to attending and behaving with respect to the motivational statements on the screen. Research in the communications field suggests that eye-tracking technology is an objective measurement of attention and a means to measure message \"retention\" (Crosswell & Porter, 2016; Crosswell, Porter, & Sanders, 2017; Maughan, Gutnikov, & Stevens, 2007; Siefert et al., 2008). In addition, eye-tracking technology has been used in advertising research to evaluate \"advertising effectiveness by revealing insight into the perceptual and cognitive processes that influence consumer decisions\" (Crosswell, 2013, p. 39). With the addition of eye-tracking data to this particular line of research, and behavior analytic research in general, a correlational and interactional relationship can be made between physiological findings (e.g., eye gaze) and observable behavior (e.g., choice count). In addition, a postexperiment questionnaire was administered.\nPhase 2: Experimental Procedure\nThe experimenters first read a script to participants detailing how to perform the EKG data entry task. In the instructions, participants were told that they were working with a partner to review and compare patient heart rates and rhythms against normal ranges and that they would receive whatever money they earned within the task. One 2-m practice trial with no financial contingency or statements was required to ensure participants understood how to complete the task. The experimenter remained in the room during the practice trial to answer any questions related to the EKG data entry task. Once the practice trial was complete, the eye-tracking equipment was activated for the first 29 participants. To do this, participants had to follow a red dot on the computer screen for approximately 10 s in order for the equipment to calibrate to the person's line of sight. No explanation was given to participants with respect to the eye-tracking software and no participant asked for any explanation. Following calibration, the experimenter left the room and the participant began the experimental phase of the EKG data entry task.\nThe EKG data entry task was an analog data entry task designed to simulate a medical record-processing task. The task involved the participant choosing between radio button options that categorized a patient's heart rate and QT interval (heart rhythm). New, fictitious patient information including the patient's name, date of birth, age, gender, patient ID number, heart-rate measurement, and QT interval appeared for each data screen processed. Based on this information, the participant had to identify the patient's heart rate and QT interval as being above, below or within a specified range by selecting two buttons, one for heart rate and one for QT interval. For example, a patient's listed heart rate and age was compared to a normal heart rate for a specified age range and participants had to select the correct option as being above, within, or below the specified range. Participants had to make two responses (heart rate and QT interval) for each trial and then click a \"submit\" button to complete the trial (see Appendix for a screenshot of data entry task).\nPrior to the beginning of each trial, participants had to select a button marked \"start work session\" which began that 3-m condition. Following the initial selection to \"start work session,\" two additional buttons marked \"work alone\" and \"fix partner errors\" appeared indicating whether the person was going to behave individually or cooperatively, respectively. After an option was selected, fictitious patient information then appeared and participants were required to fill in the necessary medical entry information. If \"work alone\" was selected, participants completed the medical task \"from scratch\" (i.e., the response options were blank). If \"fix partner errors\" was selected, a medical entry screen appeared with patient information completed but that had errors to be corrected (i.e., both response options were already filled in and either one or both were incorrect). After all fields had been completed or corrected, the participant clicked the submit button and the \"work alone\" and \"fix partner errors\" buttons reappeared. On the screen at all times was a timer counting down from 180 s so that participants were aware of how much time was left within that condition. In addition, a money-earned text box was always present on the screen indicating the amount earned in that condition.\nParticipants received feedback after each submission with a large red \"X\" if the submission was incorrect. Submitting records correctly in the piece-rate conditions resulted in $.02 for every data entry screen completed but only when choosing the \"work alone\" button. Data entry tasks that were submitted within the piece-rate condition that were \"fixing partner errors\" did not result in any financial consequence. Therefore, the only way to earn money in a piece-rate condition was to select the \"work alone\" button. Pay-for-time was a neutral financial contingency that paid a flat $.13 at the end of the 3-m condition regardless of how many data entry screens were completed, either \"work alone\" or \"fix partner errors.\" Throughout all conditions, a text box showing the amount earned within that condition was always visible. When in a piece-rate condition and a \"work alone\" screen was processed correctly, the $.02 earned immediately updated the cumulative amount earned box and briefly highlighted the box yellow. After each condition, a feedback screen replaced the data entry screen. The feedback screen informed participants how many total screens were submitted correctly, how much money they earned in that condition, how many screens were processed \"working alone\" and how many screens were processed \"fixing partner errors.\"\nTo ensure participants attended to the statements in the [CD.sup.1][CE.sup.1][CD.sup.2][CE.sup.2] conditions, at the start of each new condition, a message box with the motivational statement would appear (e.g., \"cooperation is highly valued\") that the participant would have to click out of in order to begin that new session. After the message box was removed, that same motivational statement immediately began to scroll across the bottom of the screen until the participant made the choice to either \"work alone\" or \"fix partner errors.\" Once a participant made a selection, the statement was removed, and patient information appeared. The same motivational statement would reappear in a given 3-m condition once a screen was submitted and the participant was again asked to select the option to either work alone or fix partner errors. In the D and E conditions, the motivational statements were intended to increase cooperative or conformity responding (i.e., selecting the \"fix partner errors\" button) despite no compensation for doing so (i.e., piece rate financial contingency for working alone only). All possible motivational statements based on individual D-IRAP scores and the neutral statements are shown in Table 2.\nPostexperiment Questionnaire\nFollowing the Phase 2 EKG data entry task, participants completed a posttest questionnaire and were paid the money they earned in Phase 2. The posttest questionnaire asked participants whether the motivational statements effected their cooperative or conformity responding, what task was easier to complete (work alone or fix partner errors), and if not getting paid to fix partner errors had any effect on their cooperative and conformity responding. In addition, participants were asked if they believed their partner was real and if the presence of a partner had an effect on their responding (i.e., was there a self-generated or derived social contingency) and the overall satisfaction with the study. Lastly, participants were asked if they had previously heard about the study.\nBames-Holmes, D., Hayden, E., Bames-Holmes, Y., & Stewart, I. (2008).

        "results": "Results\nPhase 1: IRAP\nResponse latencies of the MD IRAP were calculated using the standard D-algorithm, which produces a D-IRAP score that is similar to Cohen's d effect size (Bames-Holmes et al., 2010a, b; Cohen, 1988). Individual D-IRAP scores were provided for all eight stimuli presented within the MD IRAP. D-IRAP scores were organized in terms of effect size using the Rafacz et al. (2019) classification system. A strong effect (< -.8 and >.8), medium effect (-.5 to -.8 or .5 to .8), small effect (-.21 to -.49 or .21 to .49) and neutral or no effect (-.2 to .2). The D-IRAP score indicates both the strength and direction (positive or negative) of the relational response to the stimulus. The two strongest positive stimuli from both the cooperative and conformity lists were identified for each participant and used in Phase 2 of the study for that particular participant.\nTable 3 shows the breakdown of each stimulus for the cooperative and conformity lists and the number of participants who exhibited a strong, medium, weak, and neutral effect. Based on Rafacz et al. (2019) and Smith (2013) classification system of the strength of D-IRAP scores, a participant was considered to have a moderate to strong history with a particular stimulus if their D-IRAP score was .5 or higher. Having two classes of stimuli (cooperation and conformity) in the MD IRAP allowed for a posthoc classification system of participants and a between group comparison based on the strength of D-IRAP scores for each list, cooperation and conformity (see Table 1 for list). For example, if a participant had a D-IRAP score of >.5 for their top two stimuli from either the cooperative or conformity list (i.e., their top two cooperative stimuli were both >.5) they were identified as \"pro-cooperative.\" Based on the identification of a D-IRAP score of greater than .5 indicating a strong to moderate relationship with a particular stimulus (Smith, 2013), we were able to identify four post-hoc groups: \"cooperative\" (i.e., their top two cooperative stimuli were >.5), \"conformity\" (i.e., their top two conformity stimuli were >.5), \"both\" (i.e., their top two cooperative and conformity stimuli were >.5) and \"neither\" (i.e., one or more stimuli from each group was <.5). This classification system allowed for a post-hoc analysis of between group responding after each participant had gone through Phase 2. See Table 4 for the average D-IRAP scores for each group.\nPhase 2: Data Entry Task\nThis study primarily examined the differential effects of varying stimuli (individually identified in the MD IRAP) on cooperative and conformity responding functioning as potential motivational stimuli, or motivative augmentals. In order to discuss these statements functioning as motivative augmentals, the order of choice allocation within each condition was analyzed. This study also assessed the potential delineation between the terms cooperation and conformity as predicted by the MD IRAP and demonstrated in the EKG data entry task. Identifying participants based on their IRAP scores as being part of a particular group: \"cooperative,\" \"conformity,\" \"both,\" and \"neither\" allowed for a between group analysis and a discussion related to the differential responding between each group and the relation to the definitions of cooperation and conformity that were provided. Lastly, the secondary measure of eye tracking and its correlation to participant choice behavior was analyzed.\nEffect of Statements on Cooperative/Conformity Responding\nThe effects of the statements on cooperative and conformity responding (choosing to fix partner errors; FPE) were determined through a visual depiction and statistical analysis at the individual level for each participant and also determined through statistical analysis at the group level. Fifty-one of the 67 participants (76%) increased cooperative or conformity responding with respect to experimental conditions that included a motivational statement (conditions D and E). The statements can be argued to have functioned as motivative augmentals for the majority of participants as the data demonstrated the reinforcing function of cooperating or conforming, as selecting the fix partner errors button temporarily increased in the presence of the statements at a descriptive level (see Figure 2). Or, as Hayes (1989) puts it, \"the statement of the rule might establish certain stimuli as more effective behavioral consequences; that is, the statement of the rule might make those stimuli more rewarding or more aversive\" (p. 291). In order to further substantiate that these stimuli temporarily altered the reinforcing function of selecting to fix partner errors, and thus functioned as motivative augmentals, a statistical analysis of variance was run to power. Results of a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures indicated there was a statistically significant difference in choosing to fix partner errors (i.e., cooperative or conformity responding) between conditions with a motivational statement and conditions with a neutral statement F (7, 462) = 23.23, p = <.00001, [n.sup.2] = .26. Based on the descriptive and statistical analyses, the verbal statements functioned as establishing operations that temporarily increased the reinforcing function of fixing partner errors as they participated in a relational frame of equivalence with the existing categories of reinforcing stimuli, cooperation or conformity, as identified in the MD IRAP.\nTemporary Alteration of Choice Behavior\nAdding to the argument that the motivational statements functioned as motivative augmentals, an analysis of the temporary alteration of the reinforcing effects to choose to fix partner errors in the presence of motivational statements was necessary. Previous research (Candido, 2013) discussed the momentary, or temporary, function of motivative augmentals, in particular in conditions that included a competing directacting contingency. Measuring the order of choice allocation across each 3-m condition captured the momentary transformation of stimulus function to choose to fix partner errors as the more reinforcing alternative in the presence of motivational statements (see Figure 3.)\nOn average, a total of 18.3 screens were processed in each 3-m condition, whether that was a selection to fix partner errors or work alone. When presented with a motivational statement to cooperate or conform at the start of each condition, participants initially--or temporarily--chose to fix partner errors as their reinforcement history predicted, rather than choose the direct acting financial contingency to work independently and make money. Visual depiction of the data (Figure 3) suggests the majority of participants chose to fix partner errors within their first three choices in each condition with a motivational statement more so than in conditions with either no statement or conditions with a neutral statement. In addition, a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures on fixing partner errors demonstrated there was a statistically significant difference in fixing partner errors (i.e., cooperative or conformity responding) within the first three responses between conditions with a motivational statement as compared to conditions with a neutral statement F(7, 441) = 21.21, p <.00001, [n.sup.2] = .25. When comparing the percentage of participants who chose to fix partner errors within their first three choices in each condition with a motivational statement (see Figure 3) to the overall percentage of choosing to fix partner errors for the entirety of each 3-m condition (see Figure 2), participants had higher percentages of fixing partner errors within the first three choices as compared to the entirety of the condition wherein the independent response (work alone) dominated. By comparing the average percent of cooperative or conformity responding across each 3-m condition with a motivational statement to the average percent of cooperative or conformity responding within the first three choices, the percentage of responses to fix partner errors declined, which pointed to the temporary alteration of responding.\nBetween Group Comparison\nA visual depiction of the data broken out by group across experimental conditions showed there was a differentiation between groups with respect to experimental conditions with a motivational statement and cooperative or conformity responding. The \"both\" and \"cooperative\" groups on average fixed partner errors in experimental conditions with a motivational statement more so than both the \"conformity\" group and the \"neither\" group. In addition, the average of fixing partner errors in all four motivational statement conditions between groups differed (see Table 5). Based on the difference across groups, as well as our overall visual analysis (see Figure 4), posthoc paired-samples t-tests were conducted to confirm conclusions from the visual analysis. Results showed that the \"both\" group (M= .46, SD = .36) fixed partner errors significantly more than the \"neither\" group (M = .24, SD = .33), t = 3.36,p < .001, d = .64 and the \"conformity\" group (M= .26, SD = .31), t = 2.91, p < .01, d = .59. Additional paired-sampled /-tests showed that the \"cooperative\" group (M = .4, SD = .34) also fixed partner errors significantly more than the \"neither\" group (M- .24, SD = .33), t = -2.94,p < .01, d= .48 and the \"conformity\" group (M = .26, SD = .31), t = 2.34,p < .05, d = .43. Based on this analysis, the \"both\" and \"cooperative\" groups fixed partner errors in experimental conditions with motivational statements statistically higher than both the \"conformity\" and \"neither\" group. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences when comparing the \"conformity\" group to the \"neither\" group or comparing the \"both\" group to the \"cooperative\" group.\nAlthough there was no statistical difference in responding between the \"both\" group and the \"cooperative\" group when comparing the average of cooperative or conformity responding across all four conditions with a motivational statement, a visual analysis of the data showed a maintenance of responding with respect to fixing partner errors with the \"both\" group that was absent in all other groups (see Figure 5). When comparing the first motivational statement condition ([D.sup.1]) and the last motivational statement condition ([E.sup.2]), results showed a decline in selecting to fix partner errors (cooperative or conformity responding) in the \"cooperative,\" \"conformity,\" and \"neither\" group in subsequent conditions. Post-hoc paired t-tests confirmed the \"cooperative\" group fixed partner errors significantly more in the first condition with a motivational statement (M = .63, SD = .31) than compared to the fourth motivational statement (M= .26, SD = .32), t = 3.61, p < .001, d = 1.17, the \"conformity\" group fixed partner errors significantly more in the first condition with a motivational statement (M = .47, SD = .35) compared to the fourth motivational statement (M= . 16, SD = .27), t= 2.91, p; < .01, d = .99, and the \"neither\" group fixed partner errors significantly more in the first condition with a motivational statement (M = .4, SD = .38) compared to the fourth motivational statement (M= .19, SD = .29), t = 2.02,p < .05, d = .6. The \"both\" group, however, had no change in responding at a statistically significant level when comparing rates of cooperative or conformity responding (fixing partner errors) across conditions, showing a maintenance of cooperative or conformity responding in the presence of motivational statements and a financially competing contingency to work alone.\nEye-Tracking Analysis\nEye tracking was used as a secondary measure to determine if correlations existed between eye fixation count of our three AOIs (\"fix partner errors\" button, \"work alone\" button, and the scrolling message) and choice allocation (see Appendix for AOIs). In addition, correlations between the AOIs were analyzed for 18 of the participants so that their accuracy of recording with respect to eye gaze calibration was at a level that captured the AOIs consistently across each condition.\nFindings showed strong correlations for both the relationship between the eye fixation count of the fix partner errors button and fix partner errors choice, and also the correlation between eye fixation count of the work alone button and work alone choice (see Figure 6). Results of the Pearson correlation indicated that there was a significant positive association between the eye fixation count of the fix partner errors button and fix partner errors choice (r(17) =.633,p < .01) and a strong positive association between eye fixation count of the work alone button and work alone choice (r(17) = .69, p < .001). Said another way, there is a correlation between participants looking at a particular button and a participant selecting that button.\nAs mentioned, another correlation of interest was the association between the eye fixation of the scrolling message (the AOI that contained the neutral and motivational statements) and eye fixation of either the fix partner errors button or work alone button. Results of the Pearson correlation indicated there was a significant positive association between the eye fixation count of the scrolling message and the eye fixation count of the fix partner errors button (r(17) =.81, p < .0001). In other words, a relationship existed between participants looking at the scrolling message when it contained a cooperative or conformity motivational statement and looking at the fix partner errors button. When looking at the correlation between the scrolling message and work alone responding, results of the Pearson correlation indicated a significant negative association between eye fixation count of the scrolling message and work alone choice (r(17) = -.15,p< .001). Thus, a relationship existed between participants increasing independent responding (selecting the work alone button) and decreasing eye fixation on the scrolling message area of interest. These two findings strengthen the argument that when participants are fixating on the scrolling messages, they are coming under control of the motivational statements with respect to choosing to fix partner errors (i.e., cooperate or conform) or attending to the fix partner errors button. This positive correlation between looking at the scrolling message AOI and looking at the fix partner errors button, but not selecting it, also strengthens the argument that the motivational statements only temporarily, or initially, increased the reinforcing value of selecting the button to fix partner errors. Although participants saw the motivational statement to cooperate or conform and then attended to the fix partner errors button, they were ultimately not selecting to fix partner errors consistently across a 3-m condition.\nPostexperiment Questionnaire\nWhen asked, 85% of participants (n = 56) reported they primarily worked alone rather than fixed partner errors. Of those 56 participants, 56% (n = 29) said they did so as it was the \"easier\" choice and 37% (n = 19) said they did so because they got paid. However, when participants were asked explicitly what task was harder, working alone or fixing partner errors, responding was split fairly even, 35% (n = 23) reported working alone was more difficult, 38% (n = 25) reported fixing partner errors was more difficult and 27% (n = 18) reported no difference in difficulty. When asked if not getting paid to fix partner errors atfected their cooperative or conformity behavior, 50% of participants (n = 33) reported it decreased then-cooperative behavior. This would suggest the consequence of working alone (i.e., financial contingency to make money), rather than the task itself (i.e., easier to work alone) motivated participants to select to work alone more frequently. Further, when asked if they were motivated by money, 81 % (n = 55) of participants reported they were at least somewhat to highly motivated to earn money. All 67 participants indicated they noticed the motivational statements in the EKG data entry task and 45% (n = 31) reported that the motivational statements increased their cooperative or conformity responding. Lastly, when asked explicitly if the motivational statements increased cooperative or conformity responding, 59% (n = 39) said that it increased their level of fixing partner errors. This selfreporting is lower than the 76% (n = 51) identified in the data that differentially responded to the motivational statements (see EKG data entry results discussion). This could be that participants reported that the statements initially set the occasion to fix partner errors, but the financial contingency to work alone eventually dominated responding.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThis extended research examining varying financial contingencies, and level of customization of motivational statements (rules) on cooperative and conformity responding. Previous research looking at various financial contingencies and cooperative responding showed that most participants do not alter cooperative responding in financially competing contingencies even when presented with motivational statements to cooperatively respond (Candido, 2013; Maglieri, 2007; Rafacz et al., 2019). Rather, participants will only cooperate under financially neutral contingencies (i.e., pay for time or profit share). However, in this study, the stimuli used in the motivational statements in the EKG data entry task were taken from each participant's MD IRAP results and were individualized. This is a level of customization that was missing from previous studies that instead aggregated IRAP results at the group level and embedded those stimuli into the EKG data entry task (Candido, 2013; Maglieri, 2007; Rafacz et al., 2019). Therefore, it was predicted based on these previous studies, that individually determined motivational statements would yield the most cooperative or conformity responding. In individualizing the motivational statements, we found that the majority (76%) of participants responded to the motivational statements by choosing to fix partner errors at a level that was higher than the ABA conditions and the neutral statement conditions, at least initially, in each condition with a motivational statement.\nAlso consistent with previous research was the impact on cooperative and conformity responding when presented with a financially competing contingency. Research has shown that participants will primarily respond in accordance with whatever direct financial contingency is in place (Candido, 2013; Maglieri, 2007; Rafacz et al., 2019). In this study, when participants were under a piece-rate financial contingency to promote individual responding, cooperative and conformity responding was temporary and individual responding dominated. Previous research (Candido, 2013; Rafacz et al., 2019) also looked at varying a financially neutral contingency (i.e., payment is the same for either choice) and a competing piece rate contingency to see the differences in responding with respect to motivational statements. As mentioned, participants chose to fix partner errors more frequently when in conditions with financially neutral contingencies rather than competing financial contingencies. This study only examined conditions with financially competing contingencies and found that, like previous research, the motivational statements only temporarily altered cooperative and conformity responding, rather than replacing the contingency-shaped responding (Candido, 2013; Maglieri, 2007; Rafacz et al., 2019). When crafting messaging for any audience, therefore, it is predicted that the rule (i.e., antecedent stimulus) and the direct-acting contingency should align in order to promote and maintain a specific behavior. This study was designed as an analog to highlight the effect of motivational statements on cooperative or conformity responding even in the face of losing money to do so. As with any analog study taking place in a laboratory, there are limitations to directly generalizing results to what would occur in a field environment. Of course, field locations have many variables that cannot be controlled, and the setting or organization may not allow the time for phase changes. Productivity cannot be compromised, and employee participation may not be optimal for research in an actual work setting. The lack of controls for a study in a field environment necessitates the need for an analog study. By neutralizing the effect of some of the controlling variables in the work environment and running the study in the laboratory, the researchers were able to determine the effect of some fewer number but isolated dependent variables. What the researchers compromised was the extent to which the work setting is successfully duplicated to accurately collect generalizable work-setting data. Whether or not this analog study correlated directly to an organization's naturalistic working environment, some empirical information can be indicated with this approach and offers incremental improvements in terms of demonstrating the motivational influence of communication (organizational rules as well as the source of rule generation) on cooperative responding. The information attained may be useful for future research in this field.\nExperimental research looking into motivative augmentals is extremely limited (Kissi et al., 2017). In order to approach an experimental and functional account, future work could attempt to establish motivative augmentals using arbitrary words for the purpose of \"developing a functional-analytic precision of rule-following based on a laboratory induced network of derived relations\" (Kissi et al., 2017, p. 15). The limited research available could be due to the fact that motivative augmentals are said to augment the other classes of rule-governed behavior, pliance and tracking (Hayes, 1989). Plys and tracks are subject to alteration based on augmentals as they alter the reinforcing consequences of either plys or tracks by \"creating a need\" (Hayes, 1989, p. 208). This study was an attempt at an experimental analysis of motivative augmentals \"creating that need\" with respect to cooperative or conformity responding.\nUnderstanding the conditions under which a person will engage in cooperative or conformity behavior even in the presence of a competing contingency and crafting messaging to function as motivative augmentals has implications at the organizational and cultural level. Based on previous studies (Maglieri, 2007; Rafacz et al., 2019), the alteration of responding is temporary in the face of a financially competing contingency. Therefore, we should predict that crafting communication to promote a particular behavior under similar financial circumstances will to not maintain that particular behavior over time. However, with this study, we identified a group (\"both\" group) wherein responding was likely to be sustained at higher levels even with a financially competing contingency. This maintenance of responding could be that participants that relationally responded at statistically significant levels to both cooperative and conformity stimuli based on the MDIRAP results have a history of helping others with respect to some shared outcome (i.e., helping to fix a partners errors as they would do for you, cooperative/reciprocal responding) and a history of socially mediated rule following (conformity responding). Similar to Tomeke et al.'s (2008) discussion on the problems with generalized tracking, being a \"cooperative\" person is based on a personal history of derived relations among events which transforms the function of ineffective rules. This leads a participant to being inflexible to the actual short-term consequence of cooperative responding (losing money) and rigid rule following with respect to behaving as they \"ought to\" based on listener-generated rules and the socially mediated consequences related to being cooperative. In other words, those that fell within this group were insensitive to the direct financial contingency and engaged in generalized pliance where the consequence of choosing to \"fix partner errors\" was controlled by some abstract, verbally constructed consequence. In either case, maintenance of responding across conditions with the \"both\" group may not have been appropriately contextually controlled as those that fall within this group were responding to delayed and arbitrarily derived social contingencies that dominated immediate consequences. Assessment tools like the MD IRAP may help organizations and those in leadership positions to identify those employees, citizens, etc. who have a history of reinforcement with respect to an arbitrary relation between the social consequence of following rules (conforming) and being a cooperative person as their behavior is more likely to be maintained (O'Conner et al., 2019; Tomeke et al., 2008). And by augmenting this particular repertoire, an individual, \"may pursue more and more remote and probabilistic consequences which will alter the reinforcing and punishing properties of present contingencies\" (Tomeke et al., 2008, p. 155).\nFuture research could look at the other classes of rulegoverned behavior (plys and tracks) and the impact motivative augmentals have on rules by analyzing particular patterns of responding, like this study found across specific groups. As discussed above, the \"both\" group maintained their cooperative and conformity responding when presented with a motivational statement (rule) more so than the other identified groups. Based on generalized tracking (Tomeke et al, 2008) and our definition of conformity and the social consequences of rule following, a participant maintains conformity and cooperative responding when presented with a motivational statement (rule) as there is correspondence between the current rule (e.g., cooperation is highly valued) and other rules in the listener's history (e.g., \"I am a cooperative person\"). In the case of the \"cooperative\" group, data demonstrated more flexible mle following across conditions. When initially presented with a motivational statement to cooperate in condition D1, the \"cooperative\" group fixed partner errors at a rate that was higher than all other groups but then quickly decelerated in subsequent conditions (see Figure 5). Based on these patterns of responding, the motivational statements can be argued to have augmented pliance influenced by socially mediated factors (e.g., doing what someone tells you to do, in this case to be cooperative and fix partner errors). However, once participants came into contact with the direct consequences of a cooperative or conformity response (i.e., fixing partner errors and not making money), responding switched over to working alone and making money. This is an example of rule-governed behavior appropriately transferring from instances of socially mediated consequences (pliance) to the ones aligned with the way the world is arranged (see tracking, Hayes, 1989). Likewise, the \"neither\" group demonstrated a motivative augmental effect initially in conditions when presented with a motivational statement, although at much lower rates than any other group. In addition, responding switched over to working alone at higher rates (see Figures 3 and 4). The \"neither\" group shows more flexible rule following (transitioning from pliance to tracking) within each condition with a motivational statement that was similar to the \"cooperative\" group, but at lower rates of responding to fix partner errors with the initial presentation of a motivational statement (see Figure 5). This would be predicted as participants who were categorized as being part of the \"neither\" group had the lowest overall DIRAP scores for both the cooperative and conformity stimuli (see Table 4). Lastly, the \"conformity\" group, based on our definition of conformity, may have had lower levels of cooperative and conformity responding as any rules related to being part of a group and the socially mediated consequences of following a particular rule (pliance) may not have been in a frame of coordination of being \"cooperative.\" In addition, the group to which the person would conform was contrived. Correspondence between behavior and rules about what is \"right\" are based on a history of arbitrary socially mediated consequences that may have nothing to do with making a cooperative response.\nThe opportunity to measure eye fixation allowed us to do several analyses. The simplest, but still important, was to confirm that participants actually attended to the motivational statements. In addition, our correlational analyses between eye fixations on the motivational statements and eye fixations on choice buttons and choice behavior were significant. These findings further the argument that the motivational statements functioned as motivative augmentals as the data demonstrated the correlation between participant's looking at a particular motivational statement and attending to the \"fix partner errors\" button, regardless of the specific choice behavior. The eye-tracking correlation also helped to confirm the momentary influence of motivational statements on responding. Motivative augmentals temporarily alter the reinforcing consequences of a particular behavior. The correlation between participant's attending to the motivational statement (i.e., eye gaze frequency) and then immediately looking at the fix partner error button demonstrates what we may refer to as a brief and immediate relational response (BIRRs). However, the data suggested that although participants immediately attended to the motivational statement and then to the fix partner error button (i.e., BIRRs), participants ultimately altered their responding and chose to instead work alone. This alteration of responding may be referred to as an extended and elaborated relational response (EERRs; Bames-Holmes et al., 2010a, b).\nPrevious studies (Maglieri, 2007; Rafacz et ah, 2019) cited that peer introduction was a limitation. In this study, peers were not used, but implied in the EKG data entry script. In Rafacz et al. (2019), the majority of participants reported in the postexperiment questionnaire that they did not believe their partner was real. Based on this feedback, Candido (2013) introduced peers (confederates) as a variable to the experiment and found that the majority of participants still did not believe their partner was real. Our postexperiment questionnaire reflected the same limitation. Seventy-six percent of participants reported that they did not believe their partner was real. Given this and previous feedback, the EKG data entry task may be limited as it does not provide the necessary feedback in order for a participant to assume there is a partner present. The EKG data entry task also does not provide a commensurate consequence between the participant and the \"partner\" that is considered necessary for many definitions of cooperation (Guerin, 1994; Hake & Vukelich, 1972; Schmitt, 1984). Future extensions of this task may look to include feedback on the screen that shows your partner's performance and the reciprocal relationship between the performance of the participant and partner. In addition, the preexperiment survey (Table 1) was intended to identify the stimuli to be used in the MD IRAP that was most similar to \"working with others\" for the cooperation stimuli and \"conforming with others\" for the conformity stimuli. However, this study did not include the stimulus, \"conformity\" in the list of stimuli most similar to \"conforming with others.\" This may have had an effect on the rank order of the terms best suited for the phrase \"conforming with others\" as it is assumed the stimulus \"conformity\" would have ranked in the top four stimuli and therefore would have had an effect on those participants who would be identified as \"pro-conformity\" based on IRAP performance. Future studies could look to include the stimulus, \"conformity\" into the class of stimuli used for the conformity list and if this has an effect on the number of participants identified as part of the \"conformity\" group. Lastly, our between group analysis was not balanced. Based on our MD IRAP classification of data, we identified 9 \"both\" participants, 22 \"neither\" participants, 19 \"cooperative\" participants, and 17 \"conformity\" participants. This limited the statistical analyses that were implemented and did not permit for a mixed ANOVA analysis to be run to power.\nBased on the results of this study and the differential responding between the cooperative and conformity stimuli and the potential to differentiate IRAP groups, we may begin to make the case of the potential functional delineation between cooperation and conformity. Analyzing the existing literature and experimental research in the social psychological field of the two terms allows for a more rigorous behavior analytic understanding and distinction of the phenomena and their ability to function as motivative augmentals. As Kissi et al. (2017) say, \"it is likely that work in other areas of psychology (e.g., experiments on obedience to authority; see Blass, 1999, and Milgram, 1963) exists that may be of relevance to our understanding of the behaviors associated with pliance, tracking, and augmenting\" (p. 17). It is important as behavior scientists to understand the terms cooperation and conformity and the distinction between the two as it may have important implications in social settings and sociocultural phenomena. It is possible that we are not considering apparent direct social contingencies or a lack of a shared outcome, leading to an overgeneralization of the term cooperation. As behavior scientists work to better understand the conditions under which people are likely to conform and cooperate and the distinctions between the two, we are able to promote instances in which their application is for prosocial behaviors. Arranging the environment to encourage instances of conformity or cooperative behavior and the consequences of increasing such prosocial behaviors impacts us all when it is applied to any number of important areas like organizational settings, social justice movements, and political participation.\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\nConflict of Interest On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest.\nEthical Approval All procedures performed in this study involving human participants were in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments.\nInformed Consent Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in this study.\nData Availability The datasets during and/or analyzed during this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nAppendix\nCaption: Fig. 7 Modified TRAP screen\nCaption: Fig. 8 EKG data entry screens\nCaption: Fig. 9 EKG data entry screen with patient information\nCaption: Fig. 10 EKG data entry screen with AOIs highlighted\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/S40732-020-00400-7",

        "abstract": "I investigated the relationships among health consciousness, self-esteem, and successful aging in the context of South Korean baby boomers' engagement in leisure sports. The sample consisted of 530 baby boomers who actively participated in leisure sports in South Korea. Data collection was carried out through an online survey. Structural equation modeling revealed that health consciousness had a positive effect on both self-esteem and successful aging. Moreover, self-esteem had a positive effect on successful aging. My findings provide valuable insights to guide the formation of impactful strategies aimed at enriching the journey of successful aging within this specific demographic.\nKeywords baby boomer, leisure sports, health consciousness, self-esteem, successful aging\nArticle Highlights\n* Health consciousness was found to have a positive effect on self-esteem and successful aging among South Korean baby boomers engaging in leisure sports.\n* Self-esteem had a positive effect on successful aging.\n* This research contributes insights for formulating effective strategies for a successful aging experience.\nThe aging of populations presents distinct challenges at both personal and societal levels, manifesting in age-related diseases, physical and social inactivity, and subsequent impacts on individual quality of life (Banerjee, 2020). At the societal level, the increasing proportion of older adult citizens strains national finances due to a reduced working-age population and escalating healthcare costs (M. J. Kim & Kim, 2020; Restrepo & Rozental, 1994). In response to aging-related challenges, the concept of healthy aging has gained prominence. The World Health Organization (2021) defines healthy aging as \"developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being in older age\" (p. 9). This approach aims to enhance older individuals' overall quality of life through well-being and functional capacity. Similarly, the paradigm of successful aging has surfaced, shifting from traditional aging perspectives. Successful aging emphasizes disease prevention and health promotion, leveraging the potential inherent in older individuals, in contrast to the prior focus on negative factors such as loss or decline (Reichstadt et al., 2007; Rowe & Kahn, 1998; Ryff, 1982).\nSelf-esteem, which is an important factor in achieving successful aging (Bae, 2020), is defined as the extent to which someone perceives themself as a meaningful, capable, and successful individual (Coopersmith, 1981). In the case of Korean baby boomers, the higher their self-esteem, the higher are their scores on positive psychological variables such as life satisfaction, subjective happiness, and subjective quality of life (T. S. Kang, 2018; M. J. Lee, 2023; Seo, 2018).\nWell-being likewise acts as a determinant of successful aging. Rowe and Kahn (1997), who were foundational to the development of the concept of successful aging, identified \"low probability of disease and disease-related disability, high cognitive and physical functional capacity, and active engagement with life\" (p. 433) as key components. Baltes and Baltes (1990) stressed individual considerations and continuous interaction with the environment to minimize the negative effects and maximize the positive outcomes of aging, despite the inevitable physical or cognitive decline. Scholars have highlighted the profound connections between physical, psychological, and social well-being in achieving successful aging (e.g., Fisher & Specht, 1999).\nHealth consciousness, which is defined as \"the degree to which health concerns are integrated into a person's daily activities\" (Jayanti & Burns, 1998, p. 5), has a substantial influence on preventive healthcare behaviors that contribute to an individual's overall life span. Health-conscious individuals take an interest in preserving and enhancing their health in their daily lives (Hong, 2009), and strive to enhance their well-being by simultaneously adopting multiple health behaviors (Newsom et al., 2005).\nIn advanced welfare states, national policies have been implemented to create an environment that fosters health management through leisure sports participation, with the goal of achieving successful aging even before individuals reach old age (Noh & Kim, 2009). Leisure sports activities, which form a key policy initiative in South Korea, positively address fundamental human needs, including health, self-expression, self-realization, self-esteem, and physical activity (Cheng et al., 2017; Mannell, 2007).\nThe population of South Korea, as of 2023, includes approximately 9.5 million older adults (18.4%), making it one of the world's fastest aging nations (Statistics Korea, 2023). This trend largely stems from the baby boomer generation, born between 1955 and 1963, who numbered around 7.2 million as of 2020 (Statistics Korea, 2021). The initial wave, born in 1955, entered older adulthood in 2020, with an estimated 690,000 to 920,000 more projected to join this age group by 2028 (Song & Won, 2020). Distinguished by high levels of education, strong economic power, and high professional competence, South Korean baby boomers differ from earlier generations (E. Kim, 2021; J. H. Lee, 2019; Rha et al., 2008) and also show within-group differences in areas such as health, life expectancy, education, and retirement preparedness, which are influenced by individual factors (C. J. Park, 2014). Consequently, the degree of successful aging may vary among individuals.\nA systematic review revealed that older adults' definition of successful aging differs across countries and cultures (Reich et al., 2020). This implies the need to examine successful aging within the context of a particular country or culture, as is the case in this study, in which I focused on Northeast Asia by recruiting a sample of South Korean baby boomers. South Korea faces the challenge of becoming a super-aged society, necessitating preparation. While research examining the successful aging of baby boomers is pivotal for enhancing public health and welfare within an aged society (Foster & Walker, 2015), there exists a scarcity of studies focusing on successful aging among South Korean baby boomers.\nI investigated the structural relationships between health consciousness, self-esteem, and successful aging among baby boomers engaged in leisure sports. My aim was to contribute essential insights for formulating effective strategies to promote successful aging among baby boomers in South Korea. The research model is presented in Figure 1.\nResearch Hypotheses\nIn the later stages of life, various changes, including shifts in social interactions, may contribute to feelings of loneliness among older adults. However, proactive engagement in health behaviors, such as regular physical activity and exercise, may mitigate loneliness and promote self-esteem and psychological or social well-being (Y. S. Kim, 2001; Y. R. Kim, 2006; Ma, 2001). Given prior studies (Breslow & Enstrom, 1980; Hong, 2009) have shown that health consciousness can predict proactive health behavior, I established the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: Health consciousness among baby boomers participating in leisure sports will positively affect their self-esteem.\nWithin the realm of successful aging, health-related behaviors have been a focal point of research (Goo & Kang, 2015; Y. H. Lee, 2011). The significance of engaging in leisure-time physical activities or exercise for promoting successful aging has been further emphasized in numerous studies (e.g., Ahn & Shin, 2017; C. I. Lee & Park, 2020). Thus, I established the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2: Health consciousness among baby boomers participating in leisure sports will positively affect their successful aging.\nIn the context of successful aging, self-esteem emerges as a crucial psychological factor that profoundly influences overall quality of life and well-being among older adults (Choi et al., 2009; Chung, 2004; D. G Lee, 2013). Numerous researchers have suggested the positive impact of self-esteem on the attainment of successful aging among diverse groups of older adults (Bae, 2020; D. H. Kim, 2014; H. Y. Lee, 2016). Thus, I established the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 3: Self-esteem among baby boomers participating in leisure sports will positively affect their successful aging.",
        "introduction": "",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants and Procedure\nThe participants in this study were baby boomers in South Korea, born between 1955 and 1963, who participated in leisure sports. I conducted an online survey through Macromille Embrain in South Korea from September to November 2021. The survey was administered to individuals listed in the company's database after providing them with a comprehensive explanation of the research purpose and obtaining their consent for participation. Respondents initiated the survey by clicking on a hyperlink provided within the email invitation, then a screening question was presented: \"Have you previously engaged in leisure sports activities?\" To enhance response rates, the survey company offered a monetary incentive of USD 1.00 to all participants who successfully completed the survey.\nThere were 540 participants, of whom 10 were excluded because they had missing data or unreliable responses; thus, 530 valid questionnaires were analyzed. Among the respondents, 50% (n = 265) were men, 50% (n = 265) were women, and 51.3% (n = 272) were born between 1960 and 1963, with the rest (48.7%, n = 258) being born between 1955 and 1959.\nMeasures\nThe variables were measured using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.\nHealth Consciousness\nThe health-consciousness measure I used consisted of five items (e.g., \"I'm currently improving my mental and physical health by participating in leisure sports\") that were modified according to the purpose of the study (K. R. Kim, 2000; S. Y. Lee et al., 1995).\nSelf-Esteem\nThe 10-item self-esteem scale I used was developed by Rosenberg (1965) and adapted by Jeon (1974). It includes six items related to positive self-esteem (e.g., \"I feel I am as valuable as others\") and four items related to negative self-esteem (e.g., \"I tend to think of myself as a failure\"). Negative self-esteem items are reverse scored.\nSuccessful Aging\nThe 31-item successful aging scale used in this study was modified from the successful aging measure for Korean older adults developed by D. B. Kim (2008). Dimensions include autonomous life (six items; e.g., \"I try to break unhealthy habits\"), self-completion orientation (six items; e.g., \"I have a plan I want to achieve in life\"), positive life participation (five items; e.g., \"I tend to make friends easily\"), satisfaction with one's offspring (five items; e.g., \"I am proud of my children\"), self-acceptance (three items; e.g., \"I am satisfied with the house I live in\"), and other-acceptance (three items; e.g., \"I tend to accept younger generations' opinions\").\nThis study does bear some limitations. First, given that the participants were all baby boomers actively engaged in leisure sports, stratifying the sample into leisure sports participants and nonparticipants could unveil more nuanced outcomes, thereby further elucidating the intricate relationships among subvariables. Second, given that this study's methodology was centered around quantitative research involving survey data, it is recommended that qualitative approaches, such as interviews, be used in future research. Qualitative methods have the potential to capture multidimensional and detailed perspectives, thereby facilitating a more profound exploration of insights and outcomes.",
        "results": "Results\nCronbach's alphas, descriptive statistics, and correlation analysis results are shown in Table 1. Cronbach's alphas exceeded the minimum criterion of .70, indicating acceptable reliability. The correlation coefficients between the variables were less than .80, indicating that they were independent of each other and multicollinearity was not a significant concern. Prior to testing the hypotheses, I conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to confirm the validity and goodness of fit of the measures used in this study. The measurement model demonstrated an excellent fit to the data, chi square ([chi square]) = 2042.519, degrees of freedom (df) = 942, comparative fit index (CFI) = .91, Tucker--Lewis index (TLI) = .90, root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .05.\nUsing maximum likelihood estimation, I analyzed the structural model of participants' health consciousness, self-esteem, and successful aging. The model satisfied the criteria for acceptable goodness of fit, [chi square] = 243.46, df = 60, CFI = .95, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .07. I then tested the hypotheses through structural equation modeling. The results demonstrated that health consciousness was significantly and positively related to self-esteem (.32, p < .001) and successful aging (.19, p < .001). Further, self-esteem was significantly and positively related to successful aging (.86, p < .001). Thus, all of my hypotheses were supported.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe findings of this study underscore the significant role of health consciousness and self-esteem in the context of successful aging through participation in leisure sports among baby boomers. To begin with, there is a noteworthy positive influence of health consciousness on self-esteem. Although research examining the direct relationship between health consciousness and self-esteem is limited, previous studies have reported that higher levels of health consciousness tend to be associated with increased engagement in health-promotion behaviors (Ha & Choi, 2013). Drawing from the insights of previous studies on health-promotion behaviors, involvement in physical activity and exercise contributes positively to the enhancement of self-esteem in older adults (Y. S. Kim, 2001; Y. R. Kim, 2006; Ma, 2001). Additionally, S. H. Park and Park (2015) demonstrated that an integrated health and wellness program comprising nutritional guidance, exercise regimens, and psychological support contributed to heightened health consciousness among senior individuals. Notably, various local governments in South Korea have undertaken initiatives to provide an array of resources and programs designed to augment the well-being of retired baby boomers, encompassing aspects such as health, exercise, liberal arts, life design, retirement preparedness, and vocational education (Jang, 2021). Hence, this emerges as a potential avenue for promoting health ons iousness and enhan ing self-esteem.\nFurthermore, my analysis has revealed that health consciousness has a positive effect on successful aging. While direct research examining the correlation between increased health consciousness and successful aging remains limited, the existing literature has unveiled a link between health consciousness and health-promotion behaviors (Ha & Choi, 2013). For instance, J. J. Kim et al. (2013) demonstrated that the health-promotion behaviors exhibited by older adults engaging in community dance programs positively influence successful aging, and Ahn and Shin (2017) identified health-promotion behavior as a predictor of successful aging. In a similar vein, participation in leisure sports programs and activities has been shown to contribute to successful aging among older adults (C. I. Lee & Park, 2020; J. S. Lee, 2019), suggesting that engagement in recreational sports, possibly fueled by enhanced health consciousness, fosters the experience of successful aging. Korea witnessed a nearly twofold increase in medical expenditures for older adults over a 6-year period, from 19.9 trillion won in 2014 to 36.3 trillion won in 2020, with an anticipated escalation to approximately 91 trillion won by 2030 (H. G. Kang, 2021). This mounting financial strain on medical resources can be attributed to the rising prevalence of chronic ailments, such as hypertension and diabetes, accompanying the aging population. Consequently, the active development and dissemination of health-promotion initiatives that encompass the physical, mental, and social aspects of older adults within welfare facilities like senior centers, community halls, and senior classrooms--all conveniently accessible to local older adults--holds the potential to elicit increased health consciousness among those who participate in these programs. This strategic approach may alleviate the burden of healthcare costs and have a positive impact on the experience of successful aging among older adults.\nLast, I have ascertained that self-esteem bears a positive association with successful aging, which is congruent with earlier research (Bae, 2020; H. M. Kim, 2014; K. H. Lee, 2016). This suggests that elevated levels of self-esteem might foster an augmented sense of fulfillment and significance in daily life experiences (Han, 2001), thereby contributing to successful aging through the enhancement of mental well-being. Building on this premise, B. J. Lee and Hong (2012) proposed that leisure activities hold the potential to cultivate elevated self-esteem levels among older adults. Consequently, it is recommended that both governmental bodies and local authorities invest proactively in the development of proficient professionals capable of guiding leisure pursuits for older adults. Furthermore, the activation of leisure activity programs tailored to the preferences and motivations of older adults can foster enhanced self-esteem and an enriched experience of successful aging within this demographic.\nLimitations and Directions for Future Research",

        "abstract": "To test the relationship between social face consciousness (SFC) and life satisfaction (LS) among new employees in a Chinese context, we administered the Consciousness of Social Face Scale, the Satisfaction With Life Scale, the Perceived Social Support Scale, and the Ruminative Responses Scale to 624 employees with 1 year or less of service in the job market. The results showed that SFC had a significant negative predictive effect on new employees' LS, and indirectly affected new employees' LS through perceived social support. Further, rumination played a significant role in moderating the influence of SFC on new employees' LS; specifically, for new employees with a low level of rumination, SFC had no significant predictive effect on LS, whereas for those with a high level of rumination, SFC had a significant negative predictive effect on their LS. Thus, SFC inhibits new employees' LS and affects LS through the intermediary role of perceived social support, while rumination moderates this relationship. This study provides insight into how new employees can improve their LS in practice.\nKeywords\nnew employees, social face consciousness, life satisfaction, perceived social support, rumination\nIn recent years, positive factors such as life satisfaction (LS), subjective well-being, awe, optimism, and hope have received widespread research attention (Connolly & Garling, 2023; Dai & Jiang, 2023; Feldman et al., 2023). While happiness has been shown to be the most-reported life goal pursued, LS reflects how an individual evaluates their overall quality of life, and is therefore often regarded as a key indicator of subjective well-being (Kim et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021), which can predict an individual's physical and mental health (Uchino et al., 2016). In the increasingly competitive business environment, turning graduates into excellent employees is key for enterprises to maintain their talent competitiveness and growing sustainability (Hu et al., 2020). New employees must negotiate the transformation in their identity from student to employee, going through the adaptation process to workplace life. This major shift in identity and life can be a great challenge for new employees, and will have an important impact on their physical and mental development. Therefore, exploring the mechanism of new employees' LS is of great value in terms of understanding the psychological status of new employees, with a view to determining key time points for interventions if necessary.\nSocial Face Consciousness and New Employees' Life Satisfaction\nPersonality has been shown to be an important factor affecting individual LS. Previous studies have found that the Big Five personality traits (Hansson et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2021; Smith & Konik, 2021), positive personality traits (Y. L. Zhang et al., 2021), and proactive personality traits (S. L. Wang et al., 2019) can significantly predict LS. However, few scholars have paid attention to the relationship between \"social face,\" as the personality element, and LS. As a qualifier of social costs, social face, as understood throughout thousands of years of Chinese cultural heritage and deeply rooted in the hearts of the Chinese people, refers to the sequential or psychological status of someone in the eyes of others. Social face consciousness (SFC) refers to the consciousness that people have in terms of gaining face or avoiding loss of face in their social interactions, and there are two kinds: face struggle, namely, working to increase or gain face, and face protection, which entails attempting to avoid face damage (X.-A. Zhang et al., 2011). New employees with strong SFC often want to demonstrate excellence or show off their skills by exaggerating or boasting about their performance, and keeping their shortcomings unnoticed or hidden (C. Wang & Zhang, 2021). Therefore, when talking about their weaknesses, these employees find ways to redirect topics of conversation when necessary. This untrue self-presentation, however, has been found to be associated with a high level of social anxiety (Twomey & O'Reilly, 2017), which leads to a lower level of LS (L. Wang & Yao, 2020). Thus, we formed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: Social face consciousness will have a significantly negative predictive effect on new employees' life satisfaction.\nPerceived Social Support as a Mediator\nPerceived social support (PSS) refers to an individual's belief that others support and understand them (Sarason et al., 1991). As an important external resource, PSS is of great significance to people's physical and mental health (Chow et al., 2022; Hui et al., 2023). A study of laid-off workers showed that because of being embarrassed about their situation and afraid of being looked down upon by others, laid-off workers tend to reduce their social interactions to alleviate the social pressure they feel others exert on them, which leads to their feeling less social support (X. Y. Wang, 2005). According to the buffer theory perspective (Aneshensel & Stone, 1982), PSS can cushion the detrimental effects of negative stimuli on individuals, enabling them to avoid all kinds of negative emotions and helping them to better regulate the relationship between various adverse stimuli and their mental health (Jin et al., 2020). In addition, empirical studies have shown that PSS has a positive predictive effect on LS (Han et al., 2021; Miao et al., 2020). New employees with a low level of SFC do not consciously expect themselves to be sensational in front of their colleagues, nor will they feel ashamed or embarrassed for being, or feeling, inferior to their colleagues. Therefore, such new employees often do not feel greater psychological pressure and present themselves as having a relaxed state when interacting with colleagues. Such harmonious social communication often receives positive feedback from those with whom they are communicating, which results in their feeling a higher level of social support. Furthermore, when these new employees encounter difficulties, their high level of PSS enables them to feel the goodwill of their colleagues, which, in turn, feeds back into their developing a higher level of personal LS. We therefore proposed the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 2: Perceived social support will play a mediating role between social face consciousness and new employees' life satisfaction.\nRumination as a Moderator\nRumination refers to the act of continuously paying attention to all kinds of negative thoughts, particularly those related to oneself; individuals engaging in rumination repeatedly think about the causes and consequences of these negative thoughts, without actively solving the problem (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). Rumination has been shown to have a significant negative correlation with LS, and it can also negatively predict LS (Zheng et al., 2019). Previous research has shown that individuals with a high level of rumination tend to be entangled in past misbehaviors, and they repeatedly experience negative emotions such as regret (Allaert et al., 2023). If individuals are more inclined to pay attention to their own shortcomings and deficiencies, they then encode this negative information more concretely, which may lead to more rumination (Tafarodi et al., 2003). However, a high level of SFC means that individuals will pay more attention to their position in others' minds, and expect to cover up their shortcomings, performing well in front of others (C. Wang & Zhang, 2021), which is very similar to the behavior style of people with a high level of rumination. Individuals with a high level of rumination often experience high anxiety and depression (Dogan, 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Petwal et al., 2023), and low levels of LS (Zheng et al., 2019). When SFC and rumination work together, individuals not only hope that they can perform better than others, but also fear that their shortcomings may be revealed to their colleagues. When such individuals encounter negative events, they experience a variety of negative thoughts and find it difficult to let go of the negative effects of the event in a timely manner, making it more difficult to experience a higher level of LS. Therefore, we formed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 3: Rumination will play a moderating role in the influence of social face consciousness on new employees' life satisfaction, such that a high level of rumination will strengthen the negative effect of social face consciousness on life satisfaction.",

        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants and Procedure\nThe Ethics Committee of Inner Mongolia Normal University approved this study. Through a combination of cluster and individual sampling, we selected as participants new employees living in Liaoning Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, who had been in the job market for 1 year or less. All participants gave informed consent, then completed a paper-and-pencil survey in groups at suitable times at their workplace. The survey included questions about demographic variables (e.g., gender and age) and four scales: the Consciousness of Social Face Scale, the Satisfaction With Life Scale, the Perceived Social Support Scale, and the Ruminative Responses Scale. We handed out 700 questionnaires and collected 624 valid forms, for a response rate of 89.14%. Of the final sample, 286 were men (45.8%) and 338 were women (54.2%); the average age was 25.79 years (SD = 1.45, range = 22-28); 305 worked in state-owned enterprises (48.9%) and 319 in private enterprises (51.1%); and 141 held a junior college degree (22.6%) and 483 had a bachelor's degree (77.4%).\nMeasures\nSocial Face Consciousness\nThe Consciousness of Social Face Scale (X.-A. Zhang et al., 2011) comprises 11 items scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The scale includes two dimensions: desire to gain face (e.g., \"I hope people think that I can do better than most others\") and fear of losing face (e.g., \"I do my best to hide my weakness before others\"). In this study the Cronbach's alphas of the subscales were .86 and .85, respectively, and that of the scale as a whole was .90.\nLife Satisfaction\nThe Satisfaction With Life Scale (Diener et al., 1985) comprises five items scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). A sample item is \"I am satisfied with my life.\" The scale has a one-dimensional structure; the higher the total score, the higher the individual's level of LS. In this study the Cronbach's alpha of the scale was .88.\nPerceived Social Support\nThe Perceived Social Support Scale (Zimet et al., 1988) comprises 12 items scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The scale includes three dimensions: family support (e.g., \"My family really tries to help me\"), friend support (e.g., \"My friends really try to help me\"), and other support (e.g., \"There is a special person in my life who cares about my feelings\"). In this study the Cronbach's alpha of the subscales were .85, .83, and .83 respectively, and that of the scale as a whole was .89.\nRumination\nThe Ruminative Responses Scale (Treynor et al., 2003) comprises 22 items scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (always). The scale includes three dimensions: reflection (e.g., \"Go someplace alone to think about your feelings\"), brooding (e.g., \"Think 'Why can't I handle things better?'\"), and depression (e.g., \"Think about how sad you feel\"). In this study the Cronbach's alphas of the subscales were .73, .81, and .91 respectively, and that of the scale as a whole was .93.\nTest of Common Method Bias and Primary Analysis\nHarman's single-factor test was used to examine if there was common method bias in the data. We standardized all items. Results showed there were nine common factors with eigenvalues greater than 1, and the explanation rate of the first common factor was 23.21%; as this is less than the 40% cut-off (Podsakoff et al., 2003), we determined that there was no serious common method bias in this study.\nTable 1 shows the means and standard deviations of the principle variables. We first controlled for the demographic variables of gender, age, type of work unit, and educational background, and standardized the focal variables of SFC, PSS, rumination, and LS. The results showed that SFC was significantly and negatively correlated with PSS and new employees' LS, and significantly and positively correlated with rumination. PSS was significantly and negatively correlated with rumination, and significantly and positively correlated with new employees' LS. Rumination was significantly and negatively correlated with new employees' LS.\nHypothesis Testing\nModel 5 in PROCESS version 3.3 (Hayes, 2012) was employed to test the association between SFC and new employees' LS, and to determine whether PSS mediated and rumination moderated this relationship. Gender, age, type of work unit, and educational background served as control variables. The results (see Table 2) showed that SFC had a significant predictive effect on PSS and new employees' LS, and PSS significantly predicted new employees' LS. The direct effect of SFC on new employees' LS was significant (t = -4.02, p < .001). The indirect effect of PSS as a mediator of the relationship between SFC and new employees' LS was also significant, effect value -0.04. Thus, Hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported.\nAlso shown in Table 2, the interaction between SFC and rumination had a significant predictive effect on new employees' LS, 95% confidence interval [-0.13, -0.01]. To better explain the moderating function of rumination, we carried out a simple slope analysis. The results showed that for new employees with a low level of rumination (M - 1 SD), SFC had no significant predictive effect on LS (b = -0.12, SE = 0.07, t = -1.78, p > .05). However, for those with a high level of rumination (M + 1 SD), SFC had a significant negative predictive effect on their LS (b = -0.26, SE = 0.04, t = -6.48, p < .001). This supported Hypothesis 3.\nAndo', A., Giromini, L., Ales, F., & Zennaro, A. (2020). A multimethod assessment to study the relationship between rumination and gender differences.

        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe results of this study show that SFC significantly and negatively predicts new employees' LS, supporting Hypothesis 1. Previous findings have also shown that SFC can negatively predict LS (Chen & He, 2017), and face-saving behavior has been shown to cause Chinese-Americans to experience higher psychological pressure (Mak et al., 2009). For recently graduated employees new to the workplace, leaving campus to enter the workforce requires a complete transformation from student to employee identity in both body and mind. This stage of life also entails learning new work skills and sudden, intense accumulation of work experience. New employees often strive to show off their talents in the workplace, hoping to make a good impression on their leaders and colleagues. New employees with a strong sense of face are eager to avoid negative evaluations caused by losing face, and are more likely to exhibit behaviors that meet social expectations or social requirements, potentially ignoring their own inner needs or personal preferences. This eventually leads to damaging their sense of LS (C. X. Wang & Zhu, 2016).\nIn this study we also found that PSS plays a partial intermediary role in influencing the mechanism of SFC on new employees' LS, which supported Hypothesis 2. New employees with a strong level of SFC often have a high level of need to gain face as well as fearing losing face. Gaining face consciousness causes new employees to want to be better than others, which can include vanity, showing off, and boasting. Previous studies have shown that if individuals are more vain and more likely to show off or boast during interpersonal communications, this will often affect their maintenance and development of interpersonal relationships (F. Z. Yu, 2018). Eventually, when new employees encounter difficulties, the damage caused to their interpersonal relationships will result in them struggling to access the social support they require, making it difficult for them to feel a high level of PSS. Meanwhile, fear of losing face is reflected by new employees wanting to hide their shortcomings or deficiencies from others, so that when they face difficulties, they will tend to stay silent. This makes it difficult for others to understand the difficulties faced by the new employees at a point when they can offer necessary support, resulting in the new employees being unable to obtain a high level of PSS. Previous studies have also shown that there is a significant positive correlation between PSS and LS, and PSS can positively predict LS (Han et al., 2021; M. L. Yu et al., 2020). Therefore, when new employees have a high level of SFC, this will often lead to a lower level of PSS, which, in turn, leads to them experiencing a lower level of LS.\nIn addition, we found that rumination significantly moderates the relationship between SFC and new employees' LS, which supported Hypothesis 3. Specifically, for new employees with a low level of rumination, SFC has no significant predictive effect on LS. However, for those with a high level of rumination, SFC has a significant negative predictive effect on their LS. When the individual has a higher level of rumination, the scope of that individual's attention will be reduced, as well as their self-control (Jin et al., 2018). Thus, it is difficult for such individuals to face problems realistically, and easier for them to produce more negative emotions (Y. L. Wang et al., 2020). In life, individuals with a high level of rumination will repeatedly pay attention to their negative mood, habitually forcing themselves to think about their bad situation and reasons, and immersing themselves in sadness. This way of thinking will activate negative self-cognition (Feng et al., 2023), negative self-reference processing, and negative emotion, and persistent rumination impairs the individual's ability to problem solve and manage emotions, making this a maladaptive cognitive style (Ando' et al., 2020), which is closely related to depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other mental disorders (Dodd et al., 2019; Kertz et al., 2019; Kraus et al., 2020; Mihailova & Jobson, 2020). In addition, individuals with a high level of rumination are more likely than are those with a low level of rumination to be afraid of interacting with others, since they worry about not doing well and tend to immerse themselves in negative emotions in interpersonal communication (Qin & Peng, 2024), which will have a negative impact on their level of life satisfaction (Foroughi et al., 2022). In short, rumination is often accompanied by negative emotional experience. Repeated thinking and the resulting negative emotional experience are important factors that create the negative effect of SFC (C. Wang, 2023). Rumination, as a negative personality trait, will thus magnify the negative influence of SFC on new employees' LS.\nIn this study we examined the influence of SFC on new employees' LS, the mediating role of PSS, and the moderating role of rumination. We have provided theoretical references and practical understanding of how to improve the LS of new employees. First, the SFC of new employees can be reduced through special psychological interventions, such as induction training and inclusion as part of the daily work process. New employees can be influenced through the use of carefully chosen words or behaviors with the aim of reducing their level of SFC. Employers can also screen new employees for SFC through the use of questionnaires or interviews, and professional training can be carried out in the workplace to reduce their level of SFC with the goal of improving their LS. Second, in improving new employees' LS, long-term interventions related to their sense of PSS can also be considered. By encouraging new employees to focus on a positive and healthy attitude, they could be influenced to change their negative work and life patterns. Guiding new employees to develop an ideology of colleagues being like family could encourage them to actively seek help when they encounter difficulties or to lend a helping hand to others in need, thus improving new employees' ability to perceive social support through practice. This could also be considered as a way to improve new employees' ability to perceive social support through the reduction of their sense of social face, therefore leading to an improvement in their level of LS. Finally, by screening new employees for a high level of rumination by means of questionnaires or interviews, interventions could be introduced to reduce their level of rumination, such as expressive writing or mindfulness training. Encouraging new employees with a high level of rumination to participate in such activities could lead them to shift their inherent cognitive model to become more conducive to better moods and more skilled in objective cognitive ability, thus positively impacting their level of LS.\nThis study is subject to the following limitations: First, we distinguished between the types of work units of new employees, but did not distinguish between their occupations. In future research, we will examine the relationship between the SFC and LS of new employees with different occupations. Second, we focused on new employees and did not examine employees who have worked for many years. Can our research results be extended to long-term employees? This needs to be examined in future research. Third, we collected data mainly by means of a questionnaire survey, which means the results of the study may be affected by social desirability bias. We recommend verifying our current research results by means of experimental study approaches.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors have no known conflict of interest to disclose.\nThe raw data supporting the research conclusions can be obtained from the corresponding authors.",

        "introduction": "Introduction\nConsciousness generally refers to the feeling of 'self-awareness' [1]. However, the true scope of consciousness is broader than just self-awareness, as conscious control can guide thoughts and sensations towards appropriate responses [2]. All forms of voluntary motor responses require conscious control for achieving their desired effects. Similarly, we assimilate the meaning of sensory information when we are conscious of it. Consciousness is also actively involved in the processing of higher cognitive functions, which include thinking, reasoning, memory, and generating appropriate motor responses. These cognitive functions lack aptitude and meaning if we are consciously inattentive and distracted. Meticulous conscious control is necessary to explore memory for relevant images, perform calculations, and choose words for an appropriate response. Such processes require the prompt coordination of signals from different brain lobes in a specific order [3]. Since we can carry out these functions consciously, they would share an intimate relationship with conscious processes. Hence, an awareness of the 'whole-self' would be a more comprehensive term for consciousness than just 'self-awareness'. It seems that consciousness interacts with the cortical areas of cognition, and creates awareness and meaning in their functions. This interaction may occur through both short and long axonal extensions of cortical neurons, forming an intricate network of interwoven fibers within the deep white matter of the brain, connecting specific brain regions to facilitate coordination [4]. It can access and retrieve information from any lobe and connect it to the functions of other lobes to configure a productive response [5]. The network wired with different lobes and engendering symphony to the brain's processes could also be a potential venue for the genesis of consciousness. However, to date, there has not been a satisfactory explanation for either the nature or the mechanism of consciousness.\nThe brain possesses an inherent proclivity for the lateralization of its functions, wherein each hemisphere primarily governs specific functions [6]. For instance, comprehension and motor expression of language are well-developed in the left hemisphere as opposed to the right side of the brain [7]. Likewise, analysis and calculations, recognition of letters and numbers and whole word processing can be carried out by the left hemisphere [8]. Conversely, the right hemisphere is involved in interpreting creativity, perception, and recognition of faces, objects, and places [9]. It remains unclear whether conscious processes are more prevalent in one hemisphere of the brain as compared to the other. The concept is intriguing as recurring damage to focal areas of the brain in the setting of ischemic infarctions does not affect consciousness, and signifies that consciousness is a distributed function of the brain [10]. In this paper, we present our findings regarding consciousness disorders in cases of large segment occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. These findings support the modular distribution of conscious processes.",
        "methodology": "Objectives. The brain has an intrinsic tendency for the lateralization of its functions. For instance, the left hemisphere assists in the comprehension and motor expression of language. What remains uncertain is whether conscious processes are also more prevalent in one hemisphere of the brain than the other. The epistemic goal of this research was to address this particular issue. Materials and Methods. We observed the rare pathological event of proximal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), which halts blood flow to the central two-thirds of a hemisphere, and examined its effects on consciousness. We aggregated individual scores for eyes-opening and limb-motor responses from the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) to determine the conscious level, and used brain computed tomography imaging to identify the whole-territory infarcts of MCA. Results. Being a rare condition, we managed to recruit 35 patients from two centers (average age: 64.54 [+ or -] 13 years, 45.71% females). Whole-territory infarcts of the MCA occurred more frequently in the left hemisphere (22 versus 13, frequency: 62.85%). Unconsciousness was also more common with left hemisphere infarctions (16 versus 2 unconscious patients of the right hemisphere, Frequency: 72%, GCS: 2/10=3/22 cases, GCS: 5/10=1/22 cases, GCS: 6-7/10=12/22 cases). The difference in unconsciousness proved significant in Fisher's exact analysis (p-value = 0.001) and remained independent of age (p-value=0.7247) and gender (p-value=0.3145). Moreover, six conscious patients with left hemisphere involvement exhibited a loss of conscious control for normal responses, implying a strong link between consciousness and cognition. Unconsciousness also correlated with stroke outcomes (16 Unconscious: 56.25% deceased within the hospital). Conclusion. Conscious processes are more predominant in the brain's left hemisphere. Our observations indicate that only a gross unilateral insult to the brain can lead to unconsciousness.\nKeywords:\nConsciousness, cognition, infarction, middle cerebral artery, hemiplegia, Glasgow coma scale\nMaterials and Methods\nA prevalent distribution of conscious processes within one hemisphere could lead to frequent episodes of unconsciousness from recurrent dysfunction in that hemisphere. Therefore, we employed the pathological event of ischemic infarction which was large enough and could dysfunction the whole hemisphere with certainty [11]. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) in each hemisphere was particularly suitable for our study, given its extensive territory covering the central two-thirds of a hemisphere [12]. More proximal occlusion of the MCA leads to a nearly complete dysfunction of the hemisphere due to pronounced ischemia, effectively interrupting signaling within the hemisphere [13]. We obtained sample from two different centers as well-developed infarctions of proximal MCA were infrequent, likely due to patients arriving promptly for better treatment.\nEthical approval, study design and statistics\nThis is a prospective, cross-sectional observational study in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to proximal segment occlusion of MCA. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the review board of the District Headquarter Teaching Hospital Kohat (registration No. 2965/K-17). Prior to their participation in the study, a written informed consent was obtained from a close relative of each patient. Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20. We assessed levels of consciousness using the Glasgow Coma Scale and determined the severity of stroke using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) [14]. Tables were used to compare the severity of stroke and levels of unconsciousness between the two hemispheres. We employed Fisher's exact test to evaluate the significance of consciousness disorder in a specific hemisphere.\nNeuroimaging criteria for the large segment's occlusion\nThe neurovascular territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is the central two-thirds of a hemisphere. Middle cerebral artery is a continuation of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery. It is divided into five segments, M1 to M5, where M1 and M2 are denoted as large segments of MCA [12]. These large segments give penetrating branches to the ipsilateral basal ganglia, internal capsule and the deep white matter of the hemisphere. The anatomical course and the territory of MCA are shown in Figure 1. Being the main part, M1 segment's occlusion produces a major infarction by limiting blood supply to a large part of the hemisphere. A characteristic pattern formed by the proximal occlusion of the MCA is a confluent signal of infarction involving the internal capsule, basal ganglia, and the insula, as shown in Figure 2. It extends to all lobes of the brain except the occipital lobe.\nSignificance of MCA's territory for consciousness\nThe middle cerebral artery covers a substantial volume of the brain, which approximates to two-thirds of a hemisphere. It supplies specialized groups of cells within important lobes, including the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. These cells are located in the sensory association areas of the brain, where they interpret conscious meanings of sensory information, facilitate thinking, and engage in reasoning [15]. They assist in language comprehension and analysis of the three-dimensional position of an object. Occluding the main stem of the MCA turns the whole territory into a dead tissue. This not only disrupts signaling within the same hemisphere but also hinders communication with the contralateral hemisphere. It was likely to produce unconsciousness if conscious processes were more prevalent in the affected hemisphere.\nClinimetric assessment of consciousness\nWe employed Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) for the assessment of conscious level. This clinimetric scale has numerical scoring for three motor responses that include eyes opening, speech and the limbs' movement. The cumulative score of all three components represents the conscious level of a patient [16]. The detail of the numerical scoring is given in Table 1. Aphasia due to stroke is a clinical limitation to the GCS score as it produces a false-positive decrement of 5 verbal points to the conscious level despite the normal scores for eyes and limbs. For this reason, verbal response scoring was not included and categorization of conscious level was entirely based on the eyes and limbs' responses. Hence, the cumulative scores of seven or less for the eyes and limbs represented an altered conscious level, and scores of eight to ten represented a normal conscious level in our patients. We evaluated the symptoms of a major stroke using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and confirmed the presence of a whole-territory infarction of the MCA with brain computed tomography (CT) imaging performed in the emergency department.\nInclusion criteria\nThe main determinants of patients' selection in our study were the following,\n* Patient of any age with a normal behavior and orientation about self before the onset of the stroke. This information was obtained through general observations made by immediate family members of the patient prior to the stroke event.\n* Well-developed infarction of proximal MCA on the brain CT at presentation.\n* Patients arriving within 48 hours of symptoms' onset at the hospital with no significant edema of ischemic core on brain CT that could contribute to unconsciousness.\nExclusion criteria\nThe following comorbid conditions and risk factors that could contribute to unconsciousness were carefully excluded.\n* Patients with metabolic derangements like liver cirrhosis, renal failure, and hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance.\n* Concurrent fits with stroke.\n* Previous documentation of a major stroke that caused significant loss of brain volume in the territory of MCA.\n* Raised intracranial pressure due to marked hemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic core.\nData availability\nAnonymized data will be shared with any researcher upon request.",
        "results": "Results\nPatients' demographics and clinical presentation\nA fully resolved infarction of the proximal M1 segment was a rare clinical presentation due to earlier arrival of patients for better treatment. A total of 35 patients were enrolled in the study from September 24, 2020 till May 07, 2022. Of these, twenty-two patients had involvement of the left hemisphere (22 versus 13, frequency: 62.85%, odds: 1.69). Male and female participants constituted 19 (54.28%) and 16 (45.71%) respectively, with a mean age of 64.54 [+ or -] 13 years (range: 32 to 95). Severe contralateral hemiplegia and facial weakness were common in the proximal occlusion of MCA, leading to a baseline NIHSS score of 11 for stroke in either hemisphere. Aphasia and cognitive deficits in comprehension were commonly seen in the left hemisphere's stroke that contributed to a higher severity of NIHSS (range: 15 to 18). This was attributed to patients' inability to respond to consciousness-related questions within the NIHSS. Contralateral hemisensory neglect was prevalent in right hemisphere strokes, with no impact on comprehension, resulting in a reduced NIHSS severity (range: 11 to 17).\nThe hemisphere prone to unconsciousness\nA striking difference was observed in the GCS scores of the two hemispheres. Patients with left hemisphere involvement were more prone to unconsciousness as compared to the right hemisphere (16 versus only 2 unconscious patients of the right hemisphere, OR: 14.63, 95% CI: 2.47-86.05). Their level of consciousness significantly declined to the lowest GCS scores (Frequency: 72%, GCS: 2/10=3/22 cases, GCS: 5/10=1/22 cases, GCS: 6/10=7/22 cases, GCS: 7/10=5/22 cases). In comparison, only 2 patients with right hemisphere involvement attained the upper cutoff mark of 7/10 GCS for unconsciousness (Frequency: 15%, GCS: 7/10=2/13 cases). The raised intracranial pressure from cerebral edema was probably not contributing to the current difference of unconsciousness, given that the volume of infarctions and the time elapsed before the documentation of unconsciousness--within 48 hours--were similar for both hemispheres. The observed difference in unconsciousness as interpreted with the Fisher's exact test, proved significant and was unlikely due to chance (p-value= 0.001). It signified a left predominant distribution of conscious processes in most individuals. Among the eleven conscious patients of the right hemisphere with normal comprehension, as well as six conscious patients of the left hemisphere with no comprehension for NIHSS questions, it was highly likely that a prevailing left-sided distribution of conscious processes existed. Hence, a total of 33 patients exhibited a left-prevalent distribution of conscious processes (94%), aligning with the left hemisphere's dominance for right-handedness, speech, and language comprehension in the general population (90%). The tendency for unconsciousness was independent of age (p-value=0.7247), and gender (p-value= 0.3145), as shown in Table 2.\nSeverity and outcome of stroke\nUnconscious patients in either hemisphere had NIHSS scores 6 points higher than conscious patients of the right hemisphere. Nine of sixteen unconscious patients of the left hemisphere deceased within 7 to 10 days of hospital stay (16 Unconscious; NIHSS: 18/42; 56.25% deceased, 6 Conscious; NIHSS: 15-18/42, all alive within the hospital). The occurrence of severe aspiration pneumonia subsequent to unconsciousness probably contributed to their high mortality rate. A few conscious patients of the left hemisphere also attained higher NIHSS scores of 18 due to the Wernicke's aphasia. In contrast, conscious patients of the right hemisphere had a suboptimum severity of NIHSS due to normal cognition, which helped them respond correctly to the consciousness-related questions within the NIHSS (2 Unconscious; NIHSS: 17/42, 11 Conscious; NIHSS: 11-15/42). Table 3 depicts individual scores of patients in the two hemispheres.",
        "discussion": "Discussions\nWe observed the catastrophic event of proximal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and examined its effects on consciousness, sensory-motor functions, and in-hospital mortality within 48 hours of symptom onset, prior to the development of cerebral edema. The MCA is a major and central vessel in the anterior circulation, sustaining vital structures of the brain covering the lateral convexity of the central two-thirds of a hemisphere. In addition to the basal nuclei in the deep white matter, the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes fall within the territory of MCA. These structures have a significant contribution to the conscious interpretation of comprehension, orientation, reasoning and thinking. In the wake of proximal occlusion of MCA with a gross and rapid loss of function in these structures, we were able to ascertain quantitative differences in the distribution of conscious processes between the two hemispheres. A fully developed infarct of the whole territory of MCA was an uncommon observation due to awareness in the general population about better treatment outcomes within the first few hours of stroke. The M1-segment of the left MCA was more susceptible to occlusion than the right MCA. 62.85% of the patients had involvement of the left MCA. Hedna et al had a similar observation in their study [17]. A plausible explanation is that the left common carotid artery originates directly from the aortic arch in the superior mediastinum, whereas the right common carotid artery arises from the brachiocephalic trunk. This makes the left MCA more prone to the embolic events. It is also possible that the left hemisphere might have greater metabolic demands than the right. The baseline severity of motor weakness, resulting in contralateral hemiplegia and facial weakness was similar for both hemispheres. These deficits led to a baseline NIHSS score of 11 points. However, left hemisphere involvement added 3 to 6 points of severity on NIHSS compared to the right side. Factors contributing to increased severity in these patients included unconsciousness, aphasia, and lack of comprehension to verbal questions within the NIHSS. Out of 22 left hemisphere cases, 21 patients scored 16 to 18 points, while 1 patient scored 15 points on the NIHSS. In comparison, patients with right hemisphere involvement often exhibited lower severity on the NIHSS. They usually had intact cognition and speech, and were able to respond to the verbal questions. Hemisensory neglect on the contralateral side was a common deficit in these patients. Out of 13 patients of the right hemisphere, 10 patients scored between 11 to 14 points, while 2 unconscious patients attained 16 to 18 points. Other studies also corroborate lower functional outcomes and higher NIHSS scores in left hemisphere lesions [17,18].\nThe left hemisphere regulates critical functions of the brain. Of these, the comprehension of written and spoken language and its motor expression are distinctive functions. In addition, it determines self-orientation of normal behavior and right-handedness in 90% of the general population [19,20]. The self-orientation of sound behavior is what represents our normal cognition. The thinking, reasoning, memory and appropriate motor response were severely affected in the left hemisphere's stroke. Hence, the left hemisphere has greater significance in facilitating day-to-day activities. The contiguity of many specialized functions within the left hemisphere would definitely give it leverage in decision-making over the right hemisphere. For instance, comprehension and motor expression of language are well-developed in the left hemisphere, and it would need less assistance from the right hemisphere to generate appropriate verbal responses. Our results clearly show predominant distribution of conscious processes in the left hemisphere. Its dysfunction frequently produced unconsciousness, indicating that conscious processes were more concentrated in the left hemisphere. Out of 22 patients of the left hemisphere, 16 became unconscious in the acute phase of stroke within the first 24 hours. There was neither any significant edema of the ischemic core nor a midline shifts on the initial brain CT that could suggest the possibility of raised intracranial pressure. Hence, unconsciousness in these patients was purely related to the loss of function in the left hemisphere and not due to global rise in intracranial pressure. Their level of consciousness dropped significantly to the lower limits of the 10-point Glasgow coma scale. Out of 16 unconscious patients of the left hemisphere, 4 patients attained 2-5 points, 7 patients scored 6 points, while 5 patients scored 7 points. Only two cases of the right hemisphere developed unconsciousness, and each scored 7 points. Variation in the severity of unconsciousness was only observed in the left hemisphere stroke, suggesting that conscious processes were predominantly skewed to the left. This characterization of a quantitative difference in the content distribution of consciousness between the two hemispheres has been documented for the first time and is testable. The leftbiased distribution of conscious processes has several scientific implications. Notably, consciousness works similar to other ordinary functions of the brain in that its processes are also more predominant on one side. Our finding also provides insights into the basic questions about the nature and existence of consciousness within the brain. If it is testable, it is unequivocally a brain- derived function that stems from the ordinary activity of cortical neurons. The manifestation of unconsciousness due to dysfunction in two-thirds of the left hemisphere signifies that the neurons and their connections determining consciousness span over a widespread area of the brain. Consequently, consciousness is a substantial functional component within the consciousness-cognition pair.\nUnconsciousness was also related to the increased mortality. Nine of sixteen unconscious patients of the left hemisphere died during their hospital stay. The increased severity of aspiration pneumonia in the unconscious patients probably contributed to their high mortality. It would have not been related to the possibility of brain herniation as conscious patients of both the hemispheres also had similar infarctions and there was no incidence of sudden death to suggest brain herniation. They developed aspiration pneumonia subsequent to unconsciousness. While sixteen of twenty-two cases of the left hemisphere were unconscious, the remaining six patients also had no conscious control for an appropriate response and behavior. They were unable to interpret and respond to simple questions such as 'close your eyes', 'protrude your tongue', and 'raise the unaffected left upper limb'. It was indicating a strong link between the processes of consciousness and cognition in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex. It appears that consciousness and cognition are strongly linked and do not dissociate. Disrupting cognition will impair conscious control for self-orientation of normal behavior and vice versa. In other words, there is an abundance of cortically assigned areas of consciousness in the left hemisphere that link different areas of cognition with subcortical neuronal fibers of coordination. We have illustrated this interaction with a simplified scheme in Figure 3.\nIn this model, we identify two distinct types of cortical attributes--one for consciousness and the other for cognition. Attributes specific to consciousness stimulate the cortical attributes of cognition for a particular function in a sequence and add conscious meaning to the intended function. For instance, developing a conscious thought about a cup of coffee in our mind requires stimulation of several different aspects of cognition for the intended thought. Most of these aspects pertain to the cup's shape, color, and the taste, warmth, and color of the coffee. If these aspects are considered individually, and are not coordinated, the thought of a cup of coffee would not be generated in our mind. A complete understanding of the intended thought only forms when all the relevant aspects are connected and stimulated sequentially. Hence, coordinating the cortical aspects of cognition gives meaning and awareness to the intended thought. If we imagine the shape of a 'glass' without activating other aspects like its name, texture, use, and how it's held, we won't be able to create a meaningful mental image. We propose that cortical attributes of consciousness primarily govern this coordination.\nConscious-control can dominate cognition if most of the subcortical fibers belong to the cortical areas of consciousness [3,5]. The fibers can stimulate different areas of cognition in a sequence to develop thinking, reasoning and appropriate motor response. The predominance of conscious processes throughout an entire hemisphere also carries a clinical implication; the presence of unconsciousness should be indicative of a profound brain insult rather than a localized injury. The idea of an extensive area of the brain governing consciousness is further substantiated by the observation of unconsciousness in disorders that result in whole-brain dysfunction. These conditions include generalized seizures, hypoglycemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, midbrain infarction and systemic shock [21-23]. Preserved consciousness in split-brain syndrome and altered consciousness in unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy are further clinical observations that support prevalent distribution of consciousness in either hemisphere [24,25]. The limitations of our study are a limited sample size and observing a time-lapse of 24 to 48 hours before the assessment of unconsciousness. In a future study, we recommend observing unconsciousness by confirming the proximal occlusion of MCA with CT angiography and major infarct core with CT perfusion scan in the first few hours of stroke. Subsequent results would be more persuasive as the possibility of elevated pressure due to a major stroke will be alleviated.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusions\nA major infarction resulting from the proximal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery is a catastrophic event. It has higher mortality and morbidity when it affects the left hemisphere. We observed that the left hemisphere involvement often leads to unconsciousness, indicating that conscious processes are predominantly localized in the left hemisphere as compared to the right. The expected tendency for unconsciousness on the left in 35 patients was 94% that coincided with the left hemisphere dominance for handedness, speech, and comprehension in the general population (90%). Consciousness seems to involve a process of coordination that connects different cognitive areas sequentially. This sequential activation generates meaning and awareness in the cognitive process. Consciousness and cognition are intimately connected in the cerebral cortex, and individual dysfunction of either as a whole is impossible. Consciousness is the broader entity in the consciousness-cognition pair, and loss of its function generally requires dysfunction of two-thirds of the respective hemisphere.\nHighlights\n* There is no satisfactory explanation for the nature or mechanism of consciousness. This paper presents the first scientific evidence of modular distribution of conscious processes.\n* Given that the left hemisphere is dominant in 90% of individuals for right-handedness and language, it also exhibits a prevalent distribution of conscious processes and likely governs conscious control for appropriate responses.\nAcknowledgments\nWe extend our gratitude to Dr. Nasir Afridi, In-charge and Medical Superintendent at DHQ Teaching Hospital KDA Kohat, for his invaluable administrative support in our research.

        "introduction": "Introduction\nLanguage teaching has witnessed the emergence and evolution of various teaching approaches over time. While some approaches have gained more prominence than others, scholars acknowledge that no approach is flawless. Additionally, certain approaches are recognized for their effectiveness in honing specific skills rather than others. For instance, communicative language teaching (CLT) and content and language-integrated learning (CLIL) are deemed crucial for oral skill development, whereas genre-based pedagogy predominantly focuses on written texts [1]. More recently, a novel approach known as PBLT has surfaced in the literature [2-4]. This approach has proven to assist EFL learners not only in enhancing speaking and writing skills but also in developing critical thinking skills. PBLT revolves around two central elements: posing philosophical questions and viewing the classroom as a community of inquiry. The approach stems from the observation that when philosophical questions arise in the EFL class, learners spontaneously engage and feel motivated to participate actively in discussions.\nPBLT, centered around posing philosophical questions and viewing the classroom as a community of inquiry [2-4], emerges from the observation that when philosophical questions arise in the EFL class [4], learners spontaneously engage and feel motivated to participate actively in discussions [3]. This active involvement goes beyond the surface of language acquisition, delving into the realm of critical thinking. As learners grapple with philosophical inquiries, they are prompted to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information, fostering a cognitive process that extends beyond the immediate linguistic context [3]. In this way, philosophy-based language instruction serves as a catalyst for nurturing critical thinking skills among EFL learners [5].\nCritical thinking is a foundational skill essential for effective decision-making and problem-solving in education and beyond [6]. In the realm of language instruction, critical thinking goes beyond the mere acquisition of language skills, involving the ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information [7]. PBLT has emerged as a distinctive approach fostering critical thinking skills among EFL learners [8-9]. Through the exploration of philosophical questions, students are encouraged to question assumptions, consider alternative viewpoints, and articulate well-reasoned responses. Engagement with complex philosophical inquiries not only deepens linguistic proficiency but also nurtures cognitive processes associated with critical thinking. PBLT provides a unique space where learners actively participate in discussions, offering them the opportunity to navigate linguistic and conceptual complexities simultaneously. As a result, critical thinking becomes an integral aspect of language learning within the framework of PBLT, contributing to the development of discerning and analytically astute language learners.\nEngagement involves showcasing learning motivation, where learners direct energy and effort toward achieving specific educational goals [10-11]. Defining student engagement comprises three interconnected dimensions: behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Behavioral engagement encompasses active student participation in learning activities, such as posing questions and completing assignments [12]. Emotional engagement relates to students' feelings regarding teachers, peers, or the learning process, including reactions like interest, boredom, happiness, sadness, and anxiety during a course [13]. The core concept of cognitive engagement focuses on the depth of investment in learning, highlighting a psychological commitment to mastering knowledge and skills rather than merely completing tasks [12]. Therefore, cognitive engagement can be understood as students' grasp of the subject matter being taught [14].\nAcademic achievement is a multifaceted concept encompassing the attainment of knowledge, skills, and competencies within an educational context [15]. In the field of language instruction, academic achievement is often measured by students' proficiency in language skills, successful completion of language courses, and performance in assessments [16]. PBLT emerges as a dynamic approach that not only enhances linguistic proficiency but also contributes to broader academic achievement [2-3].\nThe contemporary landscape of language instruction is characterized by a myriad of teaching approaches, each offering unique strengths and challenges. While approaches such as CLT and content and language-integrated learning CLIL have gained prominence for their efficacy in specific skill development, a critical examination reveals that no singular approach is without its limitations [1]. Moreover, the emphasis on honing particular skills often overshadows the holistic development of learners. In this context, the recent emergence of PBLT introduces a novel dimension to language instruction by not only enhancing speaking and writing skills but also fostering critical thinking abilities among EFL learners [2-4]. However, despite the promising indications, a comprehensive investigation into the efficacy of PBLT in comparison to traditional approaches is notably absent in the current literature. This research gap prompts the need for a focused exploration into the consequences of philosophy-based language instruction on EFL learners' critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement. By addressing this gap, the study seeks to contribute valuable insights that can inform language educators and policymakers about the potential benefits and challenges associated with the integration of PBLT in EFL classrooms.\nThis study aims to achieve three overarching objectives that collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the impact of PBLT on EFL learners. Firstly, the investigation seeks to understand the effect of PBLT on critical thinking skills among EFL learners. This involves a close examination of how the integration of philosophy-based language instruction influences cognitive processes such as analysis, evaluation, and synthesis. By assessing the impact on critical thinking, the study aims to illuminate the cognitive dimensions that PBLT brings to language learning.\nSecondly, the study aims to assess the effect of PBLT on learner engagement. This involves an exploration of the extent to which philosophy-based language teaching enhances learner motivation and active participation in the language learning process. The investigation encompasses the examination of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive dimensions of engagement, providing insights into how PBLT contributes to creating a stimulating and participatory classroom environment.\nLastly, the study seeks to evaluate the effect of PBLT on academic achievement. This involves a comprehensive assessment of the impact of philosophy-based language instruction on traditional measures of academic success, including language proficiency, course completion rates, and performance in assessments. By examining both linguistic and broader academic competencies, the study aims to provide a holistic understanding of how PBLT influences learners' overall academic achievement within the EFL context. Accordingly, the study addresses the following research questions:\n1. How does PBLT affect learners' critical thinking?\n2. How does PLBT affect learners' engagement?\n3. What is the effect of PBLT on learners' academic achievement?\nTheoretical background\nPhilosophy-based Language instruction\nAccording to Vygotsky [17], elevated levels of thinking skills, particularly abstract thinking, can be attained through mediated tools like language. The specific type of language use conducive to knowledge discovery is dialogic question-and-answer interactions. In essence, it is the exploratory talk that engages learners in expanding their knowledge by experimenting with new ideas and receiving feedback from their interlocutor [18]. This contrasts with well-structured, pre-planned presentational speeches, especially in dialogues about fundamental philosophical matters. In this context, the term philosophy, in line with [19]'s paradigm, denotes small 'p' philosophy, aiming to assist learners in constructing a critical perspective on central life concepts rather than accepting everything exposed to them as absolute truth.\nThe tradition of dialogic philosophical questioning in education traces back to Socrates approximately 2500 years ago [20]. Drawing inspiration from Dewey's [21] concept of \"reflexive inquiry,\" [19] reinvigorated Socratic questioning by proposing the use of philosophy for children, primarily aiming to instill critical thinking skills in young learners. This involves establishing a community of inquiry (see, for example, [22]), where individuals actively engage in knowledge production through profound contemplation of various life issues, facilitated by the exchange of questions and answers [23]. Participants collaboratively construct and address their own philosophical questions based on specific input resources, fostering a sense of responsibility for their learning. Employing higher-order thinking skills in conjunction with cooperation, learners develop a social understanding of fundamental assumed beliefs and life concepts, subsequently enhancing their reasoning abilities and self-esteem [24]. Haynes [25] advocates for creating communities of inquiry in the classroom, asserting that children should be encouraged and provided opportunities to participate in society from an early age in meaningful contexts such as families, schools, and other settings where they have a stake.\nIt is crucial to underscore that philosophical dialogues within a community of inquiry diverge from ordinary conversations, where the focus is on participants' personal ideas. In contrast, in the former, the aim is to collectively construct ideas from peers' comments to address problems. The primary motivating factor for participants in a community of inquiry to sustain their discussions is the pursuit of truth, a dimension absents in casual conversations [26].\nWhile learners take the lead in classroom discussions and philosophical question-and-answer activities, it's crucial to note that the teacher is not passive; instead, they play an active role in guiding learners to clarify and simplify their ideas. However, the teacher refrains from dominating the discussion. The mediator appreciates learners' capabilities in knowledge creation and interpretation of reality embedded in the dialogues [27].\nCritical thinking\nThe theoretical underpinnings of critical thinking draw from various educational and philosophical perspectives, emphasizing the development of cognitive skills and the ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information. Scholars in the field of education have often turned to influential frameworks and models to conceptualize and understand critical thinking.\nOne prominent model is Bloom's Taxonomy of Cognitive Objectives, developed by Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues [28]. This taxonomy categorizes cognitive skills into a hierarchy, ranging from lower-order thinking skills (remembering, understanding) to higher-order thinking skills (applying, analyzing, evaluating, creating). Critical thinking is situated at the top of this hierarchy, emphasizing the ability to evaluate information and make reasoned judgments.\nAdditionally, the Paul-Elder Critical Thinking Framework, developed by Richard Paul and Linda Elder, provides a comprehensive model that identifies essential components of critical thinking, such as clarity, accuracy, relevance, and depth [29]. This framework encourages educators to guide learners in developing intellectual traits and habits associated with effective critical thinking.\nIn the realm of language education, scholars like Ennis have proposed specific dimensions of critical thinking relevant to language learners, including interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, explanation, and self-regulation [30]. These dimensions align with the cognitive processes involved in language comprehension, production, and analysis.\nEmpirical background",
        "methodology": "This study investigates the impact of Philosophy-Based Language Teaching (PBLT) on the critical thinking skills and learner engagement of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students. A concurrent mixed-methods approach, including semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and academic achievement tests, was employed with an experimental group (EG) exposed to PBLT and a control group (CG) receiving traditional instruction. The results reveal a substantial positive effect of PBLT on the critical thinking abilities of EFL learners, as evidenced by thematic analyses of interviews and document content. Themes include heightened critical thinking awareness, collaborative knowledge construction, and increased learner engagement. Academic achievement tests further demonstrate significant improvement in the experimental group's performance. A comparison with existing literature underscores the novelty of our mixed-methods approach. Implications for language teachers, materials developers, syllabus designers, and policy-makers are discussed, highlighting the potential of PBLT in cultivating critical thinking and learner engagement.\nKeywords: Academic achievement, Critical thinking, Engagement, Philosophy-based Language Teaching\nAuthor(s): Lingxi Li1 , Sayed M. Ismail2 , Indrajit Patra3 and Desta Lami4\nThis study aims to achieve three primary objectives that hold significant implications for both language educators and policymakers. Firstly, by investigating the effect of PBLT on critical thinking skills among EFL learners, the study offers insights into how philosophy-based language instruction shapes cognitive processes essential for effective language acquisition. Understanding this impact not only enriches our knowledge of language learning methodologies but also provides educators with evidence-based strategies to enhance learners' critical thinking abilities, which are crucial for navigating an increasingly complex world. Secondly, by assessing the effect of PBLT on learner engagement, the study contributes to our understanding of how philosophy-based approaches can foster a more stimulating and participatory classroom environment. This knowledge equips educators with tools to create learning environments that promote active participation and motivation, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of language education. Lastly, by evaluating the effect of PBLT on academic achievement, the study informs policymakers about the broader implications of philosophy-based language instruction on traditional measures of academic success. This understanding can guide policy decisions regarding curriculum development, teacher training, and resource allocation, ultimately shaping the direction of language education policies to better serve the needs of EFL learners.\nThe significance of this study lies in its exploration of the innovative PBLT approach and its potential impact on critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement among EFL learners. In the ever-evolving landscape of language instruction, the recognition that no single approach is flawless underscores the need for continuous exploration and refinement. Methods, including CLT and CLIL, have demonstrated effectiveness in specific skill development but may not holistically address the multifaceted nature of language acquisition.\nThe emergence of PBLT as a distinctive approach represents an opportunity to delve into its unique qualities, particularly in enhancing speaking and writing skills while concurrently fostering critical thinking abilities. Through the deliberate integration of philosophical questions and the establishment of a community of inquiry, PBLT engages learners in a cognitive process that extends beyond immediate linguistic contexts. The study seeks to unravel the significance of this approach in nurturing critical thinking skills, providing valuable insights into how language instruction can transcend traditional boundaries.\nMoreover, the examination of learner engagement within the context of PBLT extends beyond the surface of active participation to explore the intricate dimensions of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. By investigating these interconnected elements, the study aims to shed light on how PBLT creates a dynamic and stimulating classroom environment that encourages learners to direct their energy and effort toward achieving educational goals. This exploration is crucial in understanding the broader impact of PBLT on the motivation and commitment of EFL learners.\nFurthermore, the study's focus on academic achievement adds a crucial layer to the investigation, expanding beyond linguistic proficiency to encompass traditional measures of success such as course completion rates and performance in assessments. PBLT, as a dynamic approach, holds the potential not only to enhance language skills but also to contribute to the overall academic achievement of EFL learners.\nIn essence, this research aims to bridge a notable gap in the literature by providing a thorough examination of the consequences of philosophy-based language instruction on critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement. The findings of this study are anticipated to offer educators, policymakers, and researchers' valuable insights into the potential benefits and challenges associated with the integration of PBLT in EFL classrooms, contributing to the ongoing discourse on effective language instruction strategies and their broader educational implications.\nLiterature review\nFurthermore, philosophical perspectives, particularly those influenced by the Socratic method, have long been intertwined with the conceptualization of critical thinking. The Socratic method emphasizes questioning, dialogue, and reflective inquiry to stimulate critical thought and illuminate underlying assumptions.\nIn the context of PBLT, the works of Lipman and Sharp contribute to the theoretical foundation. Lipman's Philosophy for Children (P4C) approach advocates for integrating philosophy into education, fostering a community of inquiry where students engage in collaborative philosophical discussions [24].\nThis theoretical background demonstrates the multidimensional nature of critical thinking, drawing from educational models, philosophical traditions, and language education frameworks. The integration of these perspectives offers a comprehensive foundation for understanding and fostering critical thinking skills among learners.\nEngagement\nLearners' engagement is defined by the student's willingness to actively participate in daily school activities, such as attending class, completing assignments, and attentively listening to the teacher. A low level of classroom engagement can lead to adverse effects on both learning performance and the overall learning process [31]. In this context, [32] highlighted that student engagement results from effective classroom teaching and school development initiatives, signifying its increasingly crucial role [33]. underscored the importance of dynamic and collaborative learning, academic activities, effective communication with the teacher, and educational experiences within the realm of classroom engagement.\nLearners' engagement is a multifaceted construct that encompasses various cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dimensions within the educational context. Grounded in educational psychology, engagement is commonly defined as the extent to which students actively participate in and are committed to their learning experiences [34]. Fredricks, Blumenfeld, and Paris proposed a conceptual model that identifies three core components of student engagement: behavioral engagement, emotional engagement, and cognitive engagement [12]. Behavioral engagement involves participating in classroom activities and adhering to academic tasks, while emotional engagement pertains to the affective reactions and sentiments students associate with their learning. Cognitive engagement focuses on the investment of mental effort, active participation in complex cognitive tasks, and the application of higher-order thinking skills [12].\nSkinner and Belmont further emphasized the reciprocal relationship between teacher behavior and student engagement, highlighting the role of teachers in cultivating an environment conducive to sustained learner involvement [35]. Educational researchers have extended the scope of engagement to encompass not only academic activities within the classroom but also extracurricular pursuits and the broader school climate [36]. Mahoney, Cairns, and Farmer, for instance, identified extracurricular activity participation as a significant factor contributing to interpersonal competence and educational success [36].\nMoreover, Appleton, Christenson, and Furlong have drawn attention to the critical conceptual and methodological considerations associated with the construct of student engagement, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding that considers both its cognitive and affective dimensions [37]. Recognizing the dynamic interplay between various factors, including classroom dynamics, social interactions, and a sense of belonging, offers a comprehensive theoretical foundation for understanding and promoting learners' engagement in diverse educational settings [37].\nIn summary, the theoretical background of learners' engagement draws from foundational models like the one proposed by Fredricks, Blumenfeld, and Paris, which conceptualizes engagement as a multidimensional construct involving behavioral, emotional, and cognitive components. The reciprocal influence of teacher behavior, the impact of extracurricular activities, and the broader school climate further enrich our understanding of the complex dynamics that contribute to learners' engagement in educational contexts.\nAcademic and language achievement\nLanguage achievement is a nuanced and intricate concept reflecting an individual's competence and proficiency in a specific language [38]. It transcends mere knowledge of grammar and vocabulary, encompassing the ability to comprehend, utilize, and communicate effectively in both written and spoken forms. This process of achievement is dynamic, evolving over time, influenced by factors such as language exposure, formal instruction, learner motivation, and individual learning preferences [39]. It signifies an ongoing journey of improvement, where individuals strive to enhance their language skills through dedicated practice, immersion in authentic language contexts, and active engagement within language communities [40].\nThe assessment of language achievement is a multifaceted undertaking that encompasses a range of evaluation methods [41]. These methods include standardized language proficiency tests, performance assessments, and communicative tasks, which collectively provide a comprehensive appraisal of learners' language abilities. Standardized tests offer a structured and impartial means of assessing language proficiency across diverse dimensions, while performance assessments and communicative tasks shed light on learners' practical language application and communicative prowess. By integrating these assessment strategies, educators and researchers gain a holistic comprehension of learners' language achievement and the efficacy of language instructional approaches [42].\n[2] conducted an experimental study aiming to assess whether EFL students taught through the PBLT approach would surpass those instructed using traditional ESL methodologies in speaking skills and its components. The study involved 34 students from a prominent Iranian university, majoring in engineering, sciences, and humanities. All students were at an intermediate language level before the experiment. Randomly assigned to the experimental (N = 17) and control (N = 17) groups, the former received PBLT-driven EFL instruction, while the latter received conventional ESL methodologies. Results indicated that the experimental group outperformed the control group in speaking skills and related components (range, fluency, coherence, content), excluding accuracy. The authors attributed the lack of a significant difference in accuracy to PBLT's emphasis on meaning, whereas accuracy primarily pertains to linguistic form.\nAnother study investigating the efficacy of PBLT in the EFL classroom was carried out by [3]. Employing the same participants as in [2], the authors utilized a pretest-posttest experimental design to examine the impact of PBLT on the development of EFL students' productive skills (speaking and writing) as well as their critical thinking abilities. Their findings demonstrated that PBLT plays a crucial role in fostering the productive skills of EFL students by creating a conducive environment for discussion and negotiation. Additionally, they assert that the environment facilitated by PBLT has the potential to boost EFL students' motivation and cultivate positive attitudes toward the approach.\nIn a more recent study, [43] demonstrated that implementing the PBLT approach in the EFL classroom has the potential to enhance students' speaking skills and their willingness to communicate. The authors of the same study suggest that the observed efficacy of PBLT in improving speaking skills and fostering a willingness to speak indicates that PBLT could serve as an alternative approach to the traditionally employed IRF (Initiation-Response-Feedback) approach in teaching speaking skills.\n[44] aimed to assess P4C's impact on the critical thinking and English-speaking skills of 7th-grade gifted EFL students in T\u00fcrkiye. Employing a mixed methods research design, the study included randomly assigned experimental and control groups. Quantitative data were gathered through the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT) X level and the Cambridge English Speaking Test (A2 level for Schools), while qualitative data were obtained from reflective diaries and evaluation forms. The control group followed standard SAC English-speaking lessons, while the experimental group received English-speaking lessons based on the P4C approach. While both groups showed an increase in English-speaking skills, the difference was not statistically significant. However, there was a notable increase in critical-thinking skills for the experimental group, which was statistically significant. Qualitative feedback from the experimental group indicated positive effects of P4C practices on critical thinking and English-speaking skills, though the impact on English-speaking skills was not statistically significant.\nEducational philosophy encompasses systematic ideas and concepts within the educational domain [45]. aimed to investigate the impact of educational philosophy, critical thinking, and classroom engagement on academic achievement among pre-service teachers, utilizing structural equation modeling [45]. involved 444 teacher pre-service volunteers from a Turkish state university. Data were collected through the Educational Belief Scale, UF/EM\u00c4\u00b0 Critical Thinking Disposition Instrument, and Classroom Engagement Inventory. The analysis revealed that the hypothesized model explained 22% of the variance in academic achievement. Path coefficients demonstrated significant relationships between certain educational philosophies and critical thinking dispositions. Moreover, innovativeness in critical thinking disposition was a significant predictor for all dimensions of classroom engagement.\nThe emphasis on student engagement has gained prominence in higher education due to its positive association with learning outcomes. Despite its acknowledged importance, there is limited research on pedagogical methods that effectively enhance this engagement. In [46], a classroom scenario involving 33 students at a Chinese university was examined to investigate their interaction with a pedagogical approach integrating automated, peer, and teacher feedback on academic writing. Through the analysis of multiple drafts, feedback sources, and retrospective interviews, the study found that the majority of students actively participated in this integrated approach, fostering behavioral, affective, and cognitive engagement and facilitating thoughtful revisions.\nAmid the global repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, online classes have garnered considerable attention. In language learning, the teacher-student relationship assumes a pivotal role, especially in online settings where student engagement holds paramount importance [47]. investigated the relationship between structured feedback and three types of engagement--cognitive, behavioral, and emotional--in an online class. The study encompassed 114 EFL third-year college students, and the results revealed positive and significant correlations between the utilization of structured feedback and all three types of engagement. The structured feedback, administered at the conclusion of each lesson, empowers students to articulate their knowledge, queries, and insights. This underscored the significance of effective feedback strategies in enhancing engagement within online language learning environments.\n[48] investigated the potential mediation of students' motivational beliefs in the association between teacher-student relationships and foreign language achievement. The study involved 1171 eighth graders in China. Results indicated a positive correlation between teacher-student relationships and foreign language achievement, with intrinsic and extrinsic motivation serving as partial mediators. Notably, intrinsic motivation played a more substantial mediating role compared to extrinsic motivation. In summary, nurturing teacher-student relationships can elevate learners' foreign language proficiency by cultivating motivation, with intrinsic motivation being particularly influential.\n[49] provided essential insights derived from a systematic literature review concentrating on the influence of teaching assistants or similar roles on pupils' academic performance. The review assessed measurements before and after teacher support interventions. The amalgamation of findings reveals that primary school students with identified learning difficulties, particularly in literacy, experience substantial academic improvement with targeted teacher support. However, studies involving more general teacher support, not specifically directed at pupils with identified difficulties, yield varied outcomes. This suggests that teacher support in mainstream classes may not universally enhance the academic achievements of all students.\nThe studies reviewed offer valuable insights into the efficacy of PBLT and related pedagogical approaches in enhancing language skills, critical thinking, and learner engagement [2] and [3]. demonstrate the superiority of PBLT over traditional ESL methodologies in fostering speaking skills, critical thinking, and learner motivation among EFL students, suggesting its potential as a transformative approach in language education. Similarly, [43] highlights the positive impact of PBLT on speaking skills and willingness to communicate, emphasizing its role as an alternative to conventional instructional methods. Additionally, [44] provides evidence of the effectiveness of P4C practices in enhancing critical thinking among EFL students, further underscoring the value of philosophy-driven methodologies in language instruction. These findings collectively contribute to the ongoing discourse on effective language teaching methodologies and underscore the importance of integrating philosophical inquiries into language education to promote holistic learner development.\nThe existing literature on PBLT has laid a strong foundation for the current study by highlighting the potential benefits of integrating philosophical inquiries into language instruction. Previous research has underscored the positive impact of PBLT on critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement among EFL learners. The research questions addressed in this study are crucial as they aim to provide empirical evidence to further substantiate these claims and offer insights into the specific mechanisms through which PBLT influences learners' cognitive and academic outcomes. By examining the effects of PBLT on critical thinking skills, learner engagement, and academic achievement, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on effective language teaching methodologies and informs educators and policymakers about the importance of incorporating philosophy-based approaches into language instruction.\nDespite the diverse landscape of language instruction approaches, such as CLT, CLIL, and more recently, PBLT, there exists a critical gap in the current literature regarding the specific impact of PBLT on critical thinking, learner engagement, and academic achievement among EFL learners. While existing studies acknowledge the efficacy of PBLT in enhancing speaking and writing skills, the literature lacks comprehensive investigations into its influence on critical thinking processes and overall engagement. The integration of philosophical questions and the establishment of a community of inquiry within PBLT have shown promise in fostering cognitive processes beyond linguistic contexts. Therefore, this study seeks to address this research gap and provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and challenges associated with the integration of PBLT in EFL classrooms, contributing to the ongoing discourse on effective language instruction strategies and their broader educational implications. The study aims to explore three key dimensions: the effect of PBLT on critical thinking skills, its impact on learner engagement, and its role in shaping overall academic achievement within the EFL context.\nMethod\nDesign\nThis study employed a concurrent mixed-methods research design, seeking to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of PBLT's impact on critical thinking, learner engagement, and academic achievement among EFL learners. The concurrent design involved the simultaneous collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data to offer a holistic perspective on the research questions. The quantitative phase utilized a teacher-made test to quantitatively measure PBLT's effect on academic achievement. Simultaneously, the qualitative phase employed interviews, focus group discussions, and reflective diaries to gather in-depth insights into participants' experiences and perceptions regarding the integration of PBLT. The concurrent mixed-methods approach ensured a robust exploration of the complex interplay between PBLT and the targeted outcomes, allowing for a comprehensive interpretation of the findings and enhancing the overall validity and reliability of the study.\nThe selection of a concurrent mixed-methods design for this study is justified by the need to comprehensively explore the multifaceted impact of PBLT on EFL learners. By combining both qualitative and quantitative approaches concurrently, this design allows for a more holistic understanding of the complex interplay between PBLT, critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement. While quantitative measures provide numerical data to assess academic outcomes, qualitative insights from interviews and document analysis offer nuanced perspectives on learners' experiences and cognitive processes. This integrated approach enhances the depth and richness of the study findings, providing a more robust foundation for informing language teaching practices and policymaking decisions.\nThe study was conducted in a university setting in Bangladesh, involving a total of 75 learners who were enrolled in intact classes. These learners were divided into two groups: an EG consisting of 38 learners and a CG with 37 learners with the same gender distribution. All participants were identified as intermediate EFL learners based on the results of the Oxford Quick Placement Test. The learners, aged between 18 and 26, shared Bengali as their native language and were learning English as their second language. Notably, none of the participants had prior experience visiting an English-speaking country before the commencement of the study. This homogeneous participant profile ensured consistency in language proficiency levels and background characteristics, contributing to the internal validity of the research findings. It is important to consider that in education settings, it is almost impossible to have a random selection of participants, therefore language researchers mostly resort to intact and preexisting classes [50]. However, it might also hamper the generalizability of the findings [50].\nThe selection criteria for participants in this study involved targeting EFL learners from similar educational backgrounds and language proficiency levels to ensure comparability between the experimental and control groups. Participants were recruited based on their enrollment in language courses that followed either a PBLT or traditional instructional approach. Additionally, efforts were made to ensure demographic diversity within the participant pool to enhance the generalizability of the findings.\nInstrument\nThe study employed a comprehensive set of instruments to measure various dimensions of learners' outcomes. Semi-structured interviews, adopted from [45, 47], were utilized to explore in-depth insights into learners' critical thinking and engagement. This qualitative approach allowed for a nuanced understanding of the participants' experiences and perspectives following the PBLT intervention.\nDocumentary analysis was conducted to complement the qualitative data, aiming to triangulate findings related to critical thinking and engagement. This involved the examination of relevant documents, records, or artifacts that could provide additional context and evidence of changes in learners' cognitive and participatory behaviors.\nTo assess language achievement, a teacher-made test (See Additional File 1) was administered, consisting of fill-in-the-blanks, multiple-choice, short-answer, and open-ended questions. The test's face and content validity were confirmed by two Ph.D. holders in Applied Linguistics, ensuring that the items effectively measured the intended constructs. Additionally, the construct validity was established through the known-group technique [50], further substantiating the test's ability to differentiate between groups with varying proficiency levels. To be more specific, we implemented the test a group of language teachers whose performance turned out to be significantly different from out participants at the outset of the study (p >.05), hence the construct validity of the instrument.\nReliability analysis was conducted using the KR-21 formula, resulting in a high-reliability coefficient (r =.823). This indicated consistency and dependability in the test scores, enhancing the robustness of the instrument for measuring language achievement. The careful validation and reliability procedures contribute to the overall trustworthiness and validity of the study's findings.\nData collection procedures\nIn this study, the EG received PBLT, while the CG received traditional language instruction. The PBLT sessions were designed to integrate philosophical questioning and the establishment of a community of inquiry within the EFL classroom.\nPBLT sessions were conducted over a specific timeframe, with each session lasting approximately 90 min. The EG, comprising 38 learners, participated in a total of 12 PBLT sessions conducted twice a week for six weeks. The sessions were facilitated by the instructor, emphasizing collaborative dialogue, exploration of philosophical questions, and engagement in critical thinking activities.\nIn PBLT, the instructor initiated discussions by posing open-ended philosophical questions relevant to the learners' language proficiency level. These questions were carefully crafted to stimulate higher-order thinking skills, encourage reflection, and prompt meaningful discourse. Learners actively engaged in discussions, sharing their perspectives, questioning assumptions, and collectively constructing knowledge within the community of inquiry.\nThe PBLT approach also involved collaborative activities, where learners worked together to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information related to the philosophical inquiries. The process aimed to extend learners' cognitive engagement beyond the immediate linguistic context, fostering a deeper understanding of language use in connection with critical thinking.\nThe PBLT sessions in the study were characterized by a dynamic and interactive learning environment that encouraged learners to engage deeply with language concepts through philosophical inquiries. Specific examples of philosophical questions used included queries about the nature of truth, the ethical implications of certain actions, and the meaning of identity. These questions prompted learners to critically analyze language usage in various contexts and consider multiple perspectives, fostering their critical thinking skills. Collaborative activities within the PBLT sessions involved group discussions, debates, and collaborative projects where learners worked together to explore language and philosophical concepts. For instance, learners might engage in a debate about the ethical implications of a hypothetical scenario or collaborate on a project to create a philosophical dialogue in the target language.\nConversely, the CG, consisting of 37 learners, received traditional language instruction, focusing on established methodologies without the incorporation of philosophical questioning or the community of inquiry approach. The traditional instruction encompassed language learning activities commonly found in conventional EFL classrooms, emphasizing grammar exercises, vocabulary drills, and communicative tasks.\nIn traditional language instruction for the control group, the focus was primarily on rote learning and mastering predefined language patterns. Learners engaged in activities such as grammar drills, vocabulary exercises, and structured dialogues aimed at practicing language forms and rules. Content typically revolved around textbook passages, dialogues, and exercises designed to reinforce grammar rules and vocabulary usage. Activities included completing fill-in-the-blank exercises, translating sentences, and practicing scripted dialogues. The instructional approach was teacher-centered, with the instructor delivering explanations, modeling language usage, and providing corrective feedback. Classroom interactions were often structured around the Initiation-Response-Feedback model, where the teacher posed questions, students responded, and the teacher provided feedback. Overall, the emphasis was on linguistic accuracy and mastery of prescribed language patterns, with limited opportunities for open-ended discussion, critical inquiry, or collaborative exploration of language concepts.\nBy contrasting the outcomes of the EG and CG, the study aimed to assess the specific impact of PBLT on critical thinking, engagement, and language achievement among EFL learners in the university setting. The careful design and implementation of PBLT sessions allowed for a focused examination of the innovative approach's efficacy in comparison to traditional language instruction methods.\nThe data collection procedures for this study involved a comprehensive approach, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods to gather information on critical thinking, engagement, and language achievement among the study participants.\nIndividual semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants from both the EG and the CG. These interviews aimed to explore learners' experiences, perceptions, and reflections on critical thinking and engagement after exposure to philosophy-based language teaching (PBLT). The interviews were audio-recorded with participants' consent and subsequently transcribed verbatim for qualitative analysis.\nA documentary analysis was conducted to complement the interview data. Relevant documents, such as written reflections, class notes, and artifacts, were collected from all participants in both the EG and CG. This additional source of data provided context and depth to the understanding of changes in critical thinking and engagement throughout the study.\nTo assess language achievement, a comprehensive teacher-made test was administered to all learners from both groups. The test included a variety of question types, such as fill-in-the-blanks, multiple-choice, short-answer, and open-ended questions. Administered under standardized conditions, the test allowed for the collection of responses for subsequent quantitative analysis.\nThe language achievement test underwent thorough validation and reliability procedures. Two Ph.D. holders in Applied Linguistics confirmed the face and content validity of the test. Construct validity was established through the known-group technique. The reliability of the test was measured using the KR-21 formula, resulting in a high-reliability coefficient (r =.823), indicating consistent and dependable measurement.\nThese data collection procedures adhered to ethical considerations, including obtaining informed consent, ensuring confidentiality, and providing opportunities for participants to seek clarification or ask questions. The triangulation of data from interviews, documentary analysis, and the language achievement test enhances the robustness and validity of the study's findings. Data triangulation enhances the trustworthiness and validity of the study's findings by corroborating results across multiple sources, methods, or perspectives. In this study, the use of semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and academic achievement assessments constitutes a triangulation approach. By collecting data through different methods, researchers can cross-validate findings, mitigate bias or limitations inherent in any single method, and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the research phenomenon. For example, insights gained from semi-structured interviews regarding participants' experiences and perceptions can be compared and complemented with findings from document analysis, which may offer objective evidence or contextual information. Similarly, triangulating qualitative data with quantitative measures of academic achievement allows for a more nuanced interpretation of outcomes. Overall, data triangulation strengthens the credibility and reliability of the study's conclusions by offering multiple lines of evidence and increasing confidence in the validity of the findings.\nData analysis procedures\nThe data analysis procedures involved a mixed-methods approach to comprehensively examine PBLT's effect on critical thinking, engagement, and language achievement among EFL learners. For the qualitative data obtained from semi-structured interviews and document analysis, thematic analysis was employed. Themes were derived manually through an iterative process involving the identification of recurring patterns and meaningful categories within the data. The coding process involved systematically assigning labels to segments of the data, creating a coding framework, and refining categories to capture the richness of participants' experiences and perceptions.\nTo assess the quantitative data related to language achievement, an independent-sample t-test was conducted. This statistical analysis was chosen due to the study's focus on comparing the performance of two distinct groups- the EG that underwent PBLT and the CG that received traditional language instruction. The t-test allowed for the examination of significant differences between the pretest and posttest scores of the two groups [51], providing insights into the effectiveness of PBLT in comparison to traditional instruction.\nBy employing both qualitative and quantitative analyses, the study aimed to triangulate findings, enhancing the overall validity and reliability of the research outcomes. The thematic analysis offered a nuanced understanding of participants' experiences, while the t-test provided statistical evidence to support or refute the hypotheses regarding the impact of PBLT on language achievement. The integration of these analyses allowed for a comprehensive and multifaceted exploration of the research questions, contributing to the depth and rigor of the study's findings.\nAs a learner exposed to PBLT, I found the experience to be incredibly enriching and thought-provoking. The incorporation of philosophical questions into language learning not only made the classes more engaging but also stimulated my critical thinking skills. Unlike traditional methods, PBLT encouraged us to explore diverse viewpoints, question assumptions, and engage in collaborative discussions. I felt more motivated to actively participate in class, and the interactive nature of PBLT created a dynamic learning environment. Overall, I believe PBLT has not only enhanced my language skills but has also equipped me with valuable critical thinking abilities that extend beyond the immediate context of language acquisition.\nAnother EG learner said:\nBeing part of the experimental group exposed to PBLT was a unique and intellectually stimulating experience. The emphasis on posing philosophical questions encouraged me to approach language learning in a more holistic way. I appreciated how PBLT prompted us to think deeply about language concepts and engage in meaningful discussions with fellow learners. The collaborative nature of the community of inquiry allowed me to hear diverse perspectives, which, in turn, improved my critical thinking skills. PBLT sessions were not just about language; they were about exploring ideas and constructing knowledge collectively. This approach has undoubtedly made my language learning journey more engaging and intellectually rewarding.\nHowever, CG learners had a dissimilar viewpoint. For instance, a CG learner said:\nWhere traditional instructional methods were employed, my experience was more conventional. While the classes were structured and covered essential language components, I observed a lack of emphasis on critical thinking. The focus seemed to be on rote learning and mastering predefined language patterns. While this approach may have helped me grasp certain language elements, I felt that it fell short in fostering a deeper understanding of language concepts and developing my critical thinking skills. The classes were more teacher-centered, and opportunities for collaborative exploration were limited. Looking back, I wonder if a more interactive and inquiry-based approach, like PBLT, could have added another dimension to my language learning experience.\nAnother CG participant thought that:\nMy language learning experience was traditional and, to some extent, predictable. The emphasis was primarily on textbook-based learning, and while I acquired language skills, I felt that the classes lacked a certain level of engagement. Critical thinking was not explicitly encouraged, and class activities were more focused on individual tasks rather than collaborative exploration. Reflecting on my experience, I can see how a more interactive and philosophy-infused approach, like the one described in the experimental group, might have injected more enthusiasm into my learning journey. There's a part of me that wishes I had the opportunity to experience PBLT to see how it could have shaped my language skills and critical thinking abilities differently.\nOne prominent theme that emerged from the interviews was the heightened awareness and application of critical thinking strategies among EFL learners who underwent PBLT. Participants expressed a more profound engagement with philosophical questions, emphasizing how these inquiries prompted them to question assumptions, consider alternative viewpoints, and articulate well-reasoned responses. This increased cognitive engagement was particularly evident in their reflections on how PBLT discussions encouraged them to delve deeper into the subject matter, going beyond surface-level understanding.\nFurthermore, the interviews shed light on the collaborative and dynamic nature of PBLT discussions, fostering an environment where learners actively participated in knowledge construction. Participants spoke of the interactive and dialogic nature of the PBLT sessions, where the exchange of questions and answers within the community of inquiry stimulated their critical thinking abilities. The thematic analysis highlighted the role of collaborative learning in enhancing critical thinking, as learners navigated through diverse perspectives and collectively addressed philosophical questions.\nOverall, the results of the semi-structured interviews consistently indicated that PBLT had a positive and meaningful effect on EFL learners' critical thinking skills. The thematic analysis provided rich insights into the ways in which PBLT contributed to the development of analytical, evaluative, and synthetic thinking among participants, emphasizing the potential of this approach to nurture a cohort of learners with enhanced cognitive abilities.\nThe document analysis of the materials produced during the PBLT sessions in the experimental group provided valuable insights into PBLT's effect on critical thinking. Through a thorough examination of learners' written reflections, class discussions, and collaborative projects, several recurring themes emerged.\nTheme 1: Depth of Reflection and Analysis One prominent theme identified in the document analysis was the depth of reflection and analysis demonstrated by learners in the experimental group. Learners engaged in written reflections that went beyond surface-level understanding, delving into the complexities of language concepts and philosophical inquiries. The incorporation of philosophical questions prompted learners to critically analyze language structures and meanings, fostering a more profound understanding of linguistic nuances.\nTheme 2: Divergent Thinking and Multiple Perspectives The document analysis revealed a consistent emphasis on divergent thinking and the exploration of multiple perspectives.

Learners highlighted their engagement in analyzing language structures within philosophical contexts, attributing this to the unique nature of PBLT. CG learners, while cognitively engaged, often associated their learning with memorization and adherence to prescribed language rules.\nResponses from two EG Learners\nSarah (EG Learner)\n\"I love how PBLT makes us think deeply about language. The philosophical questions push us to analyze language in ways I never thought of before. It's not just about memorizing rules; it's about understanding why language works the way it does. That's really motivating for me.\"\nAli (EG Learner)\n\"The PBLT sessions are like a breath of fresh air. We're not just passive learners; we're active participants in creating knowledge. I feel more connected to the language and my peers. It's not just about getting through the lesson; it's about exploring together.\"\nResponses from two CG learners\nMaryam (CG Learner)\n\"Traditional classes are okay, but sometimes it feels like we're going through the motions. I learn the rules, practice, and repeat. It's effective, but it's not as exciting as the PBLT stories I hear from my friends. I wish we had that kind of engagement.\"\nHassan (CG Learner)\n\"I think our classes are good, but it's more about the teacher telling us what to do. We follow the textbook, practice exercises, and that's it. It's a bit routine. I've heard PBLT is more dynamic, and I can see why some people might prefer that.\"\nIn summary, semi-structured interviews unveiled themes related to intrinsic motivation, collaborative learning, emotional engagement, cognitive involvement, and higher-order thinking in the EG. Responses from learners in the EG emphasized the transformative impact of PBLT on engagement, portraying it as a more dynamic and intellectually stimulating approach compared to the traditional instruction experienced by the CG.\nDocument analysis, focusing on various artifacts such as classroom observations, student reflections, and artifacts produced during PBLT sessions, provided nuanced insights into PBLT's impact on learners' engagement.\nThemes evident in the document analysis\nTheme 1: Active Participation and Dialogue Document analysis consistently revealed a prevalent theme of active participation and dialogue in PBLT sessions.

However, we first needed to ensure the data normality assumption. To this end, a one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test was run.\nTable 1:\nOne-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test\nAs indicated in Table 1, on both pre- and posttest, the data was normality distributed (p >.05).\nTable 2:\nGroup Statistics of Academic Achievement on the Pretest\nTable 2 shows that on the pretest, participants in the EG (N = 38, M = 3.368, SD = 1.617) performed similarly to the CG learners (N = 37, M = 3.054, SD = 1.526).\nTable 3:\nIndependent Samples Test of Academic Achievement on the Pretest\nThe results of the above-presented table (Table 3) show no significant difference between EG and CG participants on the pretest (F = 0.406, t = 0.0865, df = 73, p >.05).\nTable 4:\nGroup Statistics of Academic Achievement on the Posttest\nTable 4 demonstrates the superiority of EG's performance (N = 38, M = 10.657, SD = 4.911) to CG learners (N = 37, M = 3.648, SD = 1.813) on the posttest.\nTable 5:\nIndependent Samples Test of Academic Achievement on the Posttest\nBased on Table 5, the EG learners significantly outperformed their CG counterparts on the posttest (t = 8.239, df = 47.140, p =.001) with a huge effect size (effect size = 0.481).\nThe findings of this concurrent mixed-methods study underscore the transformative PBLT's impact on EFL learners' critical thinking skills, engagement, and academic achievement. The combination of semi-structured interviews and document analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted benefits associated with the PBLT approach in language teaching.\nThe semi-structured interviews revealed consistent themes across EG participants, highlighting a substantial positive impact on their critical thinking skills. Learners exposed to PBLT consistently reported improvements in their ability to analyze information critically, evaluate diverse perspectives, and synthesize complex ideas. The incorporation of philosophical questions into language learning not only enhanced engagement but also stimulated learners' critical thinking abilities. The collaborative and dynamic nature of PBLT discussions emerged as a key factor in fostering a more profound engagement with language concepts and philosophical inquiries.\nConversely, CG participants, exposed to traditional instructional methods, expressed a desire for a more interactive and inquiry-based approach akin to PBLT. Their reflections emphasized a perceived lack of emphasis on critical thinking in traditional classes, with a focus on rote learning and mastering predefined language patterns. This dichotomy in experiences suggests that PBLT provides a distinctive and enriching learning environment that extends beyond conventional language instruction.\nThematic analysis of both the interviews and document analysis highlighted the depth of reflection, divergent thinking, collaborative knowledge construction, integration of language and philosophy, and increased engagement and motivation as key outcomes of the PBLT approach. EG learners actively participated in discussions, generated meaningful artifacts, and demonstrated a profound engagement with philosophical questions. The blurring of boundaries between language instruction and critical thinking in PBLT showcases the potential for a symbiotic relationship, enriching learners' understanding of language.\nThe quantitative analysis of academic achievement confirmed that EG learners significantly outperformed their CG counterparts on the posttest, further substantiating the positive impact of PBLT. The substantial effect size indicates that the benefits of PBLT extend beyond qualitative improvements, influencing measurable academic outcomes.\nThese findings contribute significantly to the discourse on language teaching methodologies, emphasizing the value of incorporating philosophical inquiries into language instruction. PBLT not only enhances language skills but also cultivates critical thinking abilities, creating a dynamic and intellectually stimulating learning environment. The study suggests that educators should consider adopting PBLT or similar inquiry-based approaches to foster a holistic learning experience that goes beyond traditional language instruction.\nIn comparing our study's findings with the empirical background, several commonalities and distinctions emerge. Our investigation, employing a concurrent mixed-methods approach, shares similarities with [2] in revealing the positive impact of PBLT on critical thinking and engagement. Both studies underscore the broader cognitive benefits associated with alternative teaching methodologies, emphasizing enhanced productive language skills and motivation.\nA parallel observation can be drawn with [3] and [44], where critical thinking abilities are explored. Like our study, these investigations recognize the significance of fostering critical thinking through innovative teaching approaches. The emphasis on discussion and negotiation within PBLT aligns with findings suggesting that such environments contribute to a conducive learning atmosphere.\nMoreover, [43] and [47] provide additional parallels by emphasizing PBLT's potential as an alternative to traditional methods and its positive influence on speaking skills and willingness to communicate. This reinforces the notion that PBLT can offer distinct advantages in comparison to conventional instructional approaches.\nDespite these commonalities, differences emerge in the specific dimensions of language learning assessed. While [2] focuses on speaking skills components, our study primarily delves into critical thinking and engagement. Additionally, the nuanced exploration of PBLT's effects on willingness to communicate, as seen in [43], adds a dimension not directly addressed in our study.\nFurthermore, the comparison with the P4C approach in [44] contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of philosophy-based teaching approaches. This broader perspective enhances the discourse on the potential benefits of distinct philosophy-driven methodologies.\nMoreover, our study's contribution extends to a comprehensive examination of PBLT's impact on critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement. It complements existing literature by providing insights into varied dimensions affected by different teaching approaches.\nA noteworthy distinction between our study and the aforementioned research lies in our methodological approach. While all the preceding investigations adopted a quantitative research design, our study innovatively employed a concurrent mixed-methods approach. This methodological shift contributes a unique perspective, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between PBLT, critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement. By integrating qualitative insights through semi-structured interviews and document analysis alongside quantitative measures, our study offers a nuanced exploration of the multifaceted impacts of PBLT on EFL learners. This methodological novelty enhances the depth and richness of our findings, providing a more holistic view of the diverse dimensions influenced by alternative language teaching methodologies.\nOur empirical investigation aligns with the theoretical foundations of PBLT, critical thinking, and engagement, shedding light on the multifaceted dimensions of language learning. In the realm of PBLT, our study resonates with Vygotsky's premise that language serves as a mediated tool for elevated thinking skills. By fostering dialogic question-and-answer interactions, our findings underscore the transformative potential of PBLT in engaging learners in exploratory talk and knowledge discovery. Similarly, our emphasis on small 'p' philosophy aligns with the paradigm proposed by previous scholars, aiming to cultivate critical perspectives and challenge assumed truths.\nRegarding critical thinking, our study aligns with influential frameworks like Bloom's Taxonomy and the Paul-Elder Critical Thinking Framework. Our findings consistently reveal the positive impact of PBLT on learners' critical thinking skills, emphasizing higher-order cognitive processes such as analysis, evaluation, and synthesis. The Socratic influence on our approach echoes the longstanding philosophical tradition entwined with critical thinking, emphasizing questioning, dialogue, and reflective inquiry to stimulate intellectual growth.\nIn the domain of engagement, our study contributes to the conceptual understanding outlined by Fredricks, Blumenfeld, and Paris. Our exploration of engagement encompasses behavioral, emotional, and cognitive dimensions, reflecting the comprehensive model proposed by these scholars. By investigating the reciprocal relationship between teacher behavior and student engagement, our study aligns with Skinner and Belmont's perspective, highlighting the role of educators in shaping an environment conducive to sustained learner involvement. Additionally, our consideration of the broader school climate and the impact of extracurricular activities resonates with the extended scope of engagement identified by Mahoney, Cairns, and Farmer.\nCrucially, our study introduces a methodological novelty by employing a concurrent mixed-methods approach, distinguishing it from previous quantitative-focused investigations. This methodological shift allows for a more holistic exploration of the interplay between PBLT, critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement, providing nuanced insights into the complex dynamics of language learning. In essence, our study not only aligns with but extends the theoretical foundations, contributing empirical evidence to the discourse on effective language teaching methodologies, critical thinking development, and learner engagement in EFL contexts.\nThe study has multiple implications. For language teachers, our study offers valuable implications by highlighting the effectiveness of philosophy-based language teaching PBLT in enhancing critical thinking and engagement among EFL learners. Teachers can incorporate PBLT strategies into their classrooms, encouraging dialogic interactions and philosophical questioning to stimulate higher-order cognitive processes. This approach not only enriches language learning but also cultivates a more dynamic and intellectually stimulating classroom environment. Language teachers are encouraged to adopt a facilitative role, guiding learners in exploring diverse perspectives and collaboratively constructing knowledge. The findings emphasize the importance of creating opportunities for interactive and reflective discourse, empowering teachers to play a pivotal role in nurturing critical thinking skills.\nMaterials developers can draw inspiration from our study to design materials that integrate philosophical inquiries into language learning resources. By infusing language instruction with philosophical content, materials can be developed to foster a deeper understanding of language concepts and encourage learners to question assumptions. This approach contributes to the creation of engaging and thought-provoking learning materials that go beyond traditional language instruction. Materials developers are encouraged to design resources that promote active participation, collaboration, and the exploration of multiple perspectives, aligning with the principles of PBLT. Integrating philosophical themes into language materials can enhance the overall learning experience and contribute to the holistic development of EFL learners.\nSyllabus designers can rethink and adapt their curricula to incorporate elements of PBLT, recognizing its potential to enhance critical thinking skills and learner engagement. Our study suggests that a more inquiry-based and collaborative approach, inspired by philosophy, can be integrated into existing language curricula. Syllabus designers may consider creating spaces for dialogic interactions, community of inquiry activities, and opportunities for learners to explore language within broader philosophical contexts. This shift in syllabus design encourages a more holistic view of language learning, emphasizing the interconnectedness of language instruction with critical thinking development.\nPolicy-makers in the field of education can consider the implications of our study when formulating guidelines and recommendations for language teaching methodologies. The positive impact of PBLT on critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement suggests the potential benefits of incorporating such approaches into broader educational policies. Policy initiatives may focus on providing professional development opportunities for teachers to integrate PBLT strategies, allocating resources for the development of materials aligned with philosophical inquiries, and encouraging a pedagogical shift towards more interactive and collaborative language learning environments. Our findings provide a basis for policy-makers to explore innovative and research-based approaches to language education, fostering a culture of critical thinking and active engagement among EFL learners.\nIn conclusion, our study delved into the realm of language education, exploring the transformative PBLT's impact on critical thinking and learner engagement among EFL students. The findings underscored the significant positive effects of PBLT, revealing its potential to not only enhance language skills but also foster a deeper level of cognitive engagement. Through a mixed-methods approach, combining semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and academic achievement assessments, our investigation provided nuanced insights into the multifaceted dimensions of PBLT.\nThe empirical evidence gleaned from semi-structured interviews with participants from both experimental and control groups illuminated the distinct advantages of PBLT in cultivating critical thinking skills. Learners exposed to PBLT reported a heightened ability to analyze information critically, consider diverse perspectives, and synthesize complex ideas. The contrast with control group responses highlighted the limitations of traditional instructional methods in promoting similar cognitive outcomes. Notably, the emergence of themes such as increased engagement, collaborative knowledge construction, and the integration of language and philosophy further reinforced the efficacy of PBLT in enriching the learning experience.\nDocument analysis of materials produced during PBLT sessions provided a comprehensive view of the approach's impact on critical thinking. Themes such as the depth of reflection and analysis, divergent thinking, collaborative knowledge construction, integration of language and philosophy, and increased engagement collectively painted a vivid picture of the dynamic and intellectually stimulating learning environment created by PBLT. These themes underscored the transformative potential of PBLT, transcending traditional language instruction and promoting a holistic development of learners' cognitive abilities.\nThe assessment of academic achievement revealed that learners in the experimental group significantly outperformed their counterparts in the control group. This quantitative aspect reaffirmed the positive impact of PBLT on language proficiency, adding an empirical dimension to the qualitative insights gathered through interviews and document analysis. The statistically significant difference in posttest scores suggested that PBLT not only enhances critical thinking but also contributes to measurable academic advancements.\nIn relation to existing literature, our study adds a distinctive contribution by employing a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies. While previous studies primarily focused on quantitative assessments, our research enriched the understanding of the subject matter by incorporating qualitative insights through interviews and document analysis. This novel approach provided a more comprehensive exploration of the impact of PBLT on critical thinking and engagement among EFL learners.\nThe implications of our findings extend to language teachers, materials developers, syllabus designers, and policy-makers. Language teachers are encouraged to embrace PBLT strategies, fostering dialogic interactions and philosophical questioning to enhance critical thinking skills. Materials developers can draw inspiration from our study to design engaging resources that integrate philosophical content into language learning. Syllabus designers may consider adapting curricula to incorporate PBLT elements, recognizing its potential benefits. Policy-makers can explore innovative approaches to language education, informed by the positive outcomes of PBLT, to foster a culture of critical thinking and active engagement.\nIn essence, our study not only illuminates the effectiveness of PBLT in enhancing critical thinking and engagement among EFL learners but also provides a methodological contribution through the application of a mixed-methods approach. As we navigate the evolving landscape of language education, the insights gained from this research open avenues for further exploration and innovation in pedagogical practices, paving the way for a more holistic and intellectually stimulating language learning experience.\nWhile our study contributes valuable insights into PBLT's impact on critical thinking and learner engagement among EFL students, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations that temper the generalizability of our findings.\nFirstly, the study's scope is limited to a specific context and participant demographic, focusing on a particular group of EFL students in a defined educational setting. Consequently, the generalizability of the findings to diverse learner populations, linguistic contexts, or educational levels may be restricted. Future research should aim to replicate the study across different contexts to assess the robustness and universality of the observed effects.\nSecondly, the duration of the intervention in our study was relatively short-term, and the impact of PBLT was assessed immediately post-implementation. A more longitudinal investigation could provide deeper insights into the sustainability of the observed enhancements in critical thinking and engagement. Long-term studies tracking participants over an extended period would offer a nuanced understanding of the enduring effects of PBLT on language proficiency and cognitive development. Acknowledging the short-term nature of the study and advocating for more longitudinal investigations is essential for comprehensively understanding the sustainability of PBLT effects on critical thinking and engagement. While the current study provides valuable insights into the immediate impact of PBLT, longitudinal investigations would offer a deeper understanding of how these effects evolve over time and whether they are sustained beyond the duration of the intervention. Long-term studies could track participants' progress and development over extended periods, allowing researchers to assess the durability of any observed enhancements in critical thinking skills and learner engagement. Moreover, longitudinal investigations would elucidate whether the benefits of PBLT persist as learners encounter increasingly complex language tasks and real-world communication scenarios. By examining the long-term trajectory of PBLT effects, researchers can determine whether any initial gains in critical thinking and engagement translate into enduring cognitive habits and attitudes toward language learning. This longitudinal perspective is crucial for informing educational practices and policy decisions, as it provides insights into the long-term effectiveness and viability of PBLT as a pedagogical approach in EFL contexts.\nThirdly, the qualitative aspects of the study, particularly the semi-structured interviews and document analysis, rely on subjective interpretations. While efforts were made to ensure rigor in data analysis, the inherently subjective nature of qualitative research introduces the possibility of interpretation bias. Future research could incorporate additional quantitative measures to triangulate findings and enhance the robustness of the study.\nMoreover, the study primarily focused on the impact of PBLT on critical thinking and engagement, leaving room for exploring other potential outcomes and variables. Future investigations could delve into the affective domain, considering variables such as motivation, self-efficacy, and learner attitudes toward language learning within the PBLT framework.\nSuggestions for further research include conducting comparative studies between different pedagogical approaches, such as traditional methods versus PBLT, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relative effectiveness of these strategies. Additionally, investigating the adaptability of PBLT across various proficiency levels, languages, and cultural contexts would contribute to a more nuanced understanding of its applicability. Conducting comparative studies between different pedagogical approaches, proficiency levels, languages, and cultural contexts is imperative for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the relative effectiveness and adaptability of PBLT. By comparing PBLT with traditional instructional methods across diverse contexts, researchers can discern the specific conditions under which PBLT yields optimal outcomes and identify potential limitations or challenges. Additionally, investigating the effectiveness of PBLT at various proficiency levels and in different languages enables researchers to assess its generalizability and applicability across a broader spectrum of learners. Comparative studies also offer insights into the cultural nuances that may influence the implementation and reception of PBLT, informing culturally responsive instructional practices. Furthermore, examining PBLT in comparison to other philosophy-based approaches or alternative teaching methodologies elucidates its unique contributions and advantages. By systematically comparing PBLT with alternative approaches, researchers can identify best practices and tailor instructional strategies to meet the diverse needs of learners in different educational contexts. Overall, comparative studies provide valuable insights into the nuanced dynamics of language teaching and learning, guiding educators and policymakers in making informed decisions about the adoption and adaptation of PBLT to enhance language education worldwide.\nFurthermore, exploring the role of teacher training and professional development in implementing PBLT is an avenue for future research. Investigating how educators can be effectively-prepared to integrate philosophy-based approaches into language instruction would contribute valuable insights to teacher education programs. Well-prepared educators can play a pivotal role in the successful integration of philosophy-based approaches into language instruction. Their thorough understanding of both pedagogical principles and philosophical concepts can enable them to create a conducive learning environment that fosters critical thinking and engagement. Equipped with effective teaching strategies, such as facilitating dialogic interactions and guiding philosophical inquiries, educators can effectively implement PBLT to enhance learners' cognitive and academic outcomes. Furthermore, their ongoing professional development could ensure continuous refinement of instructional practices, thereby maximizing the potential impact of philosophy-based approaches on language learning.\nIn conclusion, while our study illuminates the positive impact of PBLT on critical thinking and engagement, recognizing its limitations opens doors for further exploration. Future research endeavors can address these limitations and extend the knowledge base, ultimately contributing to the ongoing evolution of effective language teaching methodologies.\nTo sum the conclusion up, the study revealed significant outcomes across critical thinking, engagement, and academic achievement. Through a concurrent mixed-methods approach, it was found that PBLT positively influences learners' critical thinking skills, fostering abilities in analysis, evaluation, and synthesis. Moreover, learners exposed to PBLT demonstrated increased engagement, manifested through active participation and collaborative knowledge construction. Additionally, quantitative analysis confirmed that PBLT significantly improved academic achievement, as evidenced by higher posttest scores compared to traditional instruction methods. These findings underscore the transformative potential of PBLT in enhancing both cognitive and academic outcomes in EFL contexts.\nAcknowledgements: Not Applicable.\nCorrespondence:\nAuthor details: 1 https://ror.org/04azbjn80, grid.411851.8, 0000 0001 0040 0205, School of Maxism, Guangdong University of Technology, , 510520, Guangzhou, China. 2 https://ror.org/04jt46d36, grid.449553.a, 0000 0004 0441 5588, Department of English Language, College of Sciences and Humanities, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, , Al-kharj, Saudi Arabia. 3 https://ror.org/041sz8d87, grid.11567.34, 0000 0001 2207 0761, Mediterranea International Centre for Human Rights Research, Mediterranea University of Reggio Calabria, , Reggio Calabria, Italy. 4 https://ror.org/05wv2vq37, grid.8198.8, 0000 0001 1498 6059, Department of English, University of Dhaka, , Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n9.

        "methodology": "Many students feel uncomfortable when obliged to communicate in English. Students' fear of speaking English is influenced by psychological reasons such as the fear of failing, being misunderstood, and making grammatical errors. Students' active participation in English class discussions might be hindered by shyness, nervousness, lack of confidence, and motivation. Helping these reserved students gain self-assurance and perfect their spoken English is a top priority for all English language instructors. In the classroom, teachers may use some simple methods to encourage their reserved students to open up and speak English with more ease and confidence. The existing literature on students' shyness shows that the gap in this realm is great and a critical look is needed. To this end, the current research intended to gauge the effects of self-esteem, teacher support, and critical thinking on anxiety and shyness in language classes. 385 language learners attending English language institutions took part in this research. They were at intermediate and upper intermediate levels. The findings of both confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) point to the fact that improving students' self-esteem, teacher support, and critical thinking may have a moderating effect on students 'anxiety and shyness in language learning. The implications of this inquiry may be advantageous for language learners, language instructors, as well as policymakers.\nKeywords: Self-esteem, Teacher support, Critical thinking, Anxiety, Shyness, EFL learners\nAuthor(s): Lei Li1 and Tahereh Heydarnejad2\nOverview\nThroughout the process of their academic journey, multiple learners have encountered some adverse events that might potentially impede their progress in acquiring a foreign language. Language learners may find speaking and writing to be more demanding and tough since they need to use their skills to produce spoken or written communications. Over the years, there have been several improvements in the techniques and methods used to teach speaking and writing in order to make the learning process simpler. As a result, despite numerous obstacles, some students are able to overcome them and persevere in their attempts to learn and utilize a second language. However, some students may struggle to overcome hurdles, perhaps leading to the development of foreign language anxiety (FLA). FLA is a condition that is marked by the experiencing of negative emotions, such as unease, anxiety, and nervousness, when engaging in tasks such as listening, writing, reading, and speaking in a language that is not one's native tongue.\nAccording to the definition provided by [1], anxiety refers to a phenomenon that is peculiar to a particular setting, when a person has a negative evaluation of their own communication skills within the framework of language acquisition. The research conducted by [2, 3] suggests that anxiety in language learning may be categorized into three different components. The aforementioned components include communication apprehension, exam anxiety, and the concern of receiving poor evaluations. The concept of \"communication apprehension\" pertains to the anxiety experienced by pupils while interacting with people or encountering challenges in comprehending auditory information. The subsequent element of anxiety in the context of language acquisition is often referred to as test anxiety, which manifests when students have apprehension around their anticipated performance on an examination.\nAn EFL student who suffers from a phobia of negative assessment is one who intentionally avoids circumstances that have the potential to result in the formation of unfavorable judgments in the perceptions of other people, and who is uncomfortable with the perspectives that are held by other people. Similar research by [3] found that students' personality traits (introversion vs. extroversion) significantly impact the degree to which they worry about failing their foreign language classes. In accordance with [4], students' anxiety affects their classroom performance in ways that contribute to their development and progression. The Attentional Control Theory (ACT) offers an explanation for anxiety and its negative consequences, as proposed by [5]. Anxious students, according to the ACT, report high levels of worry and low levels of self-confidence, both of which are associated with poor outcomes [6, 7].\nThe consequences of skill-based anxiety in second/foreign language learning have also been studied in recent studies. The studies looked at many forms of communication anxiety, such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing [8, 9]. Research results presented previously indicate that students' lack of motivation and poor performance may be traced back to their fear of public speaking, writing, reading, and listening. Recent research by [10, 11] found that students' ability to feel academically buoyant and control their emotions helped them deal with their nervousness during language learning.\nShyness is considered to be one of the personality traits that might contribute to anxiety while speaking a foreign language. This is mostly due to the fact that shyness tends to be more evident in social situations that include communication, particularly when people are speaking a language that is not their native tongue. In the words of [12], a shy person is typically fearful, has a tendency to talk less, and experiences uncomfortable feelings when communicating with others or when in unfamiliar situations. [13] defined two forms of shyness: frightened shyness and self-conscious shyness. As described by [14, 15], terrified shyness is a sort of shyness that emerges when a person interacts with other individuals. The person's knowledge that he or she is an integral part of a community that has the ability to assess the individual is a cause of the second sort of shyness.\nDiverse constructs attributable to the learner can assist students in reducing potential shyness and anxiety in language classes and ensuring their well-being. The construct of self-esteem, which has been extensively investigated within the field of education, pertains to an individual's subjective evaluation of their own worth or value [16]. Possessing elevated self-esteem is crucial for fostering healthy mental health and overall well-being. Having a high level of self-esteem is beneficial as it enables individuals to cultivate effective coping mechanisms, effectively navigate through challenging situations, and have a balanced viewpoint towards adverse experiences [17]. The classification of self-esteem is based on three levels: expanded, substantial, and inadequate self-esteem [18]. People with elevated self-esteem consistently see themselves as superior to others and engage in the practice of diminishing the capabilities of others. However, those who possess a high level of self-esteem tend to have a propensity for self-love and self-acceptance via placing faith in their own capabilities. On the contrary, those characterized by a diminished degree of se lack confidence in their own talents and exhibit doubt over their capacity to successfully complete a given activity.\nThe significance of self-esteem in EFL settings is highly emphasized owing to the distinctive characteristics of L2 education, as highlighted by [19]. According to [20], self-esteem refers to an individual's belief in their own abilities and worth. [21] suggest that the construct being examined is derived from an individual's subjective evaluations of their own talents, competencies, and social relationships. In the words of [22], self-esteem is closely connected to the process of self-evaluation, which encompasses cognitive evaluations that play a vital role in an individual's perception of their own value and mental well-being. Following its establishment within the existing body of literature on the interplay between psycho-emotional factors and EFL settings, numerous studies have been undertaken to explore the relationship between self-esteem, optimistic feelings, academic drive, nervousness, accomplishment, retention, adaptability, and related variables [21].\nIn addition, EFL scholars have gone a step further over the past decade to investigate how students' confidence affects their language skills and academic outcomes in areas like oral communication, written expression, reading comprehension, and listening [23]. In a similar line of inquiry, [24] reached the conclusion that structural elicitation plays a mediating role in the process of developing advanced and intermediate language learners' speaking skills. The results of the research showed that students of another language who were able to demonstrate greater levels of self-esteem fared better on oral examinations when they were given in mixed groups. Evidence was discovered by [25, 26] to support the hypothesis that teachers who demonstrate good social and emotional skills to their students play an essential role in the students' personal growth in these areas.\nTeacher support (TS) can also be critical in learners' mental and psychological success. TS includes educators' empathy, compassion, commitment, reliability, and warmth for their pupils [27]. On the basis of Tardy's [28] social support paradigm, the wide viewpoint defines TS as the act of a teacher providing informational, instrumental, emotional, or appraisal assistance to a student, regardless of the setting in which the student is located. Supportive instructors respect and are passionate about in developing personal ties with their students, and they may provide aid, assistance, and guidance to pupils in need [29]. Effective assistance from the instructor is probably to make students feel comfortable and inspired, which will motivate them to put extra work into the course of study, become more involved in educational endeavors, and accomplish greater educational results [30]. TS is a complex concept that has been interpreted in a variety of ways. There are three components of TS that are central to the self-determination approach: encouragement of self-determination, commitment for engagement, and encouragement for regulation [31]. TS for their pupils may be broken down into four categories from an interpersonal standpoint: informative, essential, scrutiny, and emotional [32].\nResearch findings have indicated a significant positive relationship between TS and various dimensions of student engagement, including behavioral, cognitive, and emotional aspects. Furthermore, it should be noted that teacher support has the potential to indirectly impact students' academic engagement by fostering good accomplishment emotions and mitigating negative success emotions [27, 31]. Previous research has mostly focused on investigating teacher assistance in the context of general education [32], with minimal emphasis placed on its impact on students' acquisition of a second language. Furthermore, it should be noted that teacher support has the potential to indirectly impact students' academic engagement by fostering good accomplishment emotions and mitigating negative success emotions [33].\nPrevious research has mostly focused on investigating teacher assistance in the context of general education [32], with minimal emphasis placed on its impact on students' acquisition of a second language. The significance of the teacher as a crucial source of positive reinforcement for learners in language courses has been recognized through the interpersonal character of language instruction and frequent communication between teachers and students [33]. Therefore, it is imperative to delve deeper into the exploration of teacher support as a fundamental factor associated with teachers [34].\nAs described by [35], CT is a process of continually assessing hypotheses in order to draw inferences about the world. [36] uses the phrase \"reflective practices\" to define critical thinking, which establishes a logical bridge between initial assumptions and well-grounded conclusions. The American Philosophical Association offers a definitive definition of CT by describing it as the process of making informed, self-controlled decisions by the use of evidence, reasoning, and logic [37]. Despite the fact that there is no universally accepted definition of CT, a large amount of research demonstrates the importance of CT in many walks of life, notably in accomplishing academic goals [38, 39]. Students are in need to have an understanding of how to employ CT techniques in the classroom in order to learn, as [40] argued.\nMoreover, [41] highlighted the central importance of CT in this debate by highlighting its ability to transform inactive participants into active questioners. Teachers, as the, are accountable for teaching and practicing deep understanding, yet CT is not a natural talent [42]. With these considerations in mind, the study of critical thinking and its beneficial impacts on academic success in EFL contexts (among many others) is a fruitful area in which to engage in educational inquiry. [43], for example, have examined the value of creating a model for instructing critical thinking in the EFL classroom. They came to the conclusion that students who are able to think critically are better equipped to develop their own methods of reflective learning. According to the findings of another research by [44], if EFL instructors acquire sufficient understanding about critical thinking, they will be able to use it in their own classes. Comparable reasons for the failure to properly deploy CT in EFL classrooms were cited by [39, 44], who pointed to EFL instructors' limited comprehension of CT and the discrepancy between teachers' positive sentiments regarding CT and their actual classroom actions.\nWith these considerations in mind, the study of critical thinking and its beneficial impacts on academic success in EFL contexts (among many others) is a fruitful area in which to engage in educational inquiry.

Comparable reasons for the failure to properly deploy CT in EFL classrooms were cited by [47], who pointed to EFL instructors' limited comprehension of CT and the discrepancy between teachers' positive sentiments regarding CT and their actual classroom actions. Literature reviews reveal that students experience CT in various ways. CT also has a considerable impact on how students form their sense of self [48]. Moreover, [49] found that using CT enhanced both reading comprehension and language acquisition. EFL students with higher CT scores performed better in writing tasks, as shown by [50]. It was also concluded that CT boosted students' ability to learn via exploration [51-53].\nThis study\nGiven the substantial impact of the constructs mentioned above in facilitating the acquisition of a foreign language, as well as the limited amount of research investigating their interconnections, the main aim of this study was to investigate the influence of self-esteem, TS, and CT on reducing shyness and anxiety in the context of English as a Foreign Language in Iran. Drawing upon relevant academic literature and theoretical frameworks, a conceptual framework was developed to visually represent the dynamic interplay of the aforementioned elements. The proposed model (Fig. 1) was next subjected to CFA and SEM, which are both extensively used statistical methods for evaluating the construct validity of latent variables and the relationships among multiple variables, respectively. In order to accomplish the goals of the study, the researchers developed the following research inquiries:\nRQ1\nTo what extent does the development of self-esteem skills among EFL learners help to the reduction of shyness and anxiety?\nRQ2\nTo what extent does the development of teacher support among EFL learners help to the reduction of shyness and anxiety?\nRQ3\nTo what extent does the development of critical thinking skills among EFL learners help to the reduction of shyness and anxiety?\nIn light of the aforementioned research inquiries, the subsequent null hypotheses were put forth:\nHO1\nThe development of self-esteem skills among EFL learners does not help to the reduction of shyness and anxiety.\nHO2\nThe development of teacher support among EFL learners does not help to the reduction of shyness and anxiety.\nHO3\nThe development of critical thinking among EFL learners does not help to the reduction of shyness and anxiety.\nFig. 1:\nThe suggested model\nMethodology\nContext and participants\nThere was a total of 385 students who took part in the study, with men making up 33% of the group and women the other 68.47%. All respondents were Iranian pursuing English learning in private language institutions (Mashhad, northeast of Iran); their ages varied from 16 to 19 with a median of 17. The survey was conducted in English since respondents were proficient enough in the language (upper and intermediate levels) to answer questions in the intended language. Those who were interested in taking part completed an electronic permission form and sent it to the study's organizers. The researchers made it very apparent that taking part in the study was entirely optional and that individuals might stop participating at any moment. Researchers also promised participants that their comments would be kept secret and that they would be updated on the study's findings. It is worth mentioning that the studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Review Committee at Private Language Institutions in Mashhad (Approval No. 29/213,087/2 M).\nInstruments\nThe Foreign Language Learning Self-esteem Scale (FLLSE) was used in order to investigate the levels of self-esteem held by university students studying EFL. Using a Likert scale with five points, this tool was designed by [18]. The scale ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The FLLSE is comprised of a total of 25 questions, which are broken down into four categories: (1) language competence (e.g., \"I possess a high level of comprehension in the English language.\"), (2) actual in-class language use (e.g., \"I am available to participate in any English classroom activities as a volunteer.\"), (3) in-class correlations (e.g., \"I participate in English classroom activities with reluctance.\"), and (4) attitude toward behavior (e.g., \"I am not well-liked by my English classmates.\"). In this particular investigation, the dependability of this instrument was evaluated, and the result of the Cronbach alpha coefficient was found to be satisfactory ([alpha] = 0.851).\nIn order to conduct an evaluation of teacher support, [26], Teacher Support Measure (TSM) with two subsections was used. These subsections included four items each for teacher academic support and teacher personal support. On a Likert scale of five points, each item was given a score ranging from 1 (always) to 5 (never). For the purpose of evaluating subject-specific teacher assistance, these questions have been revised with the addition of the word \"English.\" Cronbach's alpha indicated that the reliability of this scale was satisfactory (with scores ranging from 0.811 to 0.892.\nCT was evaluated using the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal Form A (WGCTAF) by [54], who were studying university students' CT. This measure is broken up into five categories: inference, identifying assumptions, making deductions, interpretation, and assessment. Each category has a total of 32 questions. Cronbach's alpha was determined to be adequate in this investigation ([alpha] = 0.865), as reported.\nTo determine the degree of shyness among the participants the McCroskey Shyness Scale (MSS) [55] was applied. The participants were asked to rate how much they agreed or disagreed with each of 14 statements (e.g., I keep thinking that the other students are better at languages than I am.) on a 5-point scale, with 1 being a strong disagreement and 5 representing a strong agreement. The study's results were corroborated by Cronbach's alpha, which suggested that the reliability of this scale was good ([alpha] = 0.876).\nThe Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS), which was developed and validated by [2], was used in an investigation of the degree to which university students suffer anxiety when studying a foreign language. The 33 questions on this scale, which uses a Likert scale with five points (range from strongly agree to strongly disagree), were chosen to evaluate communication anxiety, fear of unfavorable evaluation, exam anxiety, and anxiety associated with learning a foreign language. Cronbach's alpha indicated that the reliability of the FLCAS was satisfactory (with scores ranging from 0.833 to 0.862), and this was supported by the findings of the study.\nData collection and analysis\nIn 2023, researchers conducted the data collection procedure. Online forms (specifically Google Forms) were used to collect the data. This online survey has five sections: the FLLSE, TSM, WGCTAF, MSS, and FLCAS. As a result of the fact that the participants had the requisite qualifications to respond to the text in English, the scales were written in the target language, and translation was not required. Due to the rigorous preparation of the computerized survey, there would have been little likelihood of any data being lost. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was first used to look at the data distribution. Data screening confirmed the normality of the data, demonstrating the reliability of parametric methods. Given the assumption of normal distribution in the data, CFA and SEM were conducted using LISREL 8.80. CFA is a statistical method used to validate the component structure of a given collection of observed data. Additionally, CFA enables researchers to examine if there is a connection between observable variables and the latent constructs that underlie them [56, 57].\nIn order to ensure that self-esteem, TS, and CT are successfully implemented, it is imperative that professors and other instructors at schools, universities, and private institutions take an active role in the development and upkeep of an atmosphere that is receptive to such an endeavor. They are required to learn the information essential to cultivate self-esteem, TS, and CT inside their respective courses. EFL teachers can get these strategies from courses taken both during training and prior to employment. Moreover, it is crucial to include actionable techniques for cultivating and implementing self-esteem, TS, and CT within the context of EFL instruction. In order to give sufficient opportunities for learners to gain the necessary skills and to grantee the whole education and society, appropriate activities and materials should be designed. An effective method of providing support to EFL students is by promoting the development of a growth mindset. This will aid learners in discovering a clear and meaningful objective, while also strengthening their feeling of inclusion and connection. The individuals will have both immediate and enduring objectives to strive for, and each accomplishment will be seen as a significant triumph.\nStudents are expected to advance toward a condition in which the application of appropriate procedures will become natural, and the capabilities of learning will grow into an intuitive form, via the completion of a range of tasks in the classroom. It was highly suggested that those charged with building educational curriculum, developing educational policy, and generating new materials take into consideration the important impacts of self-esteem and CT when they are creating new materials and tasks. EFL students at schools, institutions, and universities may, in addition to other types of academic work, participate in activities that put practical ways for increasing the impacts of self-esteem and CT into practice. These activities may include things like simulations, role-playing games, discovery learning activities, and oral presentations. The provision of additional open conversation channels with the subject matter of self-esteem, TS, and CT, as well as the management of shyness and anxiety at the upper intermediate level, may be an additional beneficial chance to strengthen these abilities and practice their language.\nBased on the findings of this study, EFL educators are urged to redesign their curricula and create assessments with the students' needs in mind. Encouraging students to take an active part in their own education, as well as directing and improving the development of self-help structures, may improve the quality of teaching and assessment in any educational setting. Increasing their proficiency in digital media is a priority for both students and teachers. With this knowledge in hand, both students and teachers may feel secure throughout language instruction and assessment.\nThe present research, similar to earlier investigations, has numerous limitations: (1) This investigation was carried out using quantitative analytic methods. Using mixed-method approaches provides for a more in-depth look, and they are avenues that may be pursued for future study. (2) As previously stated, it is critical for EFL teachers to play a role in the development of self-esteem, CT, and other self-aid constructs in their pupils. This element was not taken into consideration throughout our study. Further research may be able to investigate how teachers' own levels of self-esteem and CT impact students' self-esteem and CT. (3) The learners' diverse backgrounds, as well as their demographic data, were not taken into consideration in this study. These difficulties may be addressed in future study, and it may be studied to what extent differences in sociocultural environment and demographic information may have an influence on the nature of the link between self-esteem, TS, CT, shyness, and anxiety. (4) Inclusion of students from other faculties and institutions would aid in gaining an overview of the outcomes. This inquiry may be carried out in diverse educational situations, including as schools and private language institutions, in the course of future research. (5) In future research, possible investigators may choose to focus on the relationship between self-esteem, TS, CT, shyness, anxiety and other learner-ascribed traits including buoyancy, grit tendencies, readiness to speak, and identity construction/reconstruction.\nAbbreviations: EFL: English as a Foreign Language; CFA: Confirmatory Factor Analysis; SEM: Structural Equation Modeling; FLA: Foreign Language Anxiety; ACT: Attentional Control Theory; TS: Teacher Support; CT: Critical Thinking; FLLSE: The Foreign Language Learning Self-esteem Scale; TSM: Teacher Support Measure; WGCTAF: The Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal Form A; MSS: The McCroskey Shyness Scale; FLCAS: The Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale; RMSEA: The Root-Mean-Squared Error of Approximation; GFI: The Goodness-of-fit; NFI: The Goodness-of-fit; CFI: The Comparative Fit Index\nAcknowledgements: Not applicable.\nCorrespondence:\nAuthor details: 1 https://ror.org/02rkvz144, grid.27446.33, 0000 0004 1789 9163, School of History and Culture, Northeast Normal University, , 130024, Changchun, People's Republic of China. 2 https://ror.org/0161hbt42, grid.510437.4, 0000 0004 7425 0053, Department of English Language, Faculty of Literature and Humanities, University of Gonabad, , Gonabad, Iran.",
        "results": "Results\nThis part provides an exposition of the findings derived from the data analysis, with comprehensive elucidations for each constituent element. The first phase (Table 1) entails the analysis of descriptive data about the different elements of each instrument.\nTable 1:\nDescriptive statistics\nUpon considering self-esteem, the prevailing course of action was seeking out Attitude toward Behavior in the Class of Foreign Language, with a mean score of 23.600 and a standard deviation of 6.062. Upon deconstructing the major factors of the TS scale, it was shown that Teacher Personal Support had the highest average value (M = 14.395, SD = 3.684) compared to the other core variables within the scale. The variable of Recognizing Assumptions had the highest level of significance in relation to CT. The average score on the fourth instrument, Shyness, was 35.584, with a standard deviation of 11.406. Moreover, Fear of Negative Evaluation exhibited a mean score of 30.161, accompanied by a standard deviation of 9.603.\nThe data was then subjected to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in order to identify any anomalous patterns. The results are shown in Table 2.\nTable 2:\nThe results of kolmogorov smirnov test\nBased on the data shown in Table 2, the values of all instruments and their respective components are above the threshold of 0.05. As a result of this observation, it may be inferred that parametric approaches are appropriate for the analysis of the data.\nIn this study, the link between self-esteem, TS, CT, shyness, and anxiety are examined using a Pearson product-moment correlation analysis.\nTable 3:\nThe correlation coefficients between the self-esteem, TS, CT, shyness, and anxiety\nReferring to Table 3, the association between self-esteem, shyness, and anxiety subcomponents were negative. The variables of shyness (r = -0.834), communication anxiety (r = -0.794), fear of negative evaluation (r = -0.782), test anxiety (r = -0.713), and anxiety of foreign language class (r = -0.743) demonstrated a significant correlation. Furthermore, it was shown that there were statistically significant negative relationships between TS, shyness, and anxiety subcomponents. The variables examined in this study were shyness (r = -0.940), communication anxiety (r = -0.883), fear of negative evaluation (r = -0.877), test anxiety (r = -0.846), and anxiety of foreign language class (r = -0.908). Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation observed between the subcomponents of anxiety, shyness, and CT. Specifically, the correlations were as follows: shyness (r = -0.563), communication anxiety (r = -0.645), fear of negative evaluation (r = -0.679), test anxiety (r = -0.609), and anxiety of foreign language class (r = -0.655).\nThe results are shown in Table 4, which demonstrates that all of the fitness levels for Model 1 fall within the permissible thresholds. The aforementioned values consist of the chi-square/df ratio (2.958), the root-mean-squared error of approximation (RMSEA) (0.071), the goodness-of-fit (GFI) (0.947), the goodness-of-fit (NFI) (0.938), and the comparative fit index (CFI) (0.962).\nTable 4:\nModel fit indices\nIn addition, Table 4 provides further evidence that the chi-square/df ratio (2.994), the RMSEA (0.072), the GFI (0.956), the NFI (0.961), and the CFI (0.978) all meet the criteria for a satisfactory fit with respect to Model 2.\nFig. 2:\nThe symbolic representation of the values of the path coefficients (Model 1)\nFig. 3:\nT values for path coefficient significance (Model 1)\nTable 5:\nSummary of the findings in Model 1\nThe visual representation of the relationship among the components is shown in Figs. 2 and 3, as well as in Table 5. The standardized estimates and t-values indicate a significant correlation between self-esteem and shyness ([beta] = -0.80, t = -22.76), as well as between TS and shyness ([beta] = -0.93, t = -31.12). Furthermore, the relationship between CT and shyness ([beta] = -0.54, t = -8.23) was found to be negative. Similarly, negative relationships were seen between self-esteem and anxiety ([beta] = -0.74, t = -17.65), TS and anxiety ([beta] = -0.86, t = -25.12), as well as CT and anxiety ([beta] = -0.62, t = -12.23).\nFig. 4:\nThe symbolic representation of the values of the path coefficients (Model 2)\nFig. 5:\nT values for path coefficient significance (Model 2)\nTable 6:\nSummary of the findings in Model 6\nThe detailed relationships among the subscales are illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5 as well as Table 6.\nThe results indicate a significant and unfavorable correlation between the subsequent factors: Self-esteem and shyness ([beta]= -0.80, t= -22.43), TS and shyness ([beta]= -0.93, t= -30.74), as well as CT and shyness ([beta]= -0.54, t= -7.76). In a similar vein, a statistically significant association was observed between the subscales, namely self-esteem and communication anxiety ([beta]= -0.78, t= -20.81), TS and communication anxiety ([beta]=-0.87, t= -25.33), CT and communication anxiety ([beta] =-0.61, t= -11.59), self-esteem and fear of negative evaluation ([beta]= -0.76, t= -18.84), TS and fear of negative evaluation ([beta]=-0.85, t= -24.76), as well as CT and fear of negative evaluation ([beta]=-0.66, t= -13.27). The results indicate that there were negative and statistically significant relationships between self-esteem and test anxiety ([beta]=--0.69, t= -14.32), TS and test anxiety ([beta]=-0.82, t= -22.95), CT and test anxiety ([beta]=-0.58, t= -9.64), self-esteem and anxiety of foreign language class ([beta]=-0.72, t= -16.55), TS and anxiety of foreign language class ([beta]=-0.90, t= -28.68), and TS and anxiety of foreign language class ([beta]=-0.64, t= -12.88).",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThe primary objective of this research was to examine the correlation between self-esteem, TS, and CT with shyness and anxiety in language courses within an EFL environment. Consequently, a model was constructed and assessed using SEM to illustrate the interrelationships among these components in this study. The results indicate that self-esteem, TS, and CT strongly influenced the levels of shyness and anxiety experienced by students in language lessons. The mediating effects of self-esteem, TS, and CT are emphasized and discussed below in relation to the connections shown in Models 1 and 2.\nThe first inquiry was to ascertain the degree to which the elevated levels of self-esteem among EFL students influenced the reduction of shyness and anxiety in language lessons. The findings revealed that pupils with higher self-esteem levels felt lesser shyness and anxiety. The theoretical implications of this discovery might be debated. The idea of self-esteem is supported theoretically by both self-determination theory and self-identity theory [16, 18]. EFL leaners may benefit from self-esteem both directly and indirectly since it helps them develop a good sense of self, which in turn fosters positive attitudes about schoolwork and evaluations. The favorable effect of self-esteem on shyness and anxiety, which are fundamental ideas in the field of EFL, is consistent with the results of [58], who came to a similar conclusion.\nA positive self-concept, which is a result of self-esteem, assists language learners in cultivating robust cognitive, metacognitive, and problem-solving abilities. This conclusion aligns with the fundamental principles of social-cognitive theory [55], which emphasize the need of students actively monitoring and assessing their own performance and making necessary modifications to optimize their efficacy. The self-determination theory proposed by [59] states that an increase in an individual's level of self-awareness results in improvements in that person's levels of motivation, satisfaction, and social participation.\nWith regard to the second research question, it was found that EFL students who perceived high levels of TS felt more confident and less shy. The acquisition of a foreign language is often facilitated inside a classroom setting, when learners are supported by teachers and their peers. This particular circumstance might elicit feelings of worry, particularly among those who possess introverted tendencies, since they harbor apprehensions of potential unfavorable challenges. Through the process of identifying these learners, educators may get an understanding of the specific sort of motivation that drives their engagement with EFL learning. Additionally, educators can assess the extent to which these learners are inclined to engage in communicative activities, and subsequently, tailor instructional techniques that align with their individual learning requirements [60].\nBased on an analysis of students' personality traits, such as shyness, and their level of readiness to speak, an educator may assess their engagement in classroom activities and then adapt the curriculum as needed. For instance, in the event that a greater number of introverted students exhibit hesitancy in participating actively during classroom discussions, it may be beneficial to allocate a greater proportion of the curriculum to pair work or solo tasks. This approach aims to provide a learning environment that minimizes the perceived risks associated with public speaking. This finding is supported by the outcomes of [61, 62]. They discovered a positive correlation between the level of shyness and the level of fear of language class anxiety, such that an increase in shyness is accompanied by an increase in class anxiety, and conversely, a decrease in shyness is accompanied by a decrease in class anxiety.\nThe third purpose of this research was to determine whether introverted and anxious feelings diminished in EFL students who used CT. According to the results, students may better safeguard and increase their chances of success by strengthening their conceptual and metacognitive abilities. The results of the second model show that CT significantly declined shyness and anxiety components. To restate, CT directs EFL students in their assessments of the value of the university and their sense of belonging there, as well as in their convictions regarding the efficacy of their language classes. Students are highly encouraged to actively participate in class debates and other speaking exercises, since they are an essential component of any language education [15, 57].\nThis conclusion is logical when one takes into account the fact that students perceptions broaden as they acquire proficiency in language abilities. The CT of EFL students has a significant role in shaping their feeling of identity and academic success. As students actively participate in CT techniques, they increasingly undergo beneficial transformations in their attitudes and beliefs. The researchers [40, 44, 49] reached identical findings. They have shown that there is a correlation between the ability to participate in advanced cognitive processes, self-control, interpersonal skills, and belief in one's own abilities.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusion and pedagogical implications\nIn brief, this study set out to examine the potential relationships that exist among self-esteem, TS, and CT to shyness and anxiety at tertiary institutions. In this study, a model hypothesis is generated and tested using structural equation modeling and factor analysis. The findings show that self-esteem, TS, and CT have substantial effects on EFL students' positive attitudes and academic success. The acquired results supported the suggested model, validating the predictive abilities of self-esteem, TS, and CT to shyness and anxiety. The extent to which EFL students engaged in self-esteem and CT as well as teacher support influenced not only their willingness to communicate but also their academic achievement.",

        "abstract": "We constructed and tested a moderated mediation model to explore the influence of critical thinking on creativity by examining the mediating role of creative self-efficacy (CSE) and the moderating role of perceived school support for creativity (PSSC) in this relationship. The sample comprised 413 Chinese college students who completed a survey at two time points. The empirical analysis results showed that college students' critical thinking was positively related to their creativity. Further, the CSE of college students partially mediated the positive relationship between critical thinking and creativity. In addition, PSSC positively moderated the relationships between critical thinking, CSE, and creativity, that is, when the PSSC of college students was higher, the promotion effect of critical thinking on CSE was enhanced, ultimately promoting creativity. These conclusions enrich the relevant literature on critical thinking, CSE, PSSC, and creativity, and also provide suggestions for the higher education field on how to improve the creativity of college students.\nKeywords critical thinking, perceived school support for creativity, creative self-efficacy, creativity, college students\nArticle Highlights\n* College students' critical thinking was found to be positively related to their creativity.\n* The creative self-efficacy of college students partially mediated the positive relationship between critical thinking and creativity.\n* Perceived school support for creativity positively moderated the relationships between critical thinking, creative self-efficacy, and creativity.",
        "introduction": "",
        "methodology": "Critical thinking has been widely recognized as an indispensable cognitive skill in the 21st century (Karahan & iskifoglu, 2020). The study of individual critical thinking has received extensive attention in many fields, such as education, management, philosophy, and psychology (Mao et al., 2022). From a pedagogical perspective, critical thinking is a method to encourage students to actively question and challenge norms, which may lead to critical actions that change the status quo (Tsai, 2019). Numerous studies have established that critical thinking is associated with positive cognitive outcomes (Shin, 1998), and may improve the willingness, ability, and attitude of college students to participate in creative activities (Qiang et al., 2020). Creativity refers to the novel and practical ideas or concepts that individuals build on existing products, processes, and services in a particular organization (Zhou & Hoever, 2014). College students' creativity is affected by individual factors, such as personality traits, thinking ability, motivation, and emotion (Wang et al., 2022). However, the relationship between the critical thinking and creativity of college students has not been fully revealed, especially in the Chinese context.\nThe component theory of creativity (Amabile, 1988) emphasizes that task motivation, domain-relevant skills, and creativity-relevant processes are the three key components that affect individual creativity. As one of the main components of individual motivation, creative self-efficacy (CSE) is also an important internal process influencing individual creativity (Tierney & Farmer, 2011). Hence, we introduced CSE as a mediator of the relationship between critical thinking and creativity. A supportive environment directly affects an individual's intrinsic motivation to be creative, and individual creativity is the result of the interaction between individual characteristics and organizational context (Woodman et al., 1993). For college students, when their perceived school support for creativity (PSSC; i.e., their subjective perception of the degree to which their college recognizes, supports, and encourages their creativity) is high, they usually have higher positive expectations and confidence in the success of innovation (Ma, 2009), and ultimately exhibit higher creativity. Therefore, we believed that PSSC would moderate the relationships between critical thinking, CSE, and creativity. Taken together, the proposed conceptual model is shown in Figure 1.\nCritical Thinking and Creativity\nIt is well-known that creativity begins with identifying a problem (Felin & Zenger, 2014). Only by truly recognizing the problem can we put forward valuable questions that are derived from critical reflection on and analysis of the current situation (Facione, 1990). That is to say, college students with good critical thinking skills are more likely to bypass traditional thinking, view book knowledge critically, and be unwilling to blindly follow the authority of experts (Huber & Kuncel, 2016). This allows them to break out of a fixed mindset; propose, evaluate, and execute creative ideas (Meng & Zhao, 2018); and ultimately promote their creativity. College students with critical-thinking skills habitually use critical perspectives to analyze and solve problems (Chan, 2013), question unreasonable conventions, and strengthen their interest in their own work (Drake & Reid, 2018). Many previous studies have confirmed that if individuals are interested in what they are doing, they generally have a high level of creativity (Niu, 2007; Woodman et al., 1993). Hence, we posited the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: Critical thinking will be positively related to creativity.\nThe Mediating Role of Creative Self-Efficacy\nIn terms of the factors influencing CSE, we believed that critical thinking would play a positive role in promoting the CSE of college students. Specifically, an important characteristic of college students' critical thinking is their confidence in the reasoning process, that is, in their rational analysis ability (Shin, 1998). They usually believe that they can make reasonable judgments and be trusted by others (D'Alessio et al., 2019), which enhances their confidence in the creative process and improves their CSE. Besides, college students with critical-thinking skills usually enjoy exploring knowledge and seeking truth (Huber & Kuncel, 2016), which manifests as having the courage to question, deny, and surpass traditional knowledge or theories; the courage to persist and challenge in the face of difficulties (Tsai, 2019); and the perseverance to complete creative work. In such processes, college students are endowed with a sense of efficacy and their CSE may be continuously strengthened. Therefore, we posited the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2: Creative self-efficacy will play a mediating role in the relationship between critical thinking and creativity.\nThe Moderating Role of Perceived School Support for Creativity\nAccording to the componential theory of creativity, a supportive environment is an important factor for the development of individual creativity (Amabile, 1988). Perceived school support for creativity forms a situational support factor in the process of college students' cognitive adjustment (Lubans et al., 2011), and then enhances the positive impact of critical thinking on CSE and creativity. For college students with a high level of critical thinking, the more creativity support they perceive from their school, the better is their psychological expectation of creative results, so that they are more convinced of their ability and more willing to carry out creative activities, thus promoting CSE and creativity. Taken together, we posited the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 3: Perceived school support for creativity will moderate the relationship between critical thinking and creative self-efficacy.\nHypothesis 4: Perceived school support for creativity will moderate the mediating effect of creative self-efficacy on the relationship between critical thinking and creativity.\nMethod\nProcedure\nWe adopted a survey design to test the research hypotheses and theoretical model. Considering our resource limitations, we used random sampling to select 500 students from a general research college in Beijing, China. We assured the students that the survey results would be used for academic research purposes only and kept strictly confidential. In addition, we followed Podsakoff et al.'s (2003) suggestion to collect the data at two time points to reduce the likelihood of common method variance. At Time 1 students reported their critical thinking, PSSC, and demographic information (including gender, age, and grade). One month later, students rated their CSE and creativity at Time 2. All participants provided informed consent to take part in the study. We also received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of Capital Normal University (CNU00120221222003).\nParticipants\nAfter matching and cleaning up the data, the final sample consisted of 413 students, yielding a response rate of 82.6%. Among them, 190 (46.0%) were men and 223 (54.0%) were women, aged between 17 and 21 years (M = 19.08, SD =1.23). Regarding grade level, there were 121 freshmen (29.3%), 139 sophomores (33.6%), 111 juniors (26.9%), and 42 seniors (10.2%).\nMeasures\nItems were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. We translated the scales into Chinese using back-translation.\nCritical Thinking\nWe measured critical thinking using Jiang and Yang's (2015) five-item scale, which was developed from the research of Facione (1990) and has been validated in the Chinese context (Qian et al., 2017). A sample item is \"I often try to find alternative solutions to a problem.\" Cronbach's alpha in this study was .83.\nPerceived School Support for Creativity\nWe measured PSSC using Amabile's (1988) eight-item scale, which has been verified for use in the cultural background of Chinese colleges by Chang et al. (2016). A sample item is \"I was often encouraged to solve problems creatively.\" Cronbach's alpha in this study was .90.\nCreative Self-Efficacy\nWe measured CSE using Tierney and Farmer's (2011) three-item scale, which is a simplified cross-cultural version of the original scale and has been validated by Gu et al. (2017) with a sample of Chinese college students. A sample item is \"I'm pretty good at generating new ideas.\" Cronbach's alpha in this study was .76.\nCreativity\nWe measured creativity using Tierney et al.'s (1999) six-item scale, which is based on Amabile's (1988) definition of creativity and has been validated with Chinese samples (Meng & Zhao, 2018). A sample item is \"I often come up with new perspectives on research problems.\" Cronbach's alpha in this study was .88.\nControl Variables\nNumerous studies have suggested that the gender, age, and grade of college students can affect their creativity and perception of school support (e.g., Chang et al., 2016; Lubans et al., 2011). Hence, we controlled for these variables in testing the proposed theoretical model. Gender was coded as 1 = male and 2 = female. Grade was divided into four levels: 1 = freshmen, 2 = sophomores, 3 = juniors, and 4 = seniors.\nIn addition, since we collected data through self-reporting (Conway & Lance, 2010), there was a risk of common method variance (CMV). During the data-collection stage the students were informed that the results would remain anonymous, and we reverse coded some items and used Harman's single-factor test (Podsakoff et al., 2003) to assess CMV. The test results indicated that the first factor in the exploratory factor analysis explained only 36.59% of the variance (ideal fit < 40%); thus, there was no significant CMV in our study.\nThe means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations among the four core variables are presented in Table 1. The focal variables were significantly related to one another.\nHypothesis Testing\nTable 2 reports the hierarchical regression results for the main study variables. As shown in Model 5, after controlling for gender, age, and grade, critical thinking was positively correlated with creativity, supporting Hypothesis 1.\nFor the mediating role of CSE, Model 6 in Table 2 shows that after CSE was added to the regression analysis model of critical thinking on creativity, both CSE and critical thinking were positively correlated with creativity. Therefore, the CSE of college students played a partial mediating role in the relationship between critical thinking and creativity, supporting Hypothesis 2.\nFor the moderating role of PSSC, after controlling for gender, age, and grade, critical thinking was positively associated with CSE (Model 2). The interaction term of critical thinking and PSSC was also significantly related to CSE (Model 3). Furthermore, we adopted Cohen et al.'s (2003) suggestion to plot this interaction as a conditional value of PSSC (M [+ or -] 1 SD), which is depicted in Figure 2. As shown, the strength of the positive link between critical thinking and CSE increased when PSSC was high (simple slope = .45, p < .01), but not when PSSC was low (simple slope = .05, p < .01). Thus, Hypothesis 3 was supported.\nFinally, we employed a bootstrapping analysis (Hayes, 2015) with the PROCESS macro (Model 7) to test the moderating role of PSSC in influencing the indirect effect of critical thinking on creativity via CSE. The results revealed that the influence of PSSC on the moderated mediation effect was significant, [beta] = .07, SE = 0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.02, 0.09]. Further, the mediating effect of CSE on the critical thinking-creativity relationship became stronger when PSSC was high, [beta] = .06, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [0.01, 0.13], but not when PSSC was low, [beta] = .01, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.05]. In other words, PSSC positively moderated the mediating effect of CSE in the relationship between critical thinking and creativity. Taken together, Hypothesis 4 and the whole model were fully supported.\nUsing a two-time-point data collection method with a sample of Chinese college students, we found that critical thinking is positively correlated with creativity, and that this positive correlation is partially mediated by CSE. Furthermore, the PSSC of college students moderates both the positive correlation between critical thinking and CSE, and the mediating effect of CSE on the relationship between critical thinking and creativity.\nTheoretical and Practical Implications\nFor theoretical implications, we first confirmed that the critical thinking of college students has a positive influence on their creativity. This result not only effectively promotes the development of critical thinking theory in the field of educational psychology (Qiang et al., 2020), but also further enriches understanding of creativity theory as it relates to college students (Jiang & Yang, 2015; Ma, 2009). Second, we introduced CSE as a mediating variable to explain the internal influence process of critical thinking on creativity, which provides new evidence that the CSE of college students is an important mediating factor in the relationship between their individual characteristics and creativity (Puente-Diaz, 2016), and further enriches the literature on self-efficacy theory in the field of education (Peach et al., 2007). Finally, we verified that the PSSC of college students plays a moderating role in the relationships between their critical thinking, CSE, and creativity, which broadens understanding of the boundary condition of these relationships (Ma, 2009) and contributes to the literature on school support theory (Qiang et al., 2020).\nIn practice, critical thinking has always been seen as an important part of the education platform. In view of this, we have practical suggestions for how to effectively promote the creativity of college students. First, colleges should recognize and commend the efforts made by faculty members in the cultivation of college students' critical thinking, and advocate for and build the teaching culture and atmosphere to facilitate this process. Second, teachers, as the group that has the most contact with college students in the context of higher education, should pay close attention to changes in students' self-efficacy and use various methods to provide psychological intervention and counseling to improve their self-efficacy. In addition, when evaluating college students, it is necessary to change the traditional way of judging grades based on grades alone by instead focusing on their professional ability and comprehensive quality.\nLimitations and Directions for Future Research\nFirst, all variables were measured through self-reporting. Future research would benefit from measuring variables at different times from different sources. Second, the sample comprised students from only one university in Beijing, China, which may limit the extent to which the conclusions are applicable to other cultures or countries. Future scholars could use samples from diverse organizational settings under different cultural backgrounds to investigate the generalizability of the proposed theoretical model. Third, we constructed and confirmed a moderated mediation model to discuss the mediating role of CSE and the moderating role of PSSC in the relationship between critical thinking and creativity. However, other variables could explain or modulate this relationship. Thus, future researchers could go further by incorporating other mediating or moderating variables, such as positive emotions, knowledge sharing, intrinsic motivation, and mindfulness.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (21CMZ040).\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available on request from the corresponding author.\nConway, J.

        "introduction": "Introduction\nWorldwide, teenage pregnancies and adolescent motherhood have a significant impact on the individual, offspring, and family. Pregnancies are identified as a major risk factor for anxiety and depression, especially in the teenage years.[1] Adolescent pregnancies are a global burden in developed as well as developing countries. However, the United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF) states that most of these pregnancies are driven by poverty, lack of education, and reduced employment opportunities and occur in marginalized communities.[2] In a developing country like India, depression is a major public health concern, especially among adolescent females. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) states that in developing countries, complications related to pregnancy and childbirth are the main cause of death among 15- to 19-year-old adolescent brides.[3] The adolescent period is often accompanied by a spectrum of rapid metabolic, hormonal, physiologic, and developmental changes,[4] which in itself is stressful, and this stress is exacerbated by pregnancy, childbirth, and caring for the infant during adolescence. Threatened by a large number of bodily changes, adolescents indulge in risky behavior, alcohol consumption, and drugs or engage in impulsive sexual behavior in attempts to deny their fears.[5] Pregnancy comes with concomitant physiologic and psychological changes and has often been considered a time of emotional well-being.[6] The implications for the health and well-being of the mother and the infant and society are substantial.[7] Young women who marry early have a high risk of depression and suicide.[8] Further, their vulnerability is raised by pregnancy during adolescence. Adolescent mothers have higher chances of having stressful life events in the past, lower cognitive attainment, and poorer school performances in comparison to their non-parenting peers.[9] Although there are thoughts that pregnancy may act as a protection against mental illnesses, however a high prevalence of depression among pregnant women contradicts such beliefs.[10] Studies have reported that the prevalence of depression is higher among pregnant adolescents than for non-pregnant adolescents. Moreover, depression during pregnancy (antenatal depression) increases the risk for postpartum depression.[11],[12] The latest available data from the Fifth wave of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) indicated that 11% of the women in the age group 15-19 years were already a mother at the time of the survey. Further, the adolescent fertility rate was 77 per 1000.[13]\nConsistently, a wide variety of literature has documented higher depressive symptoms among adolescent mothers.[7],[14],[15],[16] Further, young women who marry early are at high risk of depression and suicide.[17],[18],[19] Pregnant and postpartum adolescents are more likely to suffer from depression than their non-pregnant counterparts.[20] Early childbearing poses negative consequences for mothers and their children. Further, it increases the risk of adverse mental health problems: substance abuse, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.[21] Additionally, stereotyping of adolescent mothers and discrimination leads to social exclusion and a high risk for postpartum depression.[22],[23] Adolescent mothers are usually unprepared for parental responsibilities, are poverty-stricken and live in disadvantaged environments, and have high-stress levels, low educational attainment, and fewer psychological resources than women who delay childbearing.[24] It is documented that pregnancy increases the risk of developing depression and anxiety symptoms increase, and this further worsens after childbirth.[25] Further, a study has demonstrated that the incidence of mortality, low birth weight, and pre-term birth is higher in adolescent mothers aged 10-14 years.[26] Additionally, studies have highlighted a significant association, India between depression and maternal age. It is stated that younger mothers experience higher levels of depression as compared to their older counterparts.[27] Domestic violence toward women also has some negative impacts on health such as chronic pain, depression, low self-esteem,[28] substance use, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide.[29]\nResearchers report that depression and anxiety are more prevalent among teenage mothers than adolescent mothers without any child.[25] Further, Evidence suggests that the incidence and prevalence of depression are increasing at a faster pace among youths than adults.[30] Despite a growing literature on depression, the focus has been on adults. Although adolescent childbearing raises important concerns for healthcare providers and society, there is a paucity of research on depression in pregnant adolescents. Considering the severe implications of depression among pregnant teens, this paper aims to draw attention to the prevalence of depression and its correlates among currently married, ever pregnant adolescents from two Indian States, i.e. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.",
        "methodology": "Background: Depression is a major public health concern among Indian adolescents. Pre- and post-natal depression can often alter fetal development and have negative consequences on the physical and mental health of the mother. This paper aims to draw attention to the prevalence of depression and its correlates among currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents from two Indian States, i.e. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Methods: This study utilizes data from a subsample (n = 3116) of the prospective cohort study Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults (UDAYA) among 10 to 19 year-old adolescents. Bivariate analysis was performed to assess the prevalence of depression by sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. To further access the predictors associated with depression a logistic regression model was applied. Results: Around one-tenth (9%) of pregnant adolescents had depression. Regression analysis indicated that substance use, religion, autonomy, considering attempting suicide, premarital relationship, violence, dowry, adverse pregnancy outcome, menstrual problem, and parental pressure for the child immediately after marriage were significantly associated with depression. Conclusions: This study confirms the pre-existing annotation that teen pregnancy is linked with depression. Findings indicate that Adolescent mothers experiencing violence, and a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes are at increased risk of developing depression. These study findings call for an urgent need to address depression among adolescent mothers.\nData and Methods\nWe utilized secondary data from the prospective cohort study Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults (UDAYA) among 10- to 19-year-old which was conducted in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (UP). This survey was led by the Population Council in the year 2016 and was supported by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, David and Lucile Packard Foundation under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), the Government of India. This study collected data on various aspects such as family, mobility and decision-making, self-efficacy, sexual and reproductive matters, health, substance abuse, violence, etc., from unmarried boys (10-19 years), unmarried girls (10-19 years) and married girls (15-19 years). This survey followed a multi-stage systematic sampling approach with three-stage sampling in rural areas and four-stage sampling in urban areas. We have analyzed the data of 3116 currently married adolescent mothers who have ever been pregnant.\nEthical considerations\nRespondent's had every right to refuse to participate or answer any question. Informed consent was sought from each individual to be interviewed, and among unmarried adolescents ages 10-17, consent was also sought from a parent or guardian. Names were never recorded in the computer form in which data were collected, and to preserve the confidentiality of the respondent or the parent/guardian, signing the consent form was optional; however, the interviewer was required to sign a statement that she or he had explained the content of the consent form to the respondent or parent. Privacy in the course of the interview was maintained. The UDAYA survey, which informed this study, was approved by the ethical review board of the Population Council, New Delhi.[31],[32]\nFlow diagram\nAccording to UDAYA Wave 1 (2015-2016), a total of 20594 adolescents are available in the data. Approximately one-fourth of them were married, out of which Gauna was not performed among 7% of women. Among currently married adolescents, a total of 3116 women were ever pregnant, and the remaining were not pregnant till the date of the survey. [Figure 1] summarizes filtering the eligible sample size/ever-been-pregnant for the analysis.{Figure 1}\nVariable's description\nOutcome variable\nThe outcome variable was depression, which was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) using nine items. It is a standard depression screening instrument used worldwide. The depressive severity was assessed using a Likert scale from the respondents. The Likert scale responses included 'not at all (0),' 'several days (1),' 'more than half the days (2),' and 'nearly every day (3).' The responses were recoded and a summary depressive symptom score ranging from 0 to 27 was generated, categorized as 'No depression' (0-9) and Depression' (10-27).[31],[32],[33]\nExposure variables\nSticking to the objectives, the female respondents who were married and were ever pregnant (15-19 years) were found to be eligible for this study. The survey was conducted only in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The place of residence was categorized as rural and urban. Caste was recoded as SC/ST (Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribe), OBC (Others Backward Classless), and Others. Religion was recoded as Hindu and Non-Hindu. The wealth index is composed of household asset data on ownership of selected durable goods, including means of transportation, as well as data on access to a number of amenities. Further, the wealth index was constructed by allocating the following scores to a household's reported assets or amenities and was divided into quintiles, recoded into poorest, poorest, middle, richer, and richest. Eligible respondents' years of education were taken into account, which were categorized as '0-7 years of schooling,' '8-10 years of schooling', '11-12 years of schooling' and '12+ years of schooling'. the variable on 'substance use in the family' was recoded as yes if respondents replied affirmatively on any member of the consuming drug/alcohol/tobacco products. Eligible respondents were asked if they played games and had any premarital relationship was recoded as 'no,' and 'yes.' Variables on father beating mother and violence against respondents used in this study were recoded as 'yes' and 'no.' Data on violence was categorized as emotional, physical and sexual for Married female adolescents. Violence was categorized as emotional if the respondent was ever humiliated in front of others or threatened to hurt or harm something close to her by her husband. Violence was categorized as sexual if the respondent was ever forced by her husband to have sex, including her first sex with her husband. The respondents were asked if they had faced menstrual problems in the last 3 months, and their response was recoded as 'no' and 'yes.' Variable on pressure for the child immediately after marriage was recoded as 'no' and 'yes.' Pregnancy desires were recoded as 'no' and 'yes.' The variable 'seriously considered attempted suicide' shows the response to the question 'During the past 1 year, did you ever seriously consider attempting suicide?' and their response was recoded as yes or no. The categorization/recode of the variables and their response are provided in [Supplement Table A].[INLINE:1]\nStatistical analysis\nFor analysis purposes, STATA 14.1 software was used. Univariate analysis was carried out to access the sample characteristics of currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents in the reproductive age group 15-19 years. Bivariate analysis was used to see the prevalence of depression by sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, and a further Chi-square test of significance was used to find the association between depression and background characteristics.\nA binary logistic model was employed to analyze the significant predictors. Logistic regression was chosen as the appropriate analysis method because the dependent variable had two categories: 'no' and 'yes,' represented by the codes 0 and 1, respectively.",
        "results": "Results\n[Table 1] presents the sample characteristics of currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents aged 15-19 years and the prevalence of depression by various sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. The majority of the women were from Bihar (67.42%), followed by Uttar Pradesh (32.58%). Among eligible respondents, most of them resided in the rural area (85%), three-fifths (59.5%) of the ever-pregnant women were from the OBC category, and the lowest proportion of respondents were from the Richest wealth index (12.88%). About three-fourths (75.6%) responded that they were living in a family where any of the family members was a substance user (drugs, alcohol, tobacco, at least one of them). Among all married adolescents, only 12% of the women were allowed to visit alone. Fifteen percent of the ever-pregnant adolescents had a premarital relationship. Around one-fifth (20.7%) had the pressure for a child immediately after marriage, and 59.1% reported having desired pregnancy. Only one-third (33.9%) of the currently married women had frequent access to media.{Table 1}\nEvery tenth of currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents was suffering from depression (9.11%). Depression was higher among married adolescents residing in urban areas (11%) and where any of the family members were substance users (10%). Approximately two-fifths (41.5%) of the women who ever seriously considered attempting suicide were found to be depressed. Concomitantly, the prevalence of depression was higher among adolescents who faced violence. Further, among women facing emotional violence, 14% had depression, and 13% of women facing emotional violence were depressed. The prevalence of depression was lower among adolescents who never faced dowry-related abuse or any adverse pregnancy outcome. The prevalence of depression was 13% among adolescents facing the pressure of a child immediately after marriage. Among currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents who did not have a desired pregnancy, 11% were depressed.\nResults obtained from logistic regression analysis are shown in [Table 2]. The women living in rural areas were 12% times and 25% times less likely to have depression (cOR: 0.78, CI: 0.68-1.13; aOR: 0.75, CI: 0.54-1.06) than the women living in an urban area. The religion of the respondent was significantly associated with depression with non-hindus bearing a higher risk of being depressed. Substance use in the family was significantly associated with depression (in the crude model). Adolescents from substance-user families were 1.82 times more likely to have depression than adolescents from non-substance-user families. The likelihood of having depression increased by 7.68 times and 5.06 times, respectively, among the adolescents who ever seriously considered attempting suicide in comparison to women who never seriously considered attempting suicide. Results show that the adolescents facing emotional violence were 2.17 times more likely to have depression, and those facing physical violence were 2.13 times more likely to have depression than those without experience of IPV. However, violence was not significantly associated when all variables were adjusted. Dowry-related abuse was statistically significantly associated with depression in crude as well as adjusted models. The married adolescents who were facing any dowry-related abuse were 2.94 and 2.83 times more likely to have depression than individuals without dowry abuse (crude and adjusted, respectively). Adolescents with adverse pregnancy outcomes were significantly more likely to have depression than women who did not have any adverse pregnancy outcomes in the crude and adjusted model. Adolescents who were currently pregnant were more likely to be depressed. Additionally, in the unadjusted model, adolescents facing menstrual problems in the last 3 months were 2.04 times more likely to have depression. Pressure for a child immediately after marriage was a significant predictor of depression in the adjusted and crude model. Adolescents who were pressured to have a child immediately after marriage were twice more likely to have depression.{Table 2}",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nEarly marriage negatively impacts the physical and psychological well-being of girls. Depression is one of the psychological problems that can occur as a consequence of early marriage. Additionally, pregnancy, if occurred in the teenage years, is an important risk factor for developing anxiety and depression. This study examines the prevalence of depressive symptoms among currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents aged 15-19 years and aims to explore the impact of socioeconomic status, substance use by the respondent or in the family, adverse pregnancy outcome, the experience of violence, and media exposure. The study reveals that depressive symptoms among currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents aged 15-19 years are higher among those residing in urban areas. The results obtained from the regression analysis indicated that religion, substance use, considering attempting suicide, playing games, premarital relationship, violence, dowry, adverse pregnancy outcome, menstrual problems, pressure for the child immediately after birth, pregnancy desire, and sex composition of a child born was significantly associated with depression--the prevalence of depression among currently married, ever-pregnant adolescents was found to be 9.11%. Evidence from past studies shows that the rates of depression vary widely from 16 to 44 percent among pregnant adolescents.[34],[35] Schoenbach and colleagues found the prevalence of depression to be 44% among pregnant teens.[7] Further, researchers report depression to be prevalent among 28% of adolescent mothers.[34],[36] Studies conducted in Mumbai and Bengaluru have reported a lower prevalence of antenatal depression during current pregnancy.[37],[38] Research suggests that rates of depressive disorder are twice higher among pregnant adolescents than adult mothers.[39] Contrary to other findings, the prevalence of depression was higher among respondents from the richer wealth quintile. However, no significant association was observed between wealth status and depression. Further, a number of studies support the hypothesis that lower levels of education are associated with increased depression; results from this study are not in agreement.[40],[41],[42] Findings from this study show that substance use in the family is statistically significantly associated with more depressive symptoms. Substance use has been linked with increasing lifetime occurrence of depressive disorders in the literature.[43],[44]\nWomen who ever considered attempting suicide were at higher risk of being depressed. A study has found that adolescents with suicidal ideation or attempts are at higher risk of developing depressive symptoms, in line with our findings.[35] A number of studies have shown that depression is caused by factors such as pregnancy problems and domestic violence.[18],[45],[46] Numerous studies have emphasized that girls who are married early have higher chances of facing violence in terms of getting physically or mentally abused by their husbands and in-laws.[35],[45] Raj and colleagues report that girls who are married in childhood are at higher risk for depression and suicidality especially due to increased exposure to gender-based violence.[47] Around one-third of adolescent mothers were facing different types of domestic violence. Domestic violence toward women has been reported to result in chronic pain, depression, low self-esteem, and substance use.[28] Further, consistent with our findings, a positive correlation between intimate partner violence and postpartum depression has been documented in the literature.[48],[49]\nOur findings indicate that women who have experienced dowry-related abuse are more likely to have depressive symptoms. Previous research has highlighted that women having dowry agreements have a higher probability of experiencing domestic violence. Further, domestic violence causes serious mental health issues. Harassment by in-laws on the pretext of dowry is reported to be associated with poor mental health and suicides in women.[50],[51] In our study, adolescent mothers having adverse pregnancy outcomes were more likely to have depression. A number of studies have described the prevalence of psychological disorders among parents who have experienced perinatal loss.[52] Histories of recurrent abortion and fetal and neonatal death are significantly associated with high rates of depressive symptoms.[53] The previous study reported an association between depression and anxiety during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and low birth weight.[54] The menstrual disorder was significantly associated with higher levels of depression. Menstrual disorders are documented to be associated with various psychological problems.[55],[56] Moreover, the most common psychological problems include anxiety and depression.[55] Our results indicate that women who are pressured to give birth immediately after marriage are more likely to have depressive symptoms. A meta-analysis conducted in India has shown that adolescents receiving social support from in-laws have a lower prevalence of depression, and social support (from in-laws) acts as a protective risk factor in peripartum depression.[36],[57]\nConsistent with our findings, studies have shown that women having undesired pregnancies are at an increased risk of depression during pregnancy.[58],[59],[60] Pregnancy in itself demands psychological, physiological, and financial preparation. Further, the social and economic burden associated with unplanned pregnancies results in psychological distress. However, results obtained from this study do not show any significant association between intended pregnancy and depression. Studies in India have highlighted that having a girl child is highly related to postnatal depression.[61] However, our study does not show any significant association between the sex of the child and depression among adolescent mothers.\nLimitations\nThe cross-sectional design of the study restricts establishing the causal inferences, and only correlates can be assessed. Additionally, data on the earlier history of depressive symptoms or other disorders were not available. Despite data being sensitive to identify depressive symptoms, the underreporting of symptoms cannot be ignored. Since the depression was not assessed by a psychiatrist, the self-reporting can be biased and may not be as reliable as diagnostic instruments. Although a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms was found among adolescents with adverse pregnancy outcome, it cannot be ascertained whether depression was due to adverse pregnancy outcome or depression following the adverse pregnancy outcome. Furthermore, because the research was limited to two Indian states, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the findings cannot be generalized to the entire country's population.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusions\nDespite the causal limitations, this study confirms the pre-existing annotation that teen pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of having depression. Findings indicate that Adolescent mothers who face violence, dowry-related abuse, menstrual disorder, and adverse pregnancy outcomes are at increased risk of developing depression. Since mental health is often a neglected aspect, especially among adolescents, findings call for an urgent need to address depression among adolescent mothers.\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nNil.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.",

        "introduction": "Introduction\nDissociative disorder is a unique condition that has been a focus of controversies about its definition and conceptualization. History and discussions go from demonology to science with a debate spanning for 4000 years; hysteria was strongly associated with supernatural beings and treated with sorcery.[1] It has been debated with a minimum understanding of its psychopathology. Hysteria is the most colorfully depicted neuroses of the 19th century that has drawn several great medical historians and writers. This is that incredible disease that has driven the minds of a great psychoanalytical theorist like Freud.[2] Dissociative disorder is a condition characterized by disruption of the normal continuity and integration of consciousness, memory, identity, motor functioning, and behavior.[3] It causes deficits in sensory and motor functions without any organic basis. The disease is mostly seen in adolescent and young adult women. It is seen often in rural and low socioeconomic status. The presence of stressors as a precipitating factor is often seen in cases of dissociation, but at times, it is difficult to ascertain one. The stressor may include family conflicts, academic failure, and death of dear ones.[4]\nWith rapid urbanization and growing mental health care, the incidence of dissociation is reducing in Western countries, but cases are still been reported in developing countries. Thus, the study of dissociation in developing countries is essential. The aim of the current study was to find the role of various psychosocial factors that influence the dissociative episodes. We also looked at the clinical profile and to find the relation between the type and levels of dissociation with levels of stress in the study population.",
        "methodology": "Background: Dissociative disorder is a condition characterized by disruption of the normal continuity and integration of consciousness, memory, identity, motor functioning, and behavior. Aims: The aim of the study was to study the various psychosocial factors that influence the dissociative episodes in patients. We also looked at the clinical profile and the relation between the type and levels of dissociation with levels of stress in the study sample. Materials and Methods: This descriptive, cross-sectional study with serial sampling had 50 participants who were diagnosed with dissociation as per the International Classification of Diseases-10 criteria. The study was conducted after obtaining clearance from the institutional ethics committee. Dissociative experience of the patients was measured using Severity of Dissociative Symptoms-Adult (Brief Dissociative Experiences Scale [DES-B]-Modified) and stress levels were measured using Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale. Results: The study showed that dissociation was more common among females from urban population, who were single and among students. Dissociative convulsions were found to be the most common type of dissociation in our culture. DES-B showed moderate-to-severe types of dissociative experience in the sample. In 46% of the participants, family conflicts acted as the most common stressor precipitating episodes. There was a psychodynamic connection/explanation between the perceived stress and the presenting complaint. Conclusion: This study highlights the common dissociations, stressors, and the difference seen among males and females. There is a need to understand the stressors of a patient presenting with dissociation for better psychological management.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe study was done at a tertiary care teaching hospital over a period of 1 year from August 2019 to August 2020 after the institutional ethics committee clearance (YEC2/242) dated 31st of January 2020.\nSample size was calculated using the following formula,[INSIDE:1]\nAt 5% level of significance, prevalence = 0.256, and estimation error = 14%, the total sample size was calculated to be 38. However, we included a total of 50 patients in our study.\nThis descriptive, cross-sectional convenient sample study involved 50 patients who presented to the hospital with a diagnosis of dissociative disorder. Patients of all ages and both inpatients and outpatients who were diagnosed to have dissociative disorder (F 44) according to the International Classification of Diseases-10 criteria were included in the study. Sociodemographic data were collected after taking written informed consent. Patients with intellectual problems and psychotic illnesses were excluded from the study. The study was carried out in accordance with the principles as enunciated in the Declaration of Helsinki.\nAssessment tools:\n*Severity of Dissociative Symptoms-Adult (Brief Dissociative Experiences Scale [DES-B]-Modified) to assess for the severity of dissociative symptoms:[5] It is an 8-item measure. Each item asks the individual to rate the severity of his or her dissociative experiences during the past 7 days on a five-point scale. The total score can range from 0 to 32\nFor persons between 11 and 17 years, Severity of Dissociative Symptoms-Child Age 11-17 (DES-B-Modified) was used.[6]\n*Presumptive Stressful Life Event Scale was used to assess stressors in patients with dissociative disorder:[7] It includes 51 life events, highest stress score being for death of spouse (95). Scores up to 40 indicate less stress, 41-200 indicate moderate stress, and >200 indicate severe stress.\nDescriptive statistics were used for reporting sociodemographical variables and clinical variables. An appropriate statistical test such as Chi-square test was used. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data obtained were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 23 and the results were analyzed.",
        "results": "Results\n[Table 1] shows the sociodemographic data and clinical details of the study sample. Among the 50 patients, 34 (68%) were female and 16 (32%) were male. The mean age of the study sample was 27.32 [+ or -] 11.01 years. Majority of the patients in the study were students (30%) and from urban area (62%). Most of them had completed their matriculation education (44%), single (50%), and were living in a nuclear family type (74%). Fifty-four percent of the patients belonged to low socioeconomic status group. On analyzing the family history, comorbidity, and history, we found that majority of the patients did not have any family history of psychiatric illness (88%) nor family history of dissociative disorder (86%). Furthermore, majority of them did not have any comorbid psychiatric or medical diagnosis (76%), whereas 27 (54%) patients had a history of dissociative episodes.{Table 1}\nVarious types of dissociative disorder in the study sample are shown in [Figure 1]. On categorizing the various types of dissociation in terms of age, we found that dissociative convulsions, dissociative stupor, and mixed dissociative disorder were seen in younger population. Dissociative motor disorder was mostly seen in older individuals. However, trance and possession disorder and dissociative amnesia were exclusively seen in younger population. In both the genders, dissociative convulsion was found to be the most common type of dissociative disorder, followed by dissociative motor disorder. Dissociative stupor, trance and possession disorder, and dissociative amnesia were seen only in females. In our study, 36% of patients experienced moderate and another 36% had severe dissociative symptoms, 22% of patients had mild severity of dissociative experience, and 6% of patients experienced extreme severity of dissociative symptoms. Clinical assessment of patient's stress is shown in [Figure 1].{Figure 1}\nThe difference in stressors between the gender and age groups is explained in [Table 2]. On Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale (PSLES), we found that majority of the patients below 30 years were suffering from moderate stress, while most of the patients above 30 years had severe stress levels. The perceived stress scale scores were found to be moderate in majority of cases of both genders. [Table 3] shows the DES-B scale score and predominant stressor cross-tabulation. Predominant stressor in various types of dissociative disorder is explained in [Table 4].{Table 2}{Table 3}{Table 4}\nWe analyzed the presenting complaints of individual patients in our study sample with the perceived stress as per clinical assessments.\n*A female patient had presented with complaints of forgetfulness to events that occurred after marriage. The patient developed this symptom after she was asked to go to her husband's family house where she was verbally abused *A 45-year-old male patient was completely mute after receiving a phone call from financial lenders to repay the loan taken *A 16-year-old male patient who was not interested to go to college was brought by family members with the complaint of inability to walk *A 25-year-old female patient was in stupourous state after her neighbors made unpleasant comments about her body shape *Another 25-year-old female had unresponsive episode during marriage proposals. Her childhood history revealed sexual abuse *A 20-year-old male who was not interested to speak to his parents due to family conflicts was brought with complaints of inability to speak.\nAll these cases point toward a connection between presenting symptom/particular dissociation and the stressor experienced.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nThere are only few studies on clinical features and sociodemography of patients suffering from dissociation. A study done by Deka et al . on 40 patients showed that dissociation was predominantly seen in young adults between the ages of 18-29 years.[4] Majority of patients (68%) in our study were <30 years of age, which is in line with the findings of other studies which show that dissociative disorder is more common among young adults.[8],[9],[10] The mean age of our study sample was found to be 27.32 [+ or -] 11.01 years. A cross-sectional study done by Reddy et al . on 55 patients revealed that the mean age of the sample was 21.96 [+ or -] 8.61 years.[11]\nIncluding the current study, many previous studies have shown that dissociative disorders are common among females.[4],[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[13],[14],[15],[16],[17],[18],[19],[20] Several explanations have been proposed for this including increased likelihood of seeking help, culturally acceptable modes of expressing distress, increased rates of sexual abuse, and high rates of comorbid depression and anxiety that have a female predominance.[21] Students formed the major group of the study population in work done by Deka et al .,[4] similar to this study. Several studies have been done in the past, which observed the geographical localization of patients in terms of dissociative symptoms. Deka et al . studied the area around the Indian state of Assam and found that majority of the patients with dissociation were from rural background.[4] A cross-sectional study done by Reddy et al . showed that 76.36% of patients were from rural background, while 23.46% had an urban background, which is in contrast to our study, which has predominantly an urban population.[11] In the past, various studies that looked into the education status of the population had given contrasting results. Deka et al . observed that most of the sample population were literates, while Tabassum and Farooq found 71% to be uneducated.[4],[18] Reddy et al . found that 41.82% of their population had reached high school.[11]\nPribor et al . studied a group of female psychiatric patients in the United States and found that majority of the patients were separated or divorced.[22] In the 2012 study published by Reddy et al ., it was found that 52.73% were unmarried and the rest 40% were married.[11] In our study, 50% were unmarried and 46% were married. Single persons are suffering more from dissociation, which indicates a younger age of onset. In the past, it was found that dissociation was more common in people from joint families. Vyas and Bharadwaj found that 61.51% of the cases were from joint families.[12] In contrast to this, our study found that 74% of the cases are from nuclear families, suggesting changing trends. Studies by Deka et al . (75%) and Reddy et al . (72.73%) had found that dissociation was more common in people from the lower socioeconomic background.[4],[11] However, Vyas and Bharadwaj in their study found that 50.32% of cases were from the lower middle-class background.[12] In contrast to the above studies, our study found that 46% were from above poverty line. Again, the above finding shows the changing economic trends of this country. Modeling is a type of observational learning where new behavior is learned by observing others in society. It plays an important role in the onset of dissociative symptoms in dissociative disorders. However, the role model need not be found currently and may be long forgotten. Samuels et al . in their study on children found that an illness model was found in 45% of their cases.[21] In our study, we found that 14% of cases had a family history of dissociative disorder, which significantly affected their modeling behavior. We also found that 12% of our sample had a family history of psychiatric illness other than dissociation.\nComorbid psychiatric conditions are very often found in patients with dissociative disorders. Ghosh et al . made a similar observation in their study and found that 35% of cases had comorbid anxiety or depression.[16] Reddy et al . also observed that comorbid psychiatric conditions were seen in 61.81% of cases, depression being the most common.[11] In contrast to this in our study, we found that comorbid psychiatric or medical diagnosis was seen in 24% of the patients.\nReddy et al . found that the most common presentation of dissociation was dissociative stupor, which was seen in 60% of their total sample, followed by dissociative motor disorder seen in 40% of total cases.[11] Another study by Turgay on children and adolescents with conversion disorder showed that pseudoseizures were the most common type of conversion symptom, which occurred in 63 cases of the 137 samples taken.[23] Spitzer et al . by studying their inpatient sample found that 29% of their cases had psychogenic seizures exclusively.[24] In our study too, dissociative convulsions in 60% of the total sample was the most common followed by dissociative motor disorder, which was seen in 20% of the people.\nWe further attempted to measure the age distribution of the various types of dissociative disorders. In our study, we found that 73.3% of dissociative convulsion cases were below 30 years of age. Similarly, dissociative stupor and mixed dissociative disorder were more common in the younger population. Dissociative motor disorder was more common in older age group. Dissociative amnesia, trance, and possession attack were exclusively seen in the younger age group. As per our knowledge, there have not been any previous studies looking at this parameter. We found that dissociative convulsion is the most common type of presentation in both the genders. However, dissociative stupor, trance, and possession disorder and dissociative amnesia were found only in females. Using DES-B, we found that 36% of our dissociation patients had moderate dissociative experience, while another 36% had severe dissociative experience. Extremely severe dissociative experience was seen in only 6% of cases. We could not find any study looking at this observation in dissociative disorder cases.\nSeveral studies have observed the predominant stress in people with dissociation. Ghosh et al . studied children and found that poor scholastic performance was the most common cause for dissociation in boys, while discrimination among siblings by parents was the most common stress among girls.[16] Reddy et al . found in their study that family disharmony was present in 41.82% of cases, which acted as the most common stressor in precipitating dissociative episodes.[11] Ammati et al . studied the common stressful life events in somatoform disorder patients and found that financial issues (27.7%) constituted the most common stressful life event in majority, followed by marital conflicts (20.5%) and family conflicts (18.7%).[25] In a recent study by Sawant and Umate, marital and family conflict were predominant stressors in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES).[20] Our study too found that 46% of cases had family conflict, which acted as an immediate stressor in precipitating dissociative episodes, followed by financial problems which were seen in 20% of cases.\nWe found that among males, 56% had financial problems as a predominant stressor. Among females, we found that 61% of them had family conflicts as the predominant stressor which precipitated episodes. A similar finding was observed by Ammati et al ., which found that females reported life events related to relationship issues and males reported more life events related to financial issues.[25] When we observed the stressors in two different age groups, we found that in the population <30 years, family conflicts acted as the most common stressor, while in patients above 30 years, financial problems were most significant.\nPSLES scores were also compared between males and females. We found that both males and females had dissociation with moderate stress. Similarly, when we looked into the age of the subjects, we found that majority of patients below 30 years of age had only moderate stress, while cases above 30 years of age had severe stress. We were unable to find any study looking at these factors.\nWe tried to find the predominant stressor in every type of dissociative disorder. On analyzing our data, we found that family conflicts were the most common reason for dissociative convulsions. The above finding was similar to the results shown by Sawant and Umate on PNES.[20] When we analyzed the dissociative motor disorders, we found that financial problems were the commonest precipitators. We further analyzed the association between the presenting complaint and the stressor. On analyzing the reason for a patient presenting with mutism following a phone call from lenders to repay the loan, we found that it could be a way to handle the present situation of stress. A young boy presented with an inability to walk as he was not interested to go to college. Similarly, a patient presenting with an unresponsive episode during marriage proposals might be a way to avoid the relationship. A patient presenting with amnesia only to events after her marriage might be to suppress the bad memories, which occurred previously. Similarly, all 50 cases were studied for the psychological connection. We can definitely see a connection between presenting complaints and the precipitating stressor in most of the patients.\nStrengths of our study are that it had a reasonable sample size, both genders included with all types of dissociation. We included more number of participants than required as per the sample size calculation. It included people of all ages including children. The present study looked at the stressors of individual patients and has analyzed the association between the clinical presentation of the patient and the stress. Limitations are its cross-sectional nature and study done in a hospital setting. Personality traits and coping mechanisms of the patients were not taken into consideration in our study. Recollection of stressors during interview can have some recall bias.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusion\nThis study showed the common stressors faced in our culture, the difference in both genders and age groups. It demonstrated the level of dissociation and corresponding level of stress in various types of dissociation. It explains the connection between the possible stress and the presenting symptom. The study of psychopathology in individual cases may yield higher evidence and insight into the problem. Hence, further follow-up studies can be done to look into the psychodynamic factors of this illness in depth.\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nNil.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.",

        "introduction": "Introduction\nNegative affectivity (NA) is a disposition trait defined by patterns of experiencing a range of unpleasant and negative emotions (Watson & Clark, 1984; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988b). Individuals vary in NA trait levels, and some individuals are more likely to experience negative emotions, even without an external stressor (Gross, 1999). Overall, NA is the state of inner feeling (affect) which occurs when one has failed to achieve a target or avoid a threat or when an individual is not fulfilled with the current state of affairs (APA, 2020). People who have difficulty in regulating of their negative emotions often experience exaggerated negative effects on several occasions and they are at the greater risk for developing of pathological anxiety and depression (Cohen et al., 2017; Davidson, 2000; Iqbal & Dar, 2015; Stringer, 2013; Watson, Clark, & Carey, 1988a). Studies have shown that emotional suppression may increase NA during emotional provocation in individuals while emotional acceptance may decrease NA and it prevent the development of anxiety disorders (Campbell-Sills, David, Brown, & Hofmann, 2006; Cisler & Olatunji, 2012). Also, research has demonstrated the important role of limbic system hyperactivity (e.g., amygdala) in responding to negative stimuli and impulsivity as sources of NA in the psychopathophysiology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults (Ferreira-Garcia, Gitahy Falcao Faria, Nardi, & da Rocha Freire, 2019; Yin et al., 2017).\nIn addition, NA is linked to more precise self-perceptions such as negative self-concept and low self-esteem that resulting in more sensory and perceptual dysfunctions (Conner & Barrett, 2005; Mirams et al., 2014). Also, research has shown that the negative effect is positively correlated with sensory sensitivity, avoidance and low enrollment in healthy adults (Engel-Yeger & Dunn, 2011a). Rothbart's temperament model conceptualised that negative affect is associated with sensory responsiveness and easy control with sensory regulation (Rothbart, 2011). Brindle, Moulding, Bakker, and Nedeljkovic (2015) showed significant correlations between sensory-processing sensitivity and symptoms of anxiety and stress. Otherwise, the concept of sensory processing of interoception can influence anxiety disorders including GAD (Khalsa et al., 2018). Aron, Aron, and Davies (2005) showed that individuals with sensory processing hypersensitivity (SPH) had higher scores on NA measures in their childhood compared to those with low sensory sensitivity. Studies indicated significant associations between sensory processing sensitivity and symptoms of depression and anxiety (Bakker & Moulding, 2012; Brindle et al., 2015). Greven et al. (2019) conceptualized that SPH as a differential susceptibility has an interaction with negative experiences, and in turn increases the risk of stress-related psychopathology such as anxiety disorders. Furthermore, people with sensory sensitivity and sensory processing problems like sensory evasion have more anxiety (Engel-Yeger & Dunn, 2011a; Machingura et al., 2019). Wamsley and Stickgold (2010) showed a relationship between sensory processing inputs and the creation of scenarios in dreams. Merced (2012) showed that brain areas that cover sensory functions become active during dreams. Windt, Harkness, and Lenggenhager (2014) suggested that sensory attenuation of self-produced tickles can influence the nature of dream characters. Also, dysfunctional patterns in sensory processing were related to sleep patterns and more sleep problems in adults (Foitzik & Brown, 2018; Engel-Yeger & Dunn, 2011b).\nAdditionally, the potential role of NA on sleep and dreams seems to be an important problem in the development of anxiety disorders. Alvaro, Roberts, and Harris (2013) suggested that insomnia can predict the prevalence of anxiety and depression and, consequently, these disorders can predict the prevalence of insomnia. Latif, Hughes, and Bendall (2019) showed that NA was positively correlated with sleep disturbances. Fortunato and Harsh (2006) proposed a hyper-responsivity model which suggests that NA operates to amplify individuals' perceptions and reactions to their negative environmental events, and then influences the aspects of sleep quality among them (Fortunato & Harsh, 2006). Zink and Pietrowsky (2015) suggested that protoconsciousness as the functional interaction between sleep and wakefulness depends primarily on emotions. Research has shown that real experiences of negative affects can influence the content of dreams (Kallmeyer & Chang, 1998; Ritchie & Skowronski, 2008). Clinical studies have demonstrated evidence on the possible relation between dream experience and affective disorders (Domhoff & Schneider, 2008; Levin & Nielsen, 2007; Schredl, 2011; Valli & Revonsuo, 2009). Schredl and Hofmann (2003) noted that emotional involvement may moderate the incorporation of waking-life experiences into dreams. Altogether, studies reported that dream experience represents a powerful linkage to affective processes in individuals (Scarpelli, Bartolacci, D'Atri, Gorgoni, & De Gennaro, 2019; Schredl, Gei\u00dfler, & G\u00f6ritz, 2019). Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the roles of NA and SPH in the prediction of sleep quality and dreams using the structural modeling equation (SEM) in outpatient adults with GAD.\nTheoritically, Freud (1900) and Jung (1948) claimed that the content of sleep and dreams reflect experiences that were hard to regulate in waking time because of their threatening nature. Freud (1900) proposed that latent content of dreams as the subconscious process included intensified sensations and negative affectivity of sleeper, and it protects the dreamer from disturbing drives until it turns into a manifest dream. Neuropsychoanalytical studies indicated that brain mechanisms of the dream are originated with a wish in daily life (Johnson & Flores Mosri, 2016). Cai (2015) hypothesized that rapid eye movement (REM) and non-speed eye movement (NREM) on sleep functions are most relevant to the assumptions of psychoanalysis in sleep and dreams. According to conceptualizations on sleep and dreams in psychodynamic and neuropsychoanalytical approaches (Freud, 1900; Johnson & Flores Mosri, 2016; Jung, 1948), neuropsychobiological models in dreams (Gallese, 2013; Hobson, 2009; Khalsa et al., 2018) and dream-based psychotherapies (Ellis, 2020; Hill & Knox, 2010); this study suggests that NA and HPS have potential roles in sleep and dreams in adults with GAD. Thus, it seems that psychological and neuropsychobiological dysfunctions using NA and SPH may influence sleep quality and dreams in patients with GAD. This study suggests that there are potential relationships between NA (i.e. depression, anxiety and stress), SPH; and NAS and SPH may help to predict sleep quality and dreams in outpatients with GAD. This study suggests that there are two types of variables in the Structural Equation Model (SEM) that cause a change in sleep and dream quality: (1) NA, and (2) SPH. This study suggests that there are direct or indirect effects between these independent variables and sleep quality (i.e., subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction) and dreams (i.e., dream recall and attitudes toward dreams(as the dependent variables in GAD. This study uses SEM to explore the direct and indirect effects of NA and SPH for explaining of overt and latent changes in sleep quality and dream in outpatients with GAD. The main hypothesis of this study is that NA and SPH would have significant direct and indirect effects on sleep quality and dreams in adults outpatients with GAD.",
        "methodology": "Background: This study is aimed to examine the direct and indirect effects of negative affectivity (NA) and sensory processing hypersensitivity (SPH) in the explanation of variations in dreams and sleep quality based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in outpatients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Methods: Mean age for women (N = 100) and men (N = 100) were 26.53 and 31.74 years, respectively. The participants responded to a demographic sheet, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales- 21 (DASS-21), the Highly Sensitive Persons Scale (HSPS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Mannheim Dream Questionnaire (MADRE) measures in this study. Results: The results showed a significant positive and direct connection between NA and SPH with dreams and sleep quality. SPH in outpatients with GAD moderated the relationship of NA with dreams and sleep quality. Finally, dreams and sleep quality had significant positive relationships in this sample. Conclusion: This conceptual model for dreams and sleep quality is beneficial for developing psychotherapeutic interventions in outpatients with GAD.\nAuthor(s): Siamak Khodarahimi 1 , Fazlolah Mirderikvand 1 , Kourosh Amraei 1\nAuthor Affiliations:\n(1) grid.411406.6, 0000 0004 1757 0173, Psychology Department, School of Literature and Humanities Sciences, Lorestan University, , Khorramabad, Iran\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe sample included 200 outpatient adults with GAD from Shiraz City, Fars province, Iran. All participants were recruited by a purposeful sampling procedure. Mean of the age for females and males were 26.53 (SD = 8.95) and 31.74 (SD = 11.52), respectively. The educational level ranged from under high school diploma (N = 53), associate (N = 64), bachelor (N = 76), and master and doctoral (N = 7) in this sample. Of the total participants, 121 were single and 79 individuals were married. All outpatients had a problem of sleep disturbance. The sample was comprised of Fars (N = 144), Lor (N = 29), and Turk (N = 27) ethnics and all were Muslims. The occupational positions in this sample consisted of management occupations (N = 12), office employee (N = 22), sales and service staff (N = 9), specialized farmer (N = 7), craftsmen and related businesses (N = 6), operator of machinery and technology (N = 3), and easy jobs (N = 141). Following informed consent, participants were asked to fill out a demographic questionnaire and Persian versions of four measures in Persian.\nInstruments\nDepression, Anxiety and Stress Scales- 21 (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). DASS-21 is a self-rating measurement scale that established to evaluate three affective and emotional conditions: Depression, anxiety, and stress. For scoring, participants read each statement, then circle a number 0, 1, 2 or 3 that indicates how much the claim applied to their affective status. The DASS-21 is broadly applied to measure symptoms of affective distress in clinical and non-clinical adult samples (Oei et al.,2013; Sinclair et al., 2012). Also, reliability and validity of the Persian version of DASS-21 has been satisfactory amongst the Iranian adult population (Asghari, Saed, & Dibajnia, 2008). This study showed Cronbach's internal constancy from. 70,. 74,. 73 and. 82 for depression, anxiety and stress and DASS-21, respectively.\nHighly Sensitive Persons Scale (HSPS; Aron & Aron, 1997). HSPS was used to examine physiological reactivity to external factors as well as subtle sensitivity to stimuli. The HSPS is a self-rating scale to evaluate the following three components: Ease of excitation, aesthetic sensitivity, and low sensory threshold. The HSPS is an inventory in which each statement is scored from 1 to 7 (1 = \"totally disagree\") to 7 (7 = \"totally agree\"). The HSPS showed the suitable reliability and content, convergent and discriminant validity in different populations (Aron & Aron, 1997; Ershova et al., 2018). Psychometric features of HSPS was demonestrated in the Iranian population (Sadooghi, Aguilar-Vafaie, & Rassoulzadeh Tabatabaei, 2008). This study showed internal Cronbach's consistency reliability of.75,.80,.81 and.77 for ease of excitation, aesthetic sensitivity and low sensory threshold subscales, and HSPS, respectively.\nPittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al.,1989). The PSQI is a subjective measure of sleep quality that is used to assess sleep patterns in adults during the last month. PSQI differentiates sleep quality by measuring of seven domains: Subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction. The participants asked to self-rate each of these seven areas of sleep. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. PSQI has internal consistency, reliability, and validity coefficient in a variety of adult populations (Buysse, Reynolds 3rd, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989; Hinz et al., 2017). This study showed internal Cronbach's consistency reliability of.71,.70,.71,.71,.84,.70,.71 and.78 for subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction, and PSQI, respectively.\nMannheim Dream Questionnaire (MADRE; Schredl, Berres, Klingauf, Schellhaas, & G\u00f6ritz, 2014). The MADRE is an inventory to get a good overview of the different aspects of dreams. The present questionnaire was developed to elicit some form of dream history including dream recall, nightmares, lucid dreaming, attitude towards dreams, and the effects of dreams on waking life. MADRE distinguishes dreams by measuring two domains: Dream recall and attitudes toward dreams. Altogether, retest reliability of MADRE scale was r =.756 (Schredl et al., 2014). The psychometric properties of MADRE were satisfactory (Schredl et al., 2014; Schredl & G\u00f6ritz, 2019). The MADRE indicated good psychometric properties in Iranian population; and its Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.75 for the overall scale (Shahabian et al., 2017). This study showed internal Cronbach's consistency reliability of.73,.71 and.78 for dream recall and attitudes toward dreams subscales, and MADRE, respectively.\nDesign and Procedure\nThis study was designed to explore the role of NA and SPH in predicting of sleep quality and dreams using SEM in a sample of outpatient adults with GAD. The sample size is determined with relevance to the statistics for SEM (Randolph & Myers, 2013). Inclusion criteria were (1) being an adult, (2) have no physical disease with mental symptoms, (3) have no comorbid psychological disorders, (4) to meet all criteria for GAD in DSM-5 Criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), (5) a score of more than 10 on the GAD-7 (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & L\u00f6we, 2006), (6) use no medications for GAD, (7) have a significant sleep problems, and (8) totally being able to understand the Persian language. Overall, 7 participants had less score than 10 in GAD-7 and they removed from the data pool. Volunteer participants were identified at several psychology clinics using a purposive sampling method as part of the study. There was no payment for participants.\nIndeed, this is a clinical knowledge with direct clinical implications for sleep quality and dreams GAD. Clinical psychologists and psychotherapists can apply these findings for addressing to the roles of negative affects and sensory processing dysfunctions in the treatment of sleep problems and dream applications in patients with GAD. The psychotherapeutic methods in clinical psychology should be consider the potential roles of NA and SPH in conceptualiziation and treatment of sleep disturbances and dream implementations in patients with GAD. Also, these results are valuable for the prevention purposes of dreams and sleep disturbances in adults' mental health programs, particularly for health and community psychologists who work with mind and body interaction in anxiety disorders. First, the present study has limitations because only self-reporting scales were utilized to measure NA, SPH, dreams and sleep disturbances. Second, it was a clinical sample in GAD rather than a representative sample in anxiety disorders and therefore findings cannot be generalised to anxiety disorders in adults. Third, this sample was from an eastern population and it should be justified in the western populations too. Future studies should investigate structural equation models for the direct and indirect effects of NA and SPH on dreams and sleep quality with multiple measures and qualitative methods in different types of anxiety disorders with diverse cultural backgrounds. Lastly, it is essential for upcoming studies to apply quantitative psychological tests, psychophysiological measures and qualitative techniques on behalf of clinicians to understand how NA and SPH can influence dreams and sleep quality in patients with GAD.\nDeclarations\nEthical Approval\nAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee.\nInformed Consent\nInformed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.\nData Transparency\nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nConflict of Interest\nAuthors have not any conflict of interst in this study.\nKline, R.

        "results": "Results\nSEM was used to examine the direct and indirect effects of NA (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress) as independent variable, and SPH (i.e., ease of excitation, aesthetic sensitivity and low sensory threshold) as moderating variable in the explanation of sleep quality (i.e., subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction) and dreams (i.e., dream recall and attitude towards dreams) as dependent variables in this sample. The manifest variables of NA involved depression, anxiety and stress. The manifest variables of SPH included ease of excitation, aesthetic sensitivity and low sensory threshold. The manifest variables of sleep quality were subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction. The manifest variables of dreams contained dream recall and attitude towards dreams. According to Kline (2011), the baseline assumptions for SEM implementation are met in this study. Table 1 represents descriptive statistics for the obvious variables. The lowest and highest values of Mahalanobis's distance were.57 and 11.70, respectively. This analysis showed no outliers in the manifest variables of the sample. In addition, absolute magnitude of kurtosis and skewness for all manifest variables were less than 3 and 10 in this study. Analysis showed that all manifest variables are normally distributed. Thereby, the assumption of normality for the implementation of SEM among manifest variables were met in the present study. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) ranged from.12 to 2.94, and the range of tolerance statistic was between.36 and.98. According to these findings, tolerance values for all variables were higher than 0.10. Also, values of VIF were less than 10 in the present study. These findings did not show any significant multicollinearity between variables in this sample. Altogether, analysis showed satisfactory basic assumptions for running the SEM in this study.

Consistent with the current hypothetical model, the results indicated that the evidence for the suitability of the conceptual model for predictive roles of independent and moderating variables in the explanation of dependent variables is generally satisfactory (RAMSE =.074, SRMR =.06, d-ULS =.933,, [chi]2/df = 733.34, NFI = 1.08).\nFigure 1 shows explained variance, factor loads, and direct and indirect effects of NA and SPH as independent variables in the explanation of dreams and sleep quality as dependent variables in this sample Thus, the effect of NA on dreams and sleep quality with regard to the moderating effects of SPH were computed using the SEM with Smart-PLS. Results indicated that NAS explain 52.5%, 85.9% and 81.9% of HPS, dreams and sleep quality variations in this sample (Fig. 1). These results relect the confirmation of the main hypothesis of this study.Fig. 1\nResults of SEM, Explained Variance, Factor Loads, Direct and Indirect Effects of Observed Variables\nWith regard to the path coefficients between latent constructs of the model, NA have positive relationships with SPH,.725; dreams,.222; and sleep quality,.338; whilst NA with the moderating effect of SPH have idirect positive path coefficient with dreams,.542; and sleep quality;.630, in this study. In addition, SPH variable have positive path coefficients with both of dreams and sleep quality respectively. Factor loadings for depression, anxiety and stress observed components of NA were.718,.891 and.777 respectively.

In addition, dreams and sleep quality had significant positive relationships,.225, in this sample (Fig. 1). Figure 2 illustrates then SEM coefficients and factorial loads for this study. Overall, t-value of the SEM lines for depression, anxiety and stress as obvious component of NA; aesthetic sensitivity and low sensory threshold as obvious components of SPH, and dreams and sleep quality as latent constructs was higher than 2.58 (Fig. 2).Fig. 2\nSignificance of SEM Coefficients and Factor Loads",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nFirst, reliability of measures using Cronbach's alpha and Composite Reliability (CR) and validity of measures using AVE for discriminant validity as a basic assumption for computation of SEM were affirmed in this study. Thus, the measures of NA, SPH, dreams and sleep quality are reliable and valid for this sample. These results are compatible with studies about the effectiveness of PLS software for calculation of psychometric properties of research measures (Schreiber et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2014).\nSecond, the results of SEM calculation for direct effects of NA as independent variable in explaining both manifest and latent variations of SPH as dependent variable showed that NA explain 52.5% of SPH variation in patients with GAD. These results support the main hypothesis and show the direct and predictive role of NA on SPH in this study. Results showed that depression, anxiety and stress have a significant positive path coefficient with SPH. Results indicated that factor loadings and the direct effect of observed variables were significant for depression, anxiety and stress on SPH. There was a direct significant positive relationship between depression, anxiety and stress with SPH. Therefore, all observed components of NA are effective on SPH. This finding is consistent with the literature which affirming the relationship between negative affectivity and sensory sensitivity in adults (Bakker & Moulding, 2012; Brindle et al., 2015; Engel-Yeger & Dunn, 2011a; Machingura et al., 2019). In line with Rothbart (2011) conceptualization, this study explored the role of negative affectivity on SPH in patients with GAD. As argued by Greven et al. (2019), it appears that negative affects and SPH interact with GAD risk.\nThird, the reults of this study showed significant positive and direct relationships between NAS, dreams and sleep quality in outpatients with GAD. Findings showed that NA explain 85.9% and 81.9% of dreams and sleep quality variations in patients with GAD. In addition, the results of this study indicated significant positive and direct relationships between NA, dreams and sleep quality in outpatients with GAD. Primarily, these findings are congruent to the literature which demonstrated the roles of negative affects as a temperamental and psychological predisposition by occurrence of psychopathophysiology mechanisms like increased sensitivity, emotional dysregulation, negative self-perceptions and suppression of negative emotions that influences the emergence of GAD and anxiety disorders in adults (Cisler & Olatunji, 2012; Cohen et al., 2017; Iqbal & Dar, 2015; Watson et al., 1988a). Subsequently, these results correspond to the literature that has demonstrated a bilateral relationship between NA, dreams and sleep quality in anxiety disorders (Alvaro et al., 2013; Bouwmans, Bos, Hoenders, Oldehinkel, & de Jonge, 2017; Kallmeyer & Chang, 1998; Latif et al., 2019; Levin & Nielsen, 2007; Schredl, 2011; Weinstein, Campbell, & Vansteenkiste, 2018). In line with Zink and Pietrowsky (2015) and Schredl and Hofmann (2003), these results suggest that hyperreactivity, protoconsciousness and mechanisms of emotional involvement are responsible for the influence of NA on dreams and sleep quality in patients with GAD. In addition, this study revealed significant negative and direct relationships between NA and the dreams in patients with GAD. This result is consistent with the assumptions of psychodynamic and analytic approaches in dream psychology (Cai, 2015; Freud, 1900; Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, Marcaggi, & Baleyte, 2013; Johnson & Flores Mosri, 2016; Zhu, 2013). According to these conceptualizations, this study suggests that increased NA in daily life may lead to higher emotional suppression, and this mechanism may reduce dream recall levels and dream attitudes in patients with GAD.\nForth, the results of the present study indicated significant positive and direct relationships between SPH, dreams and sleep quality in outpatients with GAD. Results indicated that factor loadings and the direct effect of observed variables were significant for the ease of excitation and aesthetic sensitivity compnents of SPH on dreams and sleep quality. These results are congreunt with the literature where it is indicated that interoception may increase the risk of anxiety in sensory processing sensitivity (Brindle et al., 2015; Khalsa et al., 2018). Moreover, these results are consistent with previous studies in the field of sensory processing experiences in waking, dreams and sleep quality (Engel-Yeger & Dunn, 2011b; Windt et al., 2014; Foitzik & Brown, 2018; Merced, 2012; Wamsley & Stickgold, 2010). Altogether, these investigations showed that daily sensory processing inputs could influence dreams and sleep quality through a full range of mind/brain states.\nFifth, the results in the current study showed significant indirect and positive relationships between NA with dreams and sleep quality by moderating role of SPH in outpatients with GAD. These results support the main hypothesis and show the indirect predictive role of NA with the moderating influence of SPH on dreams and sleep quality in this study. Results showed that depression, anxiety and stress components of NA have a significant positive path coefficient with dreams and sleep quality with the moderating effects of the ease of excitation and aesthetic sensitivity components of SPH. Therefore, all observed components of NA are indirectly effective on dreams and sleep quality by the moderating influence of SPH. In line with Rothbart's model of temperament (Rothbart, 2011), this study showed the moderating effect of SPH on relationships between NA with dreams and sleep quality in GAD. Altogether, these findings are consistent with the predictions of psychodynamic and analytical conceptualizations (Cai, 2015; Freud, 1900; Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 et al., 2013; Johnson & Flores Mosri, 2016; Zhu, 2013), neuropsychobiological models of dreams and sleep (Gallese, 2013; Hobson, 2009; Khalsa et al., 2018; Wamsley & Stickgold, 2010), and Rothbart's model of temperament (Rothbart, 2011). Regarding these theoritical frameworks, this study suggests that NA can ultimately influence dreams and sleep quality by producing of sensory and perceptual dysfunctions such as attentional bias, protoconsciousness processing and affective suppression. Thereby, sensory processing plays a mediating role between individuals' affective state and their dreams and sleep quality in GAD.\nSixth, the results of this study showed significant positive relationships between dreams and sleep quality in outpatients with GAD. This finding is in agreement with the assumption of bilateral relationship between dream and sleep in psychodynamic and neuropsychoanalytical approaches (Freud, 1900; Johnson & Flores Mosri, 2016; Jung, 1948) and neuropsychobiological models in dream and sleep theories (Gallese, 2013; Hobson, 2009; Khalsa et al., 2018). In conclusion, this study shows a fitted SEM for the predictive roles of NA and SPH, and indirect effect of NA with a moderating role of SPH on the prediction of dreams and sleep quality in outpatients with GAD.\nImplications, Limitations, and Future Suggestions",

        "abstract": "We investigated the association between social support and negative emotions in Chinese people aged 65 years and over, by comparing those who still had a spouse with those who had been widowed. Data were drawn from the 2018 Chinese Longitudinal Health and Longevity Survey of Elders. The results showed that there were significant differences between those who were widowed and those whose spouse was still alive in terms of the negative emotions of uselessness and loneliness, but not anxiety. The more informal and formal social support (excluding economic support and medical insurance) these older adults had, the fewer negative emotions they felt. These findings provide theoretical and practical insights for scholars who are researching the topic of old age, and also offer practical insights for older adults to maintain their health.\nKeywords negative emotions, older adults, social support, widowhood\nArticle Highlights\n* This study utilized data from the 2018 Chinese Longitudinal Health and Longevity Survey of Elders, which focused on people aged 65 years and over.\n* We found significant differences between those who had a spouse, and those who had been widowed in terms of the negative emotions of uselessness and loneliness.\n* With the exception of economic support and medical insurance, the more informal and formal social support older adults had, the fewer negative emotions they felt.\nSocial support for people aged 60 years and over has received worldwide attention (Bai et al., 2020). Social support is the relationship and interaction between two or more people who share resources, with the aim of strengthening positive emotions and enhancing happiness (Mohd et al., 2019), mainly including formal social support, provided by medical insurance, endowment insurance, and community services, and informal social support, consisting of financial and emotional support from family, friends, and neighbors (Tian & Chen, 2022). Emotions have a substantial impact on the cognitive processes and mental state of humans (Tyng et al., 2017). The negative emotions of people aged 60 years and over who are widowed (Davidow et al., 2022; F. Yang & Gu, 2021) and those in this age group who are living alone (Shin et al., 2018) have attracted social attention, and more social support has been provided. In the USA. it has been shown that providing social support delays further deterioration in the health of people aged 70 years and over (Choi & Wodarski, 1996). In another study conducted in the USA, Olabisi et al. (2023) showed that social support from family and friends has protective effects against depression in adults aged 50 years and over and can effectively alleviate symptoms of psychological illness.\nSelf-perceived uselessness represents the feeling of older adults of being of low usefulness or importance to others, and their general understanding of the aging process (Gruenewald et al., 2007). Although the participants in the study by Gruenewald et al. (2007) were aged between 70 and 79 years, this definition is consistent with the understanding of uselessness among other age groups. Zhao et al. (2017) found that among people aged 65 years and over in China, those who self-reported greater uselessness tended to have lower levels of physical activity, participation, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. Anxiety (Erickson & Rector, 2022), and social and emotional loneliness are major public health concerns affecting the well-being of community-dwelling people aged 65 years and over (Blakely & Baker, 2023). Loneliness is negatively correlated with life satisfaction and positively correlated with depression among older people (Liu et al., 2022).\nResearchers have shown that when assessing the social support and physical health of people aged 60 years and over, dispositional negative affect is an important individual difference that needs to be accounted for (J. Chen et al., 2022). In a study conducted in Wales with people aged 65 years and over, all of whom had the same level of social contact with friends and family, Evans et al. (2019) found that those with symptoms of depression or anxiety were more isolated and lonelier than those who were not depressed or anxious. The death of one's spouse brings the pain of loss and also leads to negative emotions, such as loneliness, depression, and anxiety, resulting in cognitive decline (Shin et al., 2018), sleep problems (van de Straat & Bracke, 2015), decline in quality of life (Tian & Chen, 2022), and reduced overall life satisfaction (C. Yang et al., 2021). In a study conducted in a remote county in Hunan Province, You et al. (2023) found that most of the women aged 60 years and over who were widowed had a high risk of experiencing negative psychological symptoms, and were prone to loneliness, depression, and anxiety.\nThus far, the focus in studies on negative emotions among people aged 60 years and over has been on anxiety, stress, anger, depression, sadness, and pain, with most examining the negative emotions of those who have been widowed, are being cared for in nursing homes, have dementia, or who have diseases and are living in hospitals. In China, a large group of people aged 60 years and over are living in the community, and their health status is, to some extent, witness to the effectiveness of the implementation of a national healthy aging strategy. As they age, people develop chronic diseases, experience a reduction in social interaction and change in social role, and show a gradual deterioration of health status. With decline in self-care ability and an increase in dependency, people become more vulnerable to negative emotions (Zauszniewski et al., 2004). If negative emotions, such as uselessness, loneliness, and anxiety (Y. Li et al., 2022), are not resolved in a timely manner, they affect not only the physical and mental health of the person as they age, but also their happiness and quality of life.\nThus, in this study we explored the associations between formal and informal social support and negative emotions among Chinese people aged 65 years and over, comparing those who were still living with their spouse with those who had been widowed. Our aim was to provide theoretical and practical insights into psychological health in old age.",
        "introduction": "",
        "methodology": "Method\nParticipants and Procedure\nThis study was performed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration guidelines. We sought and received permission to use the database from the team who conducted the 2018 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS-2018). Informed consent for their survey was obtained from the participants and the survey was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of Duke University and Peking University (IRB00001052-13074).\nAll data in this study were drawn from the CLHLS-2018. We selected eligible respondents aged 65 years or over, and excluded those who answered the items for demographic characteristics and formal and informal social support with the option \"I don't know\" or who gave no answer. Finally, 9,301 adults in the eligible age group were included in our dataset (see Table 1).\nData Analysis\nWe performed an ordinal logistic regression analysis and a chi-square test.",
        "results": "Results\nNegative Emotions and Social Support\nResults of the chi-square test indicated that there were significant differences in feelings of uselessness and loneliness between those who were still living with their spouse and those who were widowed (see Table 3). Likewise, with the exception of being in receipt of a government subsidy, there were significant differences between those still living with their spouse and those who were widowed in terms of formal and informal social support received.\nAssociations Between Social Support and Negative Emotions\nUsing SPSS software, we ran six ordinal logistic regression analyses (three for widowed and three for living with spouse) to explore the associations between social support and negative emotions in the respondent group. Results indicated that for formal social support (see Table 4), medical insurance was positively and significantly associated with feelings of uselessness among those who were widowed. Further, endowment insurance and community service were significantly and negatively associated with loneliness among respondents who were living with their spouse. As for informal social support, care when sick was significantly and negatively associated with all three negative emotions among those who were widowed. Further, daily chat was significantly and negatively associated with loneliness for both groups, and with anxiety among the group still living with their spouse. The better the care available when sick and the more they could chat with their children, the fewer negative emotions the respondents had. The more economic support their children provided, the more useless they felt. Overall, excluding economic support and medical insurance, the more informal and formal social support older adults received, the fewer negative emotions they felt.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nUsing data from the CLHLS-2018, we assessed the associations between social support and the negative emotions of uselessness, loneliness, and anxiety among Chinese people aged 65 years and over, by comparing groups according to whether they had been widowed or were living with their spouse. With the exception of economic support and medical insurance, the more informal and formal social support people received, the fewer negative emotions they had.\nFurther analysis revealed care received when ill and being widowed was the only significant influencing combination of factors that simultaneously predicted feelings of uselessness, loneliness, and anxiety, reflecting the emotional needs of those aged over 65 years who have been widowed. Specifically, the more care they received and the more often they could chat with their children, the fewer negative emotions the widowed respondents reported. It can be seen that for those aged 65 years and over who are widowed, having care available and chatting with their children may be important sources of informal social support. Family members are the closest companions of older adults and provide them with emotional support (Yin et al., 2020). Support from children, friends, and neighbors has a significant impact on the mental health of older adults (Wang & Zhai, 2018). Compared to noncaregivers, Xu (2019) found that grandparents who were caring for their grandchildren had better physical and mental health, fewer depressive symptoms, and lower blood pressure.\nIn China, as one formal type of social support, government medical subsidies play an important role in maintaining relatively low medical fees and in expanding medical treatment opportunities for patients, especially low-income and vulnerable groups (M. Chen & Wang, 2022). As the proportion of the population of China aged 65 years and over grows larger, the medical system will be increasingly unable to meet all their needs (J. Li et al., 2023). Thus, if widowed older people have generous medical insurance, they may feel useless because they are using up resources that are not sufficient to cater at that same level for the whole population. Furthermore, the more financial support received from their children by those aged over 65 years who still have a spouse, the more this will promote in them a sense that they are old and useless. They may feel that they not only do not provide economic support to their children, but drag them down. The mortality rate for those aged 65 years and over is higher for those with a strong sense of uselessness than it is for those who feel less useless (Zhu et al., 2023). The mechanism of the relationship between feeling useless and death is still uncertain. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out public health interventions for elders to promote a positive view of aging.\nThere are several limitations in our study. First, selecting only a few variables to represent formal and informal social support may have led to biased results. Second, the self-reported measures of uselessness, loneliness, and anxiety used to evaluate negative emotions may not be comprehensive enough. Despite these limitations, our findings provide valuable insight into the heterogeneous impact of social support.\nThe impacts of informal and formal social support on negative emotions were heterogeneous. For those respondents who were widowed, formal social support was significantly associated with feelings of uselessness; for those still living with their spouse, formal social support was associated with loneliness. For both those who had been widowed and those who still had a spouse, informal social support was significantly associated with feelings of uselessness, loneliness, and anxiety. With the exception of economic support and medical insurance, the more informal and formal social support received by those aged 65 years and over, the fewer negative emotions they felt. We note that older people who have been widowed should receive more care from their children, friends, and neighbors when they are sick, as care while they are ill was the only significant influencing factor in this study that predicted all three negative emotions for the people aged 65 years and over who had been widowed.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Nanhu Scholars Program for Young Scholars of Xinyang Normal University, the Henan Provincial Philosophy and Social Sciences Planning Annual Project (2022BDJ017), and the Project of the Research Center for Aging and Industrial Development at the Key Research Base of Social Sciences in Sichuan Province (XJLL2023025).\nThe authors are grateful for the help they received from Xinyang Normal University.\nHua Tian and Jie Chen wrote the main manuscript text and prepared all tables.

        "abstract": "As the threat of climate change looms large, and we experience first-hand the impacts of rapid global warming, researchers and clinicians emphasize the need to better understand the impact of these changes on our mental health. Existing research suggests that coping with and emotional reactions to climate change can promote action to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change and reduce its negative impacts to one's mental health. In this pre-registered study (N = 771) we examined whether people who display extreme intergenerational concern would also constructively cope with climate change. Empirically-identified individuals showing high intergenerational concern reported more problem-focused and meaning-based coping, and less avoidant coping strategies with climate change. Further, even though they felt guilty, angry, sorrowful and isolated, these individuals also felt hopeful about the future. These effects were explained by increased concerns about one's legacy and higher access to environmental cognitive alternatives. By instilling values that highlight intergenerational concern as a key priority, we could thus not only increase pro-climate action, but also help individuals actively and constructively cope with changes produced by climate change.\nKeywords: Coping, Emotions, Climate change, Legacy, Environmental cognitive alternatives\nAuthor(s): Stylianos Syropoulos1,2 , Kyle Fiore Law3 , Andrea Mah4 and Liane Young1\nAs climate threats reach unprecedented heights [1-4], a growing consensus among researchers and clinicians underscores the pressing need to expand our perspective beyond physical environmental repercussions and recognize the impact of the ongoing climate crisis on the mental health and well-being of our global community [5-11]. Emerging research in this vein underscores the impact of climate change on mental health, but also that coping strategies and emotional reactions strongly predict pro-environmental engagement [12, 13]. Yet, the effects of climate change are projected only to intensify over time, with its most substantial consequences expected to profoundly shape the distant future of humanity [14-16]. The growing social movement and ethical philosophy of longtermism explicitly advocates for protecting the welfare of future generations [17-19], and nascent psychological inquiry into longtermism beliefs highlights that individuals with a strong sense of intergenerational concern tend to exhibit heightened pro-environmental attitudes and engagement [20-24].\nDrawing upon existing theory and evidence, we investigate whether individuals showing a high amount of intergenerational concern (1) cope with climate change more constructively and (2) emotionally respond with both more concern and hope relative to general population controls. We also explore whether legacy concerns [25] and the ability to generate cognitive alternatives to the current environmental status quo [26] mediate any noted effects of intergenerational concern on coping and emotional reactions to climate change.\nMeasuring intergenerational concern using the longtermism beliefs scale\nLongtermism refers to an ethical philosophy advocating equal concern for current and future generations [17-19, 27, 28] and a social movement with a modest but dedicated and rapidly expanding following [29-31]. Longtermist ideology is guided by three key principles: (1) expressing concern for the well-being of future generations, (2) acknowledging the vast potential of humanity if extinction risks are reduced, and (3) recognizing the current generation's capacity to shape a positive future for humankind. Thus, longtermism is very much synonymous with showing a large degree of intergenerational concern.\nDespite the longtermism movement being subject to numerous criticisms in the popular press [29, 32], the longtermism philosophy provides a structured framework for studying the psychological dynamics of intergenerational concern. Emerging research in this vein from social psychology and cognitive science has employed the Longtermism Beliefs Scale (LBS) [22], which leverages items derived directly from eminent philosophical writings concerning longtermist principles [18, 19] to better understand the psychological antecedents and consequences of endorsing them. A significant portion of this research employs a scoring approach to categorize participants into two distinct subject groups: \"longtermists,\" who show substantial levels of intergenerational concern for both near and distant future generations, and general population controls, who either do not show above average levels of intergenerational concern or exhibit a declining level of concern for future generations as the timeframe under consideration extends further into the future [22-24, 33, 34]. In essence, empirically classified longtermists show a marked departure from the prevailing tendency displayed by most individuals [35-39] to consistently undervalue the well-being of future generations.\nThe psychological and pro-environmental profiles of intergenerational concern\nLongtermists empirically identified through the LBS exhibit not only a greater likelihood of self-identifying with the longtermism philosophy, but also a robust profile characterized by intergenerational concern, prosocial tendencies, and farsighted attitudes and behaviors [22, 33]. For instance, longtermists exhibit greater moral consideration for the welfare of individuals in distant future generations and also extend their moral concern to present-day outgroups relative to controls, ascribing to them elevated human-like capacities and characteristics [20, 24]. To further corroborate the connection between longtermism beliefs and prosocial tendencies, we can turn to the literature on moral expansiveness and dehumanization. A substantial body of literature has established a relationship between possessing a broad moral circle and reduced dehumanization tendencies with prosocial inclinations that surpass the typical parochial biases often constraining prosociality in the broader population [40-46]. Relatedly, longtermists demonstrate heightened levels of expansive altruism that extend across social distance and elevated utilitarian decision-making. Longtermist personality profiles are characterized by patterns of traits on the BIG-5 and HEXACO inventories [47, 48] as well as on measures of Dark Tetrad traits [47, 49, 50] and Primal World Beliefs [51], which are strongly aligned [52, 53] with prosocial behavior [22-24, 33, 34]. In terms of behaviors, longtermists, when compared to members of the general population, tend to make larger donations to charities benefitting future generations, show more support for farsighted public policies, and are more inclined to invest cognitive effort for the betterment of future generations [22, 34].\nHowever, beyond demonstrating consistent patterns of heightened intergenerational and present-day prosocial attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, longtermists also exhibit consistent patterns of pro-environmental attitudes and both top-down and bottom-up pro-environmental engagement. Compared to non-longtermists in the general population, individuals identified as longtermists through high scores on the LBS display stronger support for pro-environmental public policies in general and initiatives advocating climate justice for future generations and present-day minoritized groups more specifically [21]. They additionally report heightened threat perceptions of issues related to climate change, participate in more pro-climate actions in their daily lives, and contribute larger donations to pro-environmental causes in the laboratory [22, 23]. Similar to how they extend moral regard across social and temporal boundaries, longtermists extend greater moral consideration to entities within the natural environment as well, including non-human animals, rainforests, and coral reefs [20, 24], providing further support for the connection between substantial levels of intergenerational concern and pro-environmentalism.\nThe pro-environmental tendencies of longtermists are, in part, explained by their increased ability to envision a more sustainable future and generate a greater variety of environmental alternatives compared to non-longtermists [21]. These factors are closely linked to pro-environmental engagement in the broader population as well [26, 54-56]. These findings may reflect a heightened imaginative capacity in longtermists to transcend the here and now and more vividly represent distal futures in the mind's eye (see Episodic Future Thinking [57-60]). Moreover, longtermists exhibit elevated concerns about their own futures, specifically with regard to leaving behind a positive legacy [20-22, 34], another factor long recognized as a crucial motivator for environmental action [25, 35, 36, 61-63].\nLongtermist beliefs (i.e., endorsing a sense of impartial intergenerational beneficence) and pro-environmental behavior may be informed by extant literature on generative concern. People who are worried about the well-being of future generations are considered to be high in generative concern [64, 65]. Researchers have linked generative concern to environmentalism, finding that emerging adults who score high on measures of generative concern at ages 23 and 26 reported stronger environmental identity, as well as greater pro-environmental attitudes and engagement in pro-environmental behavior at age 32 [64]. Further, when these emerging adults exhibited increased growth in generative concern between ages 23-32, they were more likely to share narratives about their environmental identity which were coded as being more personally meaningful, detailed, and having a stronger influence on their commitment to continued environmental involvement [66]. In other work, people who scored high in generativity were also more likely to report environmental concern and green purchasing behavior [67]. However, generativity, as measured in these studies and other work on generative concern using the Loyola Generativity Scale (LGS [65], ), can be distinguished from longtermism because it includes more than intergenerational concern. The LGS contains sixteen items, but only three of these items measure beliefs about the impacts one can have on others after their death (i.e., in the long term), along with other items measuring commitments to others, creativity, and desire to mentor children [65]. Thus, while we expect that longtermism will exhibit similar relationships to environmentalism as generativity, studying the specific influence of intense intergenerational concern is important.\nHowever, despite extensive research examining the connection between intergenerational concern and climate-related attitudes and actions, a crucial and unanswered question remains: Do individuals with substantial levels of intergenerational concern cope with and emotionally react differently from members of the general population to escalating threats associated with climate change? The theoretical foundations underlying and emerging research into the psychology of longtermism hints at this possibility. For instance, longtermists actively take actions in their lives to (1) combat climate related threats [21, 34] and (2) safeguard the welfare of future generations [20-24, 34]. These findings allude to the possibility that longtermists may employ more proactive rather than avoidant coping strategies when dealing with climate change-related distress, taking practical steps to manage and mitigate the source of their concerns [5-7, 9].\nLikewise, longtermists' elevated pro-environmental engagement may be owed in part to their emotional reactions to climate change. For instance, it's plausible that longtermists may encounter heightened negative emotions such as anxiety, anger, or guilt (see [8, 68]), when faced with climate-related challenges and when reflecting on the legacies they will leave behind. These negative emotions, in turn, could serve as a driving force behind their proactive engagement and action-oriented approach to addressing climate-related issues. Yet, longtermists also have the capacity for elevated optimism when looking towards the future, as evidenced by their ability to envision more sustainable environmental alternatives [69]. This observation could provide insight into why potentially negative emotional responses to climate change do not lead to hopelessness or avoidance, but instead drive action among individuals with substantial levels of intergenerational concern. Nonetheless, since a comprehensive study directly comparing the climate change-related coping mechanisms and emotional responses of longtermists with those of the general population has not yet been conducted, these questions remain unanswered and warrant investigation. The extensive body of literature on coping strategies and emotional reactions in the context of climate change serves to supplement what is known from the burgeoning literature on intergenerational concern and longtermism beliefs in guiding the present research.\nCoping with and emotional reactions to climate change\nCoping refers to the different behavioral and cognitive strategies people use to deal with stress [70]. When we refer to coping with climate change, we are referring to the ways that people who feel worried about climate change respond to those feelings- whether they ignore the problem, express denial, and discount the threat (avoidant coping) or try to find ways to tackle the problem and directly engage with the issue (active coping). While we can broadly categorize coping strategies as being avoidant or active, researchers also describe coping based on its focus (e.g., meaning-focused, problem-focused, emotion-focused [70],. When we consider the stressors associated with climate change and the scale of the issue, it has been argued that successful coping will likely include a mix of strategies [71]- some strategies involving proenvironmental engagement, and some that help people to cope with their own emotional responses to the existential threat of climate change. For example, Ojala [9] found that, among youth, engaging in problem-focused active coping was associated with greater negative affect, but this relationship was attenuated when the youth also engaged in meaning-focused coping (e.g., positive reframing). The ways that people choose to cope with the threat of climate change have important implications for their own well-being and the environment. While it is important for people to find ways to manage their emotional responses to climate change, it is also necessary for people to take the actions that they can to address climate change through their own behavior [71].\nWhile work on the link between coping strategies to proenvironmental behavior is sparse, there is some evidence that people who report coping actively with climate change also report greater engagement with proenvironmental behaviors [72]. However, past work has also found that people who report using more avoidant strategies also engage in proenvironmental behaviors. As long as people are saying they are coping in some form, greater concern translates to behavior [72]. Ojala [73] found that adolescents who report greater meaning-focused coping are more likely to report greater pro-environmental behavior, and that those who reported more de-emphasizing coping (e.g., telling themselves the problem is over-exaggerated) were significantly less likely to report proenvironmental engagement. Although more research is needed on the link between coping and proenvironmental behavior, particularly work measuring proenvironmental behavior via observation, it seems likely that people who report greater coping with climate change, especially in more approach-oriented ways, are more likely to engage in proenvironmental behavior as a means managing their stress.\nFor longtermists, we might expect that concern about climate change, combined with propensity for prosociality, may lead to active forms of coping. Longtermists, namely, individuals who are exceptional in their intergenerational concern, feel a sense of responsibility to future generations; thus, we would expect that avoidant forms of coping, like denial or disengagement with the issue, would be contrary to their values. In previous work, people who express greater concern for their legacy-having an impact on the future beyond their lifespan-tended to report greater engagement in active forms of coping with climate change, and more proenvironmental behavior [74]. These findings would lend support to a prediction that longtermists would be more likely to engage in active coping with climate change-related stress, because longtermists strongly endorse legacy motives [20-22, 34].\nAnother aspect of longtermism is the ability to generate environmental cognitive alternatives (ECAs). Having a sense of hope and optimism about the future and being able to imagine the possibility of humankind adapting to climate change is likely necessary to maintain long-term engagement with the issue of climate change and also to maintain personal well-being [54, 56]. Indeed, being able to make meaning in spite of the magnitude of climate change challenges attenuates the negative relationship between problem-focused coping and well-being [73]. People who express greater motivation to leave a positive legacy also report a greater sense of constructive hope about climate change, and less hope based in denial [74]. Thus, we would expect that, because they feel a greater sense of hope and less powerlessness, longtermists will be better able to generate ECAs than controls. It is likely also the case that people who are better able to imagine an alternative future in turn feel more power to achieve that future and thus feel greater hope.\nFinally, the stress and concern that people feel about climate change may take different forms: grief, anger, guilt and worry. While some level of emotional response is likely needed to motivate engagement with climate change, there is also evidence that, if these emotions are too strong, it could be maladaptive [75]. For example, eco-anxiety is associated with more pro-environmental behavior, but poorer mental health [76]. Anger often motivates collective action generally [77], and this has also been found when measuring eco-anger [78]. There are many different kinds of guilt a person can feel associated with climate change (e.g., a sense of collective guilt due to feeling complicit in a system that causes climate change vs. criticism of one's actions [79],. Inducing guilt about climate change can motivate action [80]. However, it has been theorized that, for certain people, feelings of guilt underlie a propensity to deny human-caused climate change [81]. Longtermists may feel both more anger about climate change-a perceived failure to safeguard the future-and more guilt from feeling complicit in the systems which cause climate change.\nMoreover, sadness about climate change, sometimes termed ecological grief, takes many forms [82]. One form of this grief is associated with concerns about anticipated losses, those that have not yet occurred but that are likely to without action [82, 83]. For longtermists, it is likely that one of the feelings they have about climate change is a sense of loss and grief for the future, as long as they believe it poses tangible existential risk. While we might expect that feelings of sadness and depression around climate change could lead to withdrawal from or avoidance of the issue, some research suggests that people who express greater eco-depression also engage in collective action around climate change [78]. One of the objectives of the present investigation is to better understand to what extent longtermists express each of these kinds of emotions.\nCurrent studies\nBuilding upon the aforementioned theoretical rationale and existing findings [20-24, 34], we hypothesize first and foremost, that longtermists will report significantly higher legacy concerns (H1), and a greater ability to generate environmental cognitive alternatives (H2), compared to non-longtermists in the general population. In addition, we hypothesize that, because climate change is itself an extinction risk, longtermists will feel more angry about inaction for climate change (H3a), less climate contempt-feelings of disregard for the issue of climate change (H3b), more hope/enthusiasm that climate change can be addressed (H3c), less powerlessness about the scope of the threat (H3d), more guilt about not doing enough to address climate change (H3e), as well as more anxiety resulting from (H3f), and sorrow regarding (H3g) climate change.\nImportantly, we have varied predictions regarding how longtermists versus general population controls will score on how isolated they feel from others regarding their opinion about climate change. On the one hand, it's possible that longtermists may, on account of climate change representing an extinction threat, perceive their care regarding climate change as being higher than average, and consequently feel greater isolation. On the other hand, longtermists may overestimate normative alignment with their own climate change attitudes and feel less isolation compared to general population controls as a result.\nFinally, because longtermists are more concerned about and more likely to take active steps to address climate change [21, 34], and because they seek to protect future generations [20-24, 34], we hypothesize that they will score higher on problem-focused (H3h) and meaning-focused (H3i) coping and lower on avoidant coping with climate change (H3j).\nExtending this hypothesis further, we expect that higher scores in legacy concerns and ability to generate environmental cognitive alternatives will relate to more climate change-related anger (H4a-H4b), less contempt (H5a-H5b), more climate hope/enthusiasm (H6a-H6b), less climate powerlessness (H7a-H7b), more climate guilt (H8a-H8b), more climate anxiety (H9a-H9b), more problem-focused coping (H10a-H10b), more meaning-focused coping (H11a-H11b), and less avoidant-coping (H12a-H12b). Finally, because of H1-H12, we also expect significant indirect effects of longtermism matching the aforementioned directional associations on climate emotions via higher legacy concerns and environmental cognitive alternatives as simultaneous mediators (H13). These hypotheses, together with all analytical decisions, were pre-registered on AsPredicted, https://aspredicted.org/JPK_Q37.

        "methodology": "Method\nAll experimental protocols were approved obtained IRB approval by Boston College Institutional Review Board, Protocol #12.064.01. All participants were informed about the study and then consented to participating in it. This was completed at the beginning of the survey.\nParticipants\nA total of 800 participants were recruited via Prolific, an online platform that allows participants to complete surveys in exchange for financial remuneration. Per our pre-registration protocol we removed participants who had duplicate IP addresses (N = 12) and participants who missed our attention check (a multiple choice question asking them to select a particular response; N = 17). A total of 771 participants remained (M age = 40.51, SD age = 13.45), of whom 385 (49.9%) were male, 369 (47.9%) female, 17 (2.2%) neither male nor female, 565 (73.2%) white, 116 (15.0%) Black or African American, and 38 (4.9%) Asian. The average perceived socioeconomic status (SES) was 5.02 (SD = 1.76) on a scale of 1-10, and the average political ideology was 3.29 (SD = 1.78) on a scale of 1-7, with higher scores reflecting stronger conservatism.\nMaterials and procedure\nMeasures were grouped based on their role (predictor, mediators, outcomes) and shown to participants in a randomized order.\nPredictor: longtermism beliefs\nLongtermism beliefs were captured with the 28-item (a = 0.97) Longtermism Beliefs Scale [22]. The scale consists of seven statements, which are repeated with reference to four different timeframes/timepoints (1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 years in the future). Scores are captured on slider scales ranging from 0 = strongly disagree- 100 = strongly agree. Per the proposed methodology, participants are classified as longtermists if they score above 75 for the closest temporal timeframe (1,000 years), and they have the same score, or higher for future timeframes (i.e., 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 years in the future).\nMediator: legacy concerns\nLegacy concerns were captured using three items from Zaval and colleagues [25], measured on 7-point Likert scale (a = 0.89).\nMediator: environmental cognitive alternatives\nEnvironmental cognitive alternatives (ECAS) were captured with 10 items (a = 0.93) from Wright and colleagues [26] measured on a 7-point Likert scale.\nOutcome: climate change coping\nThree different methods of coping with climate change were measured. These were problem-focused coping (a = 0.90), meaning-focused coping (a = 0.79), and avoidant coping (a = 0.87). These measures were taken directly or adapted from Ojala [9]. Each method of coping was measured with 5 items, each measured on a 7-point Likert scale. The full set of items can be found in the SOM.\nOutcome: climate change emotions\nOur goal was to capture a broadest possible array of emotional reactions to climate change, including both constructive emotional reactions with positive valence (e.g., hope) as well as reactions with a more negative valence (e.g., contempt). To that end, we utilized a tool that was recently developed by researchers to comprehensively assess the full breadth of possible emotional reactions to climate change (see [8]). Specifically, we measured climate change-related anger (a = 0.96), contempt (a = 0.94), hope/enthusiasm (a = 0.93), powerlessness (a = 0.84), guilt (a = 0.95), anxiety (a = 0.92), sorrow (a = 0.95), and isolation (a = 0.91), which span the spectrum of affective valence. Participants responded to four items per emotion on a 7-point Likert scale.\nBased on the aforementioned theoretical rationale, and our pre-registered expectation for a significant indirect effect of longtermism on the different coping methods and emotional reactions to climate change, we estimated several indirect effects with longtermist identification as the predictor (binary variable; 1 = longtermist, 0 = non-longtermist), legacy concerns and ECAS as parallel mediators, and each outcome of interest as the focal outcome in each model. We used the PROCESS Macro [84], Model 4 (mediation with parallel mediators), with 10,000 bootstrapped samples.\nIn all models (see Table 4), longtermist identification predicted significantly higher legacy concerns (b = 0.72, 95% C.I. [0.50, 0.94], R 2 = 0.05) and ECAS (b = 0.60, 95% C.I. [0.38, 0.82], R 2 = 0.04). Even after controlling for legacy concerns and ECAS, being a longtermist predicted significantly higher scores for problem-focused coping, anger, guilt, sorrow, and anxiety for climate change, and significantly lower scores for contempt and avoidant coping, suggesting that legacy concerns and ECAS only partially mediate the effect of longtermism for these outcomes. However, for meaning-based coping and hope, the effect of longtermism was not significant after including the mediators. In turn, higher legacy concerns and ECAS related to increased problem-focused and meaning-based coping, hope, guilt, anger, isolation, anxiety, and sorrow, while ECAS specifically also related to decreased avoidant coping, and contempt. For powerlessness, legacy concerns had a positive association while ECAs a negative. Finally, significant indirect effects for both legacy concerns and ECAS emerged for problem-focused and meaning-based coping, anger, hope, powerlessness, guilt, isolation, anxiety, and sorrow. ECAS also mediated the effect of longtermism for avoidant coping and contempt. Results were for the most part consistent after accounting for the aforementioned demographic covariates, as all indirect effects except for the effect via ECAS for avoidant coping, remained significant and in the same direction (see Table S3 in SOM).\nTable 4:\nIndirect effects test with longtermist identification as the exogenous variable, legacy concerns and ECAS as parallel mediators",
        "results": "Results\nAll analyses were conducted in SAS. Correlations were estimated with the proc corr command, t-tests with the proc ttest command, regression with the proc reg command, and indirect effect tests using the PROCESS Macro, with 10,000 bootstrapped samples.\nCorrelations\nAs hypothesized (see Table 1) higher longtermism beliefs related to increased legacy concerns and ECAs. Each of these three measures related to decreased avoidant coping, increased problem-focused and meaning-based coping with climate change. Coping styles that were actively acknowledging climate change and focused on ways to address the issue rather than avoid it, Longtermism beliefs, legacy concerns and ECAs related to increased hope, anger, guilt, anxiety, sorrow, isolation and decreased contempt. No significant association was found with powerlessness except for ECAs, which negatively related to powerlessness.\nTable 1:\nPearson's correlations between all measures\nDifferences based on longtermist identification\nOf the 771 participants, a total of 185 (24%) scored in the longtermist pattern, showing high intergenerational concern. Specifically, longtermists (M = 92.78, SD = 6.34) scored significantly higher (t (761.73) = 41.89, p <.001, d = 2.63) than the rest of the sample (M = 48.87, SD = 22.73) in longtermism beliefs, suggesting that they were considerably higher in their perception that future people deserve moral rights and that we can influence their lives. All results were robust to the inclusion of age, gender, socioeconomic status and political ideology as covariates (i.e., results remained significant and in the same direction). For these analyses, see the Supplementary Online Materials (SOM).\nMediators\nSupporting our hypothesis, longtermists scored significantly higher in legacy concerns and ECAS compared to non-longtermists (see Table 2; Fig. 1).\nFig. 1:\nPlots depicting legacy concerns (a ), and environmental cognitive alternatives (b ) for longtermists and general population controls.

Further, they expressed significantly less contempt. Contrary to our hypothesis, no significant difference was noted for powerlessness. For isolation, we had contrasting hypotheses. The results suggested that longtermists felt more isolation compared to controls, possibly due their elevated concern for the issue relative to the rest of the population (See Table 2; Fig. 2).\nFig. 2:\nPlots depicting anger (a ), guilt (b ), anxiety (c ), sorrow (d ), hope (e ), contempt (f ), powerlessness (g ), and isolation (h ) for longtermists and general population controls.

Importantly, these results remained significant, and in the same direction when controlling for age, gender, socioeconomic status and political ideology (see Table S2 in SOM).\nTable 3:\nLinear regressions with legacy concerns and ECAS as predictors of all focal outcomes\nIndirect effects",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nAs climate change-related threats become more pronounced [1-4], researchers are now extending their focus beyond the physical environment to examine their impact on the mental health of individuals within it [5-11]. This research highlights not only that climate change impacts mental health, but that resulting coping strategies and emotional reactions are a critical driver of pro-environmental engagement. Despite extensive research demonstrating that intergenerational concern, as assessed by high scores on the Longtermism Beliefs Scale (LBS) [22], correlates with pro-environmental engagement [23, 69] and forward-thinking attitudes and behaviors aimed at safeguarding the well-being of future generations [20-24, 34], the precise impact of intergenerational concern on coping strategies and emotional reactions to climate change remains a critically unexplored area of study [masked for review]. The present study represents a first pass at testing the novel hypothesis that intergenerational concern serves the adaptive function of not only promoting attitudes and actions towards mitigating the deleterious effects of climate change on the natural environment, but also promoting proactive coping strategies towards mitigating its adverse effects on psychological well-being.\nIn this study, we delved into the climate change-related coping strategies [5-7, 9] and emotional reactions [8, 68] of empirically-identified longtermists, individuals who exhibit exceptionally strong intergenerational concern. Our findings revealed that longtermists tend to employ problem-focused (i.e., directing one's effort and attention directly toward actively addressing the specific problem or stressor they are facing) and meaning-based (i.e., finding or creating meaning and purpose in difficult or challenging situations) coping strategies more frequently while relying less on avoidant coping strategies (i.e., engaging in efforts to distance oneself from a stressor) when confronted with climate change-related challenges. Intriguingly, despite experiencing emotions such as guilt, anger, sorrow, and a sense of isolation in response to climate change, longtermists also reported feeling a distinct sense of hope about the future, aligning with work which underscores the utility of emotional complexity in driving collective action [85].\nThe emotional responses we observed were in line with what we would expect for a group of people characterized by robust concern for the distant future. Having feelings about climate change (regardless of the valence) is indicative of involvement with the issue rather than avoidance. Longtermists care about the issue of climate change, and that care and concern manifest in their emotional engagement. While previous research has suggested that there is a level of emotional response needed to motivate action, experiencing worry too strongly could result in avoidance [75]. Yet, even among those who are experiencing strong negative emotions, maintaining a sense of hope and being able to make meaning represent one way of safeguarding well-being [73]. Longtermists appear to be especially good at maintaining hope. However, understanding how and why longtermists foster hope, and the intricate relationships between different emotions over time requires further study.\nThese observed patterns in coping and emotional responses were further elucidated by two key factors. First, longtermists' heightened concerns about the legacy they will leave behind played a crucial role in driving their problem-focused and meaning-based coping strategies. These findings align with an extensive body of literature linking legacy motivations to proenvironmental attitudes and action [25, 35, 36, 61, 61-63, 86, 87] as well as intergenerational concern [20-22, 34]. Yet the present findings build upon this existing literature by demonstrating that legacy motivations simultaneously mitigate the impact of climate change on well-being. Second, longtermists' enhanced ability to generate alternative solutions and perspectives regarding environmental issues, referred to as environmental cognitive alternatives (ECAs), contributed significantly to their positive outlook and adaptive coping mechanisms in the face of climate change. Similar to legacy motivations, ECAs have been shown to predict pro-environmental and otherwise farsighted attitudes and actions [26, 56]. Nonetheless, the present study is the first to connect this factor to climate-related coping and emotionality.\nIn summary, the present findings show that individuals with a strong sense of intergenerational concern experience a mix of emotions when it comes to climate change. They often grapple with feelings of anger, guilt, and anxiety in response to the climate crisis. However, in contrast to these negative emotions, they also maintain a sense of hope about the future, taking direct actions to address the challenges posed by climate change (problem-focused coping), actively engaging with the issue and seeking solutions. Simultaneously, they find meaning and purpose in their efforts, not losing faith in others or humanity as a whole (meaning-focused coping). Importantly, they do not resort to avoidant coping, which involves avoiding or ignoring the issue altogether. Instead, they confront climate change head-on, driven by their ability to envision of a more sustainable future and strong desire to leave behind a positive and lasting legacy. By instilling values that highlight intergenerational concern as a key priority, we may be able not only to increase pro-climate action, but also to help individuals actively and constructively cope with changes produced by climate change.\nLimitations and future directions\nWhile the current study represents an initial exploration of the positive relationship that intergenerational concern has with climate-related coping and emotional responses, it is important to acknowledge several limitations and areas that warrant further investigation and exploration. For instance, the analyses in the current study are correlational, which means that the directionality and causal nature of the relationships under examination remain subject to further investigation. On the one hand, it is possible that intergenerational concern precedes and influences coping strategies and emotional responses to climate change. It is equally plausible that individuals' coping mechanisms and emotional reactions to climate challenges may, in turn, shape the level of concern they feel toward safeguarding future generations from these threats. These potential causal relationships should be explored in future research that directly manipulates intergenerational concern. Previous research has demonstrated that low-cost and short-duration interventions can effectively promote intergenerational attitudes and actions [23, 34, 36, 61].\nFurthermore, future research could consider applying the current framework within a longitudinal context. Given that coping mechanisms are designed to alleviate negative emotional states, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the proactive coping strategies used by individuals with heightened intergenerational concern might effectively mitigate the feelings of anger, guilt, and anxiety they experience in response to climate challenges over time. Longitudinal studies could provide valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of coping and emotional reactions in relation to climate change. Notably, while this study has shed light on the connections between intergenerational concern, coping strategies, and emotional responses, it has yet to establish a direct link between coping mechanisms and climate actions. Future research endeavors may bridge this gap by investigating how specific coping strategies translate into concrete pro-environmental behaviors and actions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between emotional reactions, coping, and climate-related engagement.\nAnother area ripe for further investigation is the variance that persists between intergenerational concern and the outcomes. While our study has uncovered evidence suggesting that legacy concerns and environmental cognitive alternatives (ECAs) account for a portion of the variance in these relationships, there remains unexplained variance that calls for deeper exploration. Future research can explore additional factors and mechanisms that contribute to the complex relationship between intergenerational concern and outcomes related to coping and emotional reactions, offering a more comprehensive understanding of these dynamics.\nAs an example, longtermists exhibit heightened levels of future self-continuity, indicating a strong sense of identity with their future selves, and tend to carefully contemplate the consequences of their actions [88]. These variables are well-established predictors of forward-thinking behaviors aimed at safeguarding not only one's own future but also the future well-being of others [89-99, 99]. Moreover, longtermists engage in greater utopian thinking, and report a greater vividness when envisioning the distant future compared to general population controls, characteristics that contribute to intergenerational and pro-environmental concerns [20, 54, 55, 58, 59, 69]. Given the relevance of these additional factors, they merit consideration as candidate mechanisms that could help bridge the gap between intergenerational concern and coping strategies, as well as emotional reactions in the context of climate change.\nLastly, it's essential to acknowledge that the current study is based on a sample from the United States. Future research endeavors should aim to replicate and extend the findings presented here in an international context. Examining these relationships across diverse cultural and geographic settings may help uncover valuable insights into the universality or cultural specificity of the observed patterns, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of intergenerational concern and its implications for climate-related coping and emotional responses on a global scale. For instance, prior research has found that countries with cultures embodying a long-term orientation and with greater intergenerational solidarity score higher on numerous metrics of environmental performance [100]. Moreover, citizens of these countries are more concerned about the negative effects of climate change. What stands to be addressed in future research is whether national differences in temporal perspective predict variation in coping with and emotional reactions to climate change, in turn facilitating greater proenvironmental engagement.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusion\nClimate change impacts are already occurring but will be catastrophic for future generations without intervention. Longtermists, and those with high levels of intergenerational concern more broadly, represent a group of people who are particularly concerned about future generations. This intergenerational concern does not appear to paralyze them or prevent engagement with the issue; in fact, we find that longtermists are able to feel hopeful in spite of the challenges and engage in proactive coping strategies to address climate change.\nAcknowledgements: We have no acknowledgements to make.\nCorrespondence:\nAuthor details: 1 https://ror.org/02n2fzt79, grid.208226.c, 0000 0004 0444 7053, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Boston College, , Chestnut Hill, MA, USA. 2 https://ror.org/02n2fzt79, grid.208226.c, 0000 0004 0444 7053, The Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society, Boston College, , Chestnut Hill, MA, USA. 3 https://ror.org/012zs8222, grid.265850.c, 0000 0001 2151 7947, Department of Psychology, University at Albany, State University of New York Albany, , Albany, NY, USA. 4 https://ror.org/0072zz521, grid.266683.f, 0000 0001 2166 5835, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst, , Amherst, MA, USA.",

        "introduction": "Background\nGlobally, an estimated 14% of adults live with migraine disease which impacts their physical, emotional and social wellbeing. To target the disease comprehensively, research recommends a multidisciplinary approach to migraine management. Yet, at present, migraine management primarily centers around pharmaceutical treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which emotional awareness could influence the uptake of self-care behaviours of community-dwelling adults with migraine.\nBackground\nChronic pain, defined as pain that persists or recurs for longer than three months [1], affects a quarter of the UK population [2]. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 recognised the high prevalence of pain and pain-related disease as a major contributor to disability and disease burden worldwide [3]. Chronic pain has been shown to have a significant impact on people's overall quality of life [4].This significant impact can also be found in headache disorders, which are among the most common diseases worldwide. Migraine, a primary headache disorder, is one of the leading causes of years lived with disability among adults [5]. The estimated global prevalence of migraine is 14% in adults [6]. Aside from debilitating physical symptoms, migraine has a significant impact on a person's daily functioning, quality of life, social and emotional wellbeing, employment and family life [7-10].\nOver the past century, our understanding of and perspective on chronic pain has shifted from a biomedical perspective which regards pain as an objective physical event, to a biopsychosocial perspective which considers the interplay of physiological, psychological, social, cognitive and behavioural factors present in an individual's pain experience [11]. While certain contributing factors in chronic pain are deemed non-modifiable (i.e., age, sex, history of trauma or injury, or heritable/genetic factors) other modifiable contributing factors play an important role including pain, mental health, physical activity, sleep and nutrition [12]. In addition to genetic predisposition, behavioural and psychological traits may adversely affect the progression of the disease and how pain is processed [13]. Self-management behaviours and lifestyle modification targeting sleep, diet, stress or the work environment could offer a significant contribution to the experience and trajectory of chronic pain [12, 13]. Migraine is often influenced by comorbidities such as back pain, anxiety and depression or diabetes, as well as individual psychological characteristics. A management approach addressing migraine and simultaneously comorbidities is considered to positively impact the outcome on the individual's health status. However, also in individuals free of psychiatric comorbidities, specific behavioural and psychological factors might occur which need to be addressed for improved management [14, 15].\nInternationally, guidelines for migraine treatment support this multidisciplinary approach, which includes a combination of acute and preventative pharmacological treatment, lifestyle modification and the use of evidence-based behavioural interventions [16, 17]. The routine use of these self-care techniques and behavioural interventions in headache management is low due to factors such as missing knowledge among healthcare professionals [18]. Additionally, headache patients consider behavioural interventions only suitable for those who have previously not benefited from pharmacological treatment options or have high-severity symptoms [18]. Across migraine management, the sustained adoption and adherence to lifestyle or behavioural modifications, including nutrition or use of medication, pose challenges [19, 20]. To address this, several dimensions of self-care which act on the health system level and individual need to be considered, which can be broadly grouped into [1] self-care activities (self-awareness, health literacy) and [2] self-care behaviours (delivery, activation, and behaviour change) [21]. In the case of migraine, as with the management of other chronic conditions, self-care activities and behaviours are primarily centred around physical symptoms of pain, whereas behaviours including a doctor's visit or taking a pill are considered to be responses to physical pain [22].\nFrom the biopsychosocial perspective of chronic pain, this one-sided approach lacks the integration of emotional and social factors and the influence this would have on the choice of self-care activities and behaviours which should be present to address acute and non-pain situations. Using personal mood and emotion-tracking smartphone applications can increase an individual's emotional awareness [23]. In the case of migraine sufferers, using mood diaries and emotion tracking could help them become more aware of their emotions and would be more likely to react to them using self-management approaches. Available support for self-management of migraine, including the use of headache- or migraine-tracking apps, follow this approach but traditionally favour the tracking of physical symptoms of migraine over the impact of emotions in their assessment [24, 25]. Further, while these apps may enhance the recording of and the user's reflection on emotions, they do not routinely provide guidance for behavioural responses to emotions and social situations [26].\nStudy objectives\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the perceived efficacy of preventative and acute self-care techniques currently used by migraine patients. We also sought to examine the extent to which emotional factors are integrated into the choice or management of migraine.",
        "methodology": "Methods\nA cross-sectional online survey explored personal experiences with migraine disease and strategies or behaviours to manage migraine attacks. Chi-squared tests were used to investigate differences in ratings of migraine prevention and management strategies between users and non-users of the strategies. Univariable logistic regressions were used to assess the effectiveness of self-care behaviours to manage or prevent migraine attacks.\nMethods\nStudy design\nWe conducted a descriptive cross-sectional online survey of migraine sufferers using purposive sampling. The electronic survey published on the Imperial College London Qualtrics platform was open for 8 months (July 2021 to February 2022) and could be accessed by anyone with the link. Information about the study was shared with migraine charities as well as through the personal networks of the co-investigators. Initial contact was not made with respondents prior to this email. Study information inviting individuals to contribute to a study that investigated the extent to which emotional awareness influences self-care behaviours of adults with migraine was disseminated, including the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and link to the survey. Inclusion criteria were only validated in the survey asking participants if they had migraine disease. We did not specify diagnosis by a neurologist or self-diagnosis nor a specific type of migraine as exclusion criteria. The researchers' personal and professional networks were also mobilised to respond and further disseminate the eSurvey among eligible participants. The PIS included information regarding the study's aims, the protection of participants' personal data, their right to withdraw from the study at any time, which data were stored, where and for how long, who the investigator was, and the purpose of the study and survey length. Participants were informed that this was a voluntary survey without any monetary incentives. We highlighted that their participation offered collective benefits by advancing knowledge in the area. We offered participants access to the study findings at a later stage.\nElectronic survey\nThe Qualtrics survey (Version XM) contained a total of 26 questions displayed on one page. The Qualtrics website has first-party cookies and allows third parties to place cookies on devices and automatically capture responses. The survey was accessible using a personal computer or smartphone to anyone with a link (open survey). Questions regarding the demographic characteristics of the users included information on gender, age, ethnicity, educational level, marital status, country of residence and employment status. Participants could review their answers before submitting them. All data collected through the survey were anonymised and not personally identifiable. The online survey's technical functionality and usability were tested and piloted with a small group of individuals before being published. Participation in the survey was voluntary, and consent to participate in the study was sought in the first question of the survey.\nThe survey contained conditional questions that appeared if the respondent stated they track their emotional and/or physical wellbeing and symptoms so that they could input further information about their personal experiences. Single-choice questions evaluated the participants' experience with migraine disease (e.g., frequency or type). Personal self-care techniques for migraine attack prevention and acute management were evaluated in multiple-choice questions with common self-care techniques as suggested answer options. Participants were asked to state the extent to which they thought the listed self-care techniques were effective. Additional questions explored the participants' perception of how emotional wellbeing was related to their migraine disease and its management and whether they tracked their physical and emotional wellbeing. The survey is included in Supplementary File 1.\nData handling\nThe data collected were stored on the password-protected Imperial College London secure database, and only the team researchers could access the eSurvey results. Data were cleaned to exclude respondents who did not provide tick-box consent, or who exited without submitting their response. Non-submitted responses were excluded as these lacked answers to key questions on participant demographics and experience, prevention, or management of migraines. IP addresses of survey responses indicated no duplicated participants.\nStatistical analysis\nRespondent characteristics were described using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and median with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables. Chi-squared tests were conducted to explore potential associations between ratings of each prevention and management strategy and being a user of the strategy. The Holm correction for multiple tests was applied to the resulting p -values of statistical tests. An adjusted p -value < 0.05 denoted statistical significance. All analyses were performed using R version 4.1.2. The quality of the survey was assessed by completing the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) [27].\nEthics\nThe study received a favourable opinion from Imperial College Research Ethics Committee (ICREC # 21IC6990). Participants consented to take part in the survey.\nPatient and public involvement\nNo patient was involved.\nPertinently, such phenotyping of patients can help in designing efficient clinical trials. For example, a patient who is already keeping a diary may not need to be randomized into a self-management intervention which utilizes such methods, and this may help streamline recruitment into the trial.\nImplications\nThe survey analysis suggested that migraine management is currently focused on pharmaceutical interventions and lifestyle changes such as staying hydrated. The aspect of emotional wellbeing is less integrated into patients' current coping and management strategies. However, mental health interventions are subjectively perceived as helpful by respondents, which allows the assumption that awareness is given. Future research would need to explore how this gap between awareness and actual implementation of e.g., mental health support in migraine management arises and how it can be overcome.",
        "results": "Results\nWe surveyed 170 community-dwelling adults with migraine in the United Kingdom, Austria, Germany and the United States. Most (85%) respondents had experienced migraine for over five years, where 42% of attacks usually lasted several days. Whereas we did not differentiate between diagnosis by a neurologist or self-diagnosis, the most common diagnoses in the cohort were migraine without aura (38.9%) and migraine with aura (29%). Staying hydrated was the most popular preventative strategy (87%), 70.2% used prescription medication and 64.9% changed their diet and/or supplements. Almost all ( 92.4%) respondents stated that their mood or emotions could trigger their migraine attacks. Keeping a headache or mood diary was the lowest-rated prevention strategy and was rated as \"probably ineffective\" or causing \"no change\" in preventing migraine attacks. Over a third (39.7%) kept track of their physical wellbeing and symptoms. Reasons stated for tracking symptoms included to identify triggers (65.8%), show reports to a healthcare professional (59.6%), understand when they must take medication (48.1%), track improvements (67.3%) or deteriorations (67.3%).\nResults\nDemographic profile of respondents\nThe electronic survey received 170 total responses. Only 131 (77.1%) of the total responses were complete, emanating from the United Kingdom (84.0%), Germany (2.3%), Austria (1.5%) and the United States (12.2%); Table 1. The majority (92.4%) of respondents were female. Respondents had a median age of 39 years (IQR 29 - 51) with a range of 18 to 74 years. Eighty-three percent were educated to a university degree or higher, and 60.3% were employed. More than half (51.9%) were married, 20.6% were in a domestic relationship, and 17.6% were single. The majority (90.8%) identified as white ethnic background.\nTable 1:\nRespondent characteristics\nMigraine characteristics and impact\nEighty-nine percent of respondents had experienced migraine for over five years. Whereas 26% of respondents experienced migraine once or twice per week, 26% once or twice per month, and 3.8% once or twice per year, 44.3% indicated they had chronic migraine (15 + days per month). At the time of survey completion, 77.1% of respondents had experienced their last migraine attack during the last seven days. Migraine attacks usually lasted several days (42.0%), the whole day (35.9%), or over an hour (19.8%). The most common diagnoses in the cohort were migraine with no aura (38.9%) and migraine with aura (29.0%). A quarter (25.2%) indicated they had been diagnosed with a different migraine type or that they did not know the type of migraine they experienced. Respondents were asked to rate on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 is no effect, and 5 is an extreme effect, the extent to which migraine affected their physical, emotional and social wellbeing. An extremely detrimental effect on physical wellbeing with a score of 4 or more was most frequently reported (73.3%), compared to 64.9% for social wellbeing and 59.5% for emotional wellbeing.\nMigraine prevention\nRespondents were divided into \"users\" (Fig. 1) and \"non-users\" (Fig. 2) of each migraine prevention activity based on whether or not they had indicated they used the activity for the prevention of migraine attacks and maintenance of physical and emotional wellbeing. Users of each prevention strategy generally rated them more positively than non-users, except for \"Headache Diary\" which was viewed as ineffective by both users and non-users. Table 2 shows the subjective ratings of all prevention strategies in more detail.\nFig. 1:\nRating of prevention strategies from users. Figure 1 shows the subjective rating of prevention strategies from those who actively use the strategy (= users)\nFig. 2:\nRating of prevention strategies from non-users. Figure 2 shows the subjective rating of prevention strategies from those who have never used or have stopped using the strategy (= non-users)\nTable 2:\nRating of prevention strategies stratified by users and non-users of the strategy\nThe most popular migraine prevention strategy was 'staying hydrated', with 87% of respondents selecting that they partake in the strategy (Fig. 1). The next most popular prevention strategies, in descending order, were taking prescription medication (70.2% of 131 respondents selected), diet changes and/or supplements (64.9%), using migraine relief products (63.4%), and lifestyle adaptations such as regular breaks or avoiding screen time (80%).\nStaying hydrated was the highest-rated strategy by its users with nearly 94% describing it as \"probably effective\". The next best-rated prevention strategies by user rating were lifestyle adaptations and exercise, with 91.3% and 89% of their respective users rating them as \"probably effective\". Keeping a mood diary (3.1%) was the least frequently selected strategy for the prevention of migraine attacks. Keeping a headache or mood diary was the lowest rated (\"probably ineffective\") prevention strategy amongst both users and non-users of the strategies (Figs. 1 and 2).\nAlthough mental health support \"Counselling, Cognitive behavioural therapy, other mental health support\" was the second least frequently selected strategy for migraine prevention (15.3%), it was highly rated by its users, with 75% of respondents who used this strategy (n = 20) describing it as \"probably effective\" at preventing migraine.\nAcute migraine management strategies\nRespondents were divided into \"users\" (Fig. 3) and \"non-users\" (Fig. 4) for each migraine management activity based on whether they used the activity to manage signs and symptoms of migraine when they occur. Most management strategies were rated positively by users, whereas non-users were more often doubtful as to the effectiveness of each strategy. Table 3 shows the subjective ratings of all prevention strategies in more detail.\nFig. 3:\nRating acute management strategies from users. Figure 3 shows the subjective rating of acute management strategies from those who actively use the strategy (= users)\nFig. 4:\nRating acute management strategies from non-users. Figure 4 shows the subjective rating of acute management strategies from those who have never used or have stopped using the strategy (= non-users)\nTable 3:\nRating of acute management strategies stratified by users and non-users of the strategy\nThe most popular acute management strategies by several users were 'staying hydrated' and 'use of migraine relief products', with both being used by 104 (79.4% of 131) users. Taking prescription medication was also popular, with 74.8% of respondents selecting it as a management strategy.\nStaying hydrated and taking prescription medication were the most highly rated management strategies, with 82.7% and 82.7% of their respective users rating them as \"probably effective\" at managing signs and symptoms of migraine in that same order. Using a mood diary to manage signs and symptoms of migraine attacks was the least popular strategy, with only 4 (3.1%) respondents selecting it. Exercise and OTC medication received the highest proportion of \"probably ineffective\" ratings of all management strategies as rated by non-users, users of the strategies much more positively, with 71.9 and 70.9% rating them as \"probably effective\", respectively.\nSelf-tracking of wellbeing and symptoms\nTwenty-two respondents (16.8%) tracked both their physical and emotional wellbeing, whereas 73 (55.7%) stated they neither tracked their physical nor emotional wellbeing and symptoms.\nOver a third (39.7%) of respondents stated they kept track of their physical wellbeing and symptoms. Respondents used the data they collected about their physical wellbeing and symptoms to identify triggers (65.8%), show reports to a healthcare professional (59.6%), understand when they must take medication (48.1%), track improvements (67.3%), or to track deteriorations (67.3%).\nNearly all (92.4%) respondents stated that their mood or emotions could be a trigger for their migraine attacks.\nMood or emotions were a trigger most or all of the time for 36.6% of respondents. Less than a quarter (19.1%) of 131 respondents stated they keep track of their emotional wellbeing and symptoms. Respondents that tracked emotional symptoms often tracked physical symptoms - 88% of respondents who tracked their emotional wellbeing and symptoms also tracked their physical wellbeing and symptoms, but only 42.3% of respondents who tracked their physical wellbeing and symptoms also tracked their emotional wellbeing and symptoms.\nRespondents used the data they collected about their emotional wellbeing and symptoms to identify triggers (76%), show reports to a healthcare professional (44%), understand when they have to improve their emotional wellbeing (72%), track improvements (52%), and track deteriorations (13%). Migraine duration, frequency, and type were not found to be associated with the likelihood of tracking emotional wellbeing and symptoms.",
        "discussion": "Discussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that sought to understand the perceived efficacy of preventative and acute self-care techniques currently used by migraine patients, and to examine the extent that emotional factors are integrated into choice or management of migraine. The overall aim of the paper was to investigate the extent that emotional awareness influences self-care behaviours of community-dwelling adults with migraine.\nKey findings\nFocus on physical symptoms\nFindings revealed that participants rated the impact of migraine to be similar on their physical, emotional, and social wellbeing, but this was not reflected in their choice of prevention and acute migraine management strategies, which are mainly focused on treating physical symptoms. The most popular choices of those strategies were staying hydrated or taking prescription medication. This is consistent with the findings of Probyn et al., (2017), which showed that non-pharmacological self-management interventions for migraine are more effective than usual care and in reducing pain intensity, mood and headache-related disability.\nA hypothesis to explain the more positive rating of strategies by users compared to non-users is the difficulty of understanding a strategy's value if you have never used it yourself. Additionally, non-users could consider these strategies as an additional burden to their management.\nBehavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have been shown to be effective in reducing pain, distress, pain behaviour in chronic pain patients and in improving daily functioning [1, 2]. Although in our study only 20 participants reported using mental health support including CBT as a strategy for migraine prevention, it was highly rated as 'probably effective' by users of this self-management technique. Matsuzawa et al. [3] previously explored the barriers to behavioural treatment (e.g., biofeedback, CBT, relaxation techniques) adherence which could be a barrier for the existing target group as well. Further because migraine is known to arise from an interaction between biological, psychological and lifestyle factors, migraine disease puts a physiological and psychological strain on those affected. Psychological factors in particular might aggravate the disease progression, exposing individuals affected to a negative cycle [13].\nBarriers to interventions\nDespite the promising efficacy of behavioural interventions which had fewer side effects than pharmacological treatment, a key barrier to the uptake and adherence to behavioural interventions was related to attitudes and beliefs towards the interventions [3]. Another barrier highlighted was the lack of knowledge or unawareness of headache triggers which could be grouped into a number of categories as follows: [1] 'avoidable' triggers (e.g., alcohol); [2] 'unavoidable and unmanageable' triggers (e.g., weather); and [3] 'unavoidable but manageable' triggers (e.g. stress). Monitoring and managing triggers could help patients increase their headache control which in turn can lead to improved treatment adherence [3].\nRosignoli et al. (2022) [13] highlight that a biopsychosocial approach that considers psychological mechanisms, social and lifestyle factors in addition to biological factors, is already widely used in chronic pain management. However, in migraine management the biomedical approach is dominant. A potential barrier to adopting the approach is the incomplete knowledge of migraine pathophysiology. Additionally, the variability of behavioural interventions for each individual is higher than in pharmacological solutions, leading to difficulty in measuring their effectiveness. The high prevalence of migraine would demand a high level of resources which in the current healthcare system cannot be provided to all individuals with migraine who would require them.\nA recent study from the German Migraine and Headache Society (DMKG) highlighted that headaches show higher impact in individuals with a low socioeconomic status which needs to be further considered in the selection and availability of new management solutions [28].\nUse of a diary to monitor/help prevent migraine\nPertinently, a diary to monitor mood and physical symptoms (e.g., Headache or symptoms) was only used by 67/170 (39.4%) of respondents and this self-care strategy was rated as 'probably effective' by only 35.8% of diary users. Conversely, the use of mood diaries for the prevention of migraine attacks was the least used strategy with only four respondents rating the effectiveness as either 'probably ineffective' or 'no change'. A clear focus is put on tracking physical symptoms, improving one's understanding of emotional or mood factors influencing pain is uncommon and not considered to be an effective management strategy. The recommended biopsychosocial approach to chronic pain, including migraine, management, aims to address physiological as equally psychological, social, cognitive and behavioural factors in a patient's pain experience [4]. Physiological elements are usually managed primarily and tracked in headache diaries by a large number of migraine patients. Mood diaries could further support the biopsychosocial treatment approach by helping patients to learn about mood patterns, hence, being actively able to act to improve their mood [5]. Based on our study findings, we identified that only some diary users consider diaries to be 'probably effective'. However, we did not define what 'probably effective' means in detail for a migraine diary. We can assume that participants rated the strategy in how it was effectively contributing to their migraine management. We cannot draw a conclusion as to whether users find diaries effective in learning about mood patterns. An in-depth analysis is needed to confirm this. An implication for clinical practice would be to use combined diaries that include mood and symptom tracking and show their relationship in summarised reports. This might help patients but also clinicians to understand challenge areas which could be e.g. emotional stressors.\nLimitations\nThe principal limitation of this survey was that 92.4% of survey respondents were women. A reason for this unbalanced gender distribution might be the prevalence of migraine, which current literature shows to be three to four times higher in women than in men. A larger sample in future studies will be important to understand if this effect is due to the sample size instead.\nOverall, the number of participants does not allow for conclusive statements on whether the lack of use of mood diaries and the belief that they are ineffective correlates with a low number of users of mental health services. While many factors such as availability or cost will impact the choice of interventions, a potential area for further investigation is how increased emotional awareness (through e.g., the use of mood diaries) would influence the use of mental health support in migraine prevention and acute management.\nAnother key limitation of this study is related to the small sample size, but it is generally difficult to recruit for such community-facing studies unless migraine patients are approached via the healthcare provider.\nFurther, a convenience sampling strategy was used because we were unsure how many migraine sufferers would respond to the survey. Given that most studies fail because they are unable to recruit the desired sample, convenience sampling was chosen due to its accessibility and time efficiency and this approach is particularly useful for reaching specific groups online, such as migraine communities, and is well-suited for exploratory studies or when resources are limited. As such, we did not seek to perform a power calculation but instead recruited a pragmatic sample primarily due to the exploratory nature of the research, constraints in resources and time, and the need for real-world applicability. This approach allowed for broader inclusivity and greater feasibility, especially in preliminary investigations or when studying novel topics where effect sizes are uncertain. While this decision prioritizes practicality and real-world relevance, we acknowledge that this does not consider potential trade-offs in statistical precision and generalizability. Despite this limitation, we felt that using a pragmatic sample was justifiable given the aims and nature of our study.\nTo enhance the usability of the survey, self-care interventions were grouped within answer options. Follow-up explorations of individual interventions would be necessary. Also, users of prevention/management strategies are likely users because they have found that those strategies work for them. Non-users may be composed of both those who have never tried the strategy and those who have tried the strategy in the past and found it did not work for them and, hence, do not currently use the strategy.\nAdditional focus needs to be placed on the migraine frequency and how it relates to the acceptance of (new) self-care techniques. The burden of migraine disease can differ significantly depending on the frequency of migraine attacks. 3.8% of our respondents experienced migraine attacks once or twice per year whereas 44.3% indicated they had chronic migraine (15 + days per month, 8 of those with migraine symptoms). The impact on lifestyle modifications necessary such as social interactions or regular sleep schedules most likely vary a lot. In our analysis, we did not differentiate based on frequency in measuring the acceptance of self-care techniques. We can assume that those with a higher frequency already have a larger toolkit of migraine management strategies (acute, preventative, or self-care) which potentially could impact the willingness to add new strategies to their management. On the other hand, those with a low frequency might not be willing to engage in new strategies as the impact of the disease might be lower.\nThe topic of using a mood journal was only explored in relation to migraine. Asking for general use of (mood) journals could have given additional insights into patients' behaviour. Due to the low number of respondents who are using emotional diaries, it is difficult to conclude any feedback on their importance or benefit.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusions\nMigraine management is dominated by pharmaceutical management for acute pain attacks and lifestyle changes for managing migraine long-term. Perception of the effectiveness of those techniques is high, whereas perception of interventions that target the emotional or psychological components of chronic pain management (keeping a mood diary, and mental health support) is mixed. There exists a gap between the recommended biopsychosocial approach and the current state of migraine management.\nConclusions\nMigraine management is dominated by an over-reliance on pharmaceutical interventions to manage acute pain attacks, whereas lifestyle changes are usually considered as a second option for managing migraine in the long term. Perceptions on the effectiveness of those techniques are high whereas perception of interventions that target the emotional or psychological component of chronic pain management (e.g., keeping a mood diary, and mental health support) are mixed. There exists a gap between what the latest research on chronic pain and migraine management suggests, a bio-psychosocial approach, and the current state of migraine management. Future research is necessary to identify causes and solutions for this gap.\nAbbreviations: CBT: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; IQR: Interquartile range; OTC: Over the counter\nAcknowledgements: The authors thank the National Migraine Centre (London, United Kingdom), the Migraine Association of Ireland (Dublin, Ireland), and UK Pain Relief Foundation (Liverpool, United Kingdom) for disseminating the survey and study information to personal contacts.\nCorrespondence:\nAuthor details: 1 grid.413820.c, 0000 0001 2191 5195, Department of Primary Care & Public Health, Self-Care Academic Research Unit (SCARU) Imperial College London, Charing Cross Hospital, , W6 8RF, London, UK.",
