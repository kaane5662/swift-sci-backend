The analysis of the Boston crime dataset revealed that all predictors, including Nox, rad, tax, and lstat, were statistically significant (p < .05 for each). Among these predictors, rad showed a moderately strong association with crim (r > .5). Additionally, rad was identified as the most accurate predictor for modeling crim, as it had the smallest mean squared error (MSE = 30.04 percentage points). These findings suggest that rad plays a crucial role in predicting criminal activity in Boston.
