Ion channel drugs have been increasing used for chronic pain management with progress in the development of selective calcium channel modulators. Although ion channel drugs have been proven safe and effective in clinical practice, uncertainty remains regarding its use to treat chronic pain. To standardize the clinical practice of ion channel drug for the treatment of chronic pain, the National Health Commission Capacity Building and Continuing Education Center for Pain Diagnosis and Treatment Special Ability Training Project established an expert group to form an expert consensus on the use of ion channel drugs for the treatment of chronic pain after repeated discussions on existing medical evidence combined with the well clinical experience of experts. The consensus provided information on the mechanism of action of ion channel drugs and their recommendations, caution use, contraindications, and precautions for their use in special populations to support doctors in their clinical decision-making.

Introduction
Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists for >3 months. The International Society for Pain (IASP) classifies chronic pain into two categories: chronic primary and secondary pain syndromes. (1) Currently, there is relatively few epidemiological data regarding the prevalence of chronic pain according to the IASP classification in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). In 2019, Wang et al (2) conducted a preliminary survey of 1545 patients with chronic pain according to the IASP ICD-11 chronic pain classification in five tertiary general hospitals in three provinces and four regions in China and found that the proportion of chronic secondary pain syndrome was as high as 98.64% (1524 cases), while primary pain only accounted for 1.36% (21 cases). Among them, the population with chronic secondary pain syndrome included 32.87% (501) patients with chronic neuropathic pain, 29.20% (445) with chronic secondary headache or maxillofacial pain, 22.57% (344) with chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain, 11.55% (176) with chronic secondary visceral pain, 2.10% (32) with chronic cancer-related pain, and 1.71% (26) with chronic postoperative or posttraumatic pain.
Drugs are the primary treatment modality for chronic pain. (3) At present, besides traditional non-steroidal analgesics and opioids, ion channel drugs have been increasing used for chronic pain management with progress in the development of selective calcium channel modulators, state-dependent sodium channel antagonists, and similar drugs. (4-6) Recent studies have revealed that abnormal expression of voltage-dependent ion channels plays a key role in peripheral sensitivity, central sensitivity, and neuroplastic changes in chronic pain. (7,8) Ion channel drugs could inhibit the peripheral sensitization and central sensitization to alleviate chronic pain. Although ion channel drugs have been proven safe and effective in clinical practice, uncertainty remains regarding its use to treat chronic pain. To date, there have been no reference standards to guide clinical practice and no relevant expert consensus on this product, in China. In this context, we invited experts in basic and clinical medicine of pain management to develop a Chinese expert consensus and provide a reference for the standard application of ion channel drugs in chronic pain.
A panel of 15 Chinese pain medicine experts was organized by the National Health Commission Capacity Building and Continuing Education Center for Pain Diagnosis and Treatment Special Ability Training Project and a consensus meeting was held online on 20/08/2022. PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CNKI, and Wanfang electronic databases were searched to identify related publications, including systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, observational cohort studies, and case studies published in English and Chinese. Based on this evidence and clinical experience, the experts reached a consensus on the recommendations. For the quality and strength of evidence, the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) system was used. For recommendation grading, the quality of evidence, clinical benefits and harm, cost, patient preference, and value were considered.
Mechanism of Ion Channel Drugs
Multiple complex pathophysiological mechanisms are responsible for the development and progression of chronic pain. Chronic pain can cause changes in the synaptic plasticity in the cerebral cortex, leading to augmented pain transmission. Peripheral and central sensitizations are major causes of hypersensitivity in patients and may initially be triggered by peripheral nerve injury and inflammation. (9) A reduction in the activation threshold of sensing channels induced by nerve injury, including changes in sodium and calcium ion channels, is an important mechanism that leads to peripheral sensitization. (10) The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) expresses a variety of ion channel proteins, such as sodium and calcium. After neuronal injury, a series of functional and density changes in voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels occur on the membrane of DRG neurons, resulting in a large number of abnormal action potentials in this area, which is one of the mechanisms that cause chronic pain. (11)
Altered N-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) function in sensory neurons has been implicated in one of these mechanisms. N-type VGCCs contribute significantly to the synaptic transmission of pain signals in DRG neurons and play major roles in pain information processing by controlling neurotransmitter release from nociceptive nerve fibers and modulating synaptic plasticity at the first synapse of the nociceptive pathways. (12) VGCC opens when the body is subjected to noxious stimulation or nerve injury, and a large Ca (2)+ influx activates protein kinase C (PKC, an intracellular second messenger that plays an important role in the transmission of noxious stimuli), promoting the occurrence and development of pain. Calcium channel modulators inhibit the influx of calcium ions and reduce the release of neurotransmitters, thereby reducing the abnormal excitation of pain transduction pathways to achieve pain relief. (13) Gabapentin and pregabalin are the most frequently prescribed calcium channel modulators for neuropathic pain. Gabapentin interacts with subunits [alpha]2[delta] of the VGCC, which are mainly located in the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and spinal cord. Gabapentin was first used for the treatment of epilepsy and is now used for treating neuropathic pain. Pregabalin is a new-generation drug based on gabapentin that has been approved for the treatment of diabetic peripheral and postherpetic neuralgia.
The voltage-gated Na + channel (VGSC) is a microporous transmembrane protein that is widely distributed on the membranes of excitable cells, such as neurons, and is mainly responsible for the transmembrane transport of Na +. VGSCs play a key role in the initiation and propagation of electrical signaling in excitable cells. (14,15) VGSCs consist of pore-forming and auxiliary subunits. Nociceptors express multiple subtypes of a-subunits. Tissue and nerve damage leads to changes in the expression and function of [alpha]-subunits that in turn can lead to changes in the excitability of sensory neurons. Changes in the excitability of sensory neurons are thought to underlie chronic pain conditions. (16) To date, at least nine distinct sodium channel isoforms have been detected in the nervous system, and the sodium channel subtypes Nav1.3, Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 are associated with various pain states. (17) They are useful analgesic drug targets for various types of pain, including neuropathic pain. Sodium channel blockers include carbamazepine, lidocaine, and bulleyaconitine A (BLA). They block different types of voltage-dependent sodium channels and inhibit overexcited sensory neurons.
Ion Channel Drugs in the Treatment of Chronic Pain Diseases
Chronic Neuropathic Pain
Postherpetic Neuralgia
Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common type of neuropathic pain, defined as pain lasting [greater than or equal to]1 month after Herpes Zoster (HZ) onset or healing, and is the most common complication of HZ. Meta-analysis data show that the annual incidence of PHN in the population ranges from 3.9 to 42.0/100,000, with PHN occurring in 9-34% of patients with HZ. At present, it is believed that peripheral sensitization and central sensitization are important mechanisms of PHN, and the up-regulation of voltage-gated calcium channel [alpha]2-5 subunit and sodium channel is the main reason for central sensitization. (18,19) Therefore, ion-channel drugs can be used as treatment options for patients with PHN. Compared with oral administration, topical administration can directly act on the target with better tolerance and compliance and fewer adverse gastrointestinal tract reactions. (20) The therapeutic status of ion channel drugs (gabapentin, pregabalin, and lidocaine plaster) in PHN has been clarified by the expert consensus. (21-23)
Recommendations: Calcium channel modulators (pregabalin and gabapentin) are first-line drugs for the treatment of PHN. In addition, 5% lidocaine patches can also be used as a first-line treatment, especially for patients who have difficulties in oral medications, such as those with dysphagia, since lidocaine has less systemic absorption, does not require dose adjustment, and is more convenient to use. Alternatively, carbamazepine is also effective in the treatment of PHN; however, the evidence for its use is limited, and its combination with other drugs is recommended. Although BLA has been recommended for the treatment of PHN, no large randomized controlled clinical studies have been conducted.
A systematic review (24) evaluated the analgesic effects of pregabalin in patients with PHN. A total of 2192 patients from seven clinical studies were included (pregabalin group = 1381, control group, 811). Pregabalin was associated with a higher percentage of 30% and 50% of pain responders, respectively, than the controls (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the pregabalin group had lower sleep interference scores and better PGIC scores compared to the control group (P<0.05). Another systematic review (25) evaluated the analgesic effects of gabapentin on patients with PHN. Seven trials involving 2039 participants were identified. A pooled analysis showed that gabapentin significantly reduced PHN-related pain compared with the placebo (P<0.001). Gabapentin is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for PHN. Lidocaine-medicated plaster in single or combined regimens can help relieve PHN pain and improve quality of life and sleep. A two-stage adaptive, randomized, open-label, multicenter, non-inferiority study (26) compared the efficacy and safety of 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster with pregabalin in 96 patients with PHN and reported that 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster is comparable to pregabalin in terms of pain relief in PHN but is better tolerated and has fewer adverse effects than pregabalin (Table 1). In patients with refractory PHN, nerve block therapy combined with lidocaine external plasters can be considered to improve the therapeutic effect. (27) Studies have shown that carbamazepine combined with other drugs has good efficacy in the treatment of PHN (Table 1). A randomized controlled clinical study (28) evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of pregabalin combined with carbamazepine in 114 patients with PHN. The results showed that the visual analogue scale (VAS) score significantly decreased in the three groups after treatment (P<0.05) (carbamazepine, pregabalin, and combination groups), and the VAS score in the combination group was significantly lower than that in the other groups (P<0.05) (Table 1). According to a Chinese expert consensus (18) on PHN, BLA has also been used to treat PHN. However, there are only a few reports on the use of BLA in the treatment of PHN. Nevertheless, evidence from large-scale clinical trials is limited. In patients with HZ pain, combination treatment with BLA is recommended to prevent PHN.
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain
Diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) is peripheral neuropathic pain caused by diabetes or prediabetes. The general manifestation is symmetrical peripheral neuropathic pain mainly involving the distal extremities, which may also manifest as non-neuralgic pain or neuralgia in the brachial or lumbosacral plexus. (36) The prevalence of DPNP is 10-26% (37-39) More than 70% of patients with DPNP have moderate to severe persistent pain, insomnia, poor quality of life, and mood disturbances, resulting in a 5-fold increase in medical costs compared to patients with diabetes. (40-42) Peripheral sensitization, central sensitization, and ion channel changes are the main pathogenesis of DPNP, and the high expression of [alpha]2-[delta] subunits on calcium ion channels is the main reason for central sensitization. (43) The therapeutic status of ion channel drugs (gabapentin, pregabalin, lidocaine plaster) in DPNP has been clarified in the multiple expert consensus. (21,36,44)
Recommendations: Calcium channel modulators (gabapentin and pregabalin) are recommended for the treatment of DPNP. For patients who have difficulty taking oral medications, the use of a lidocaine patch is recommended for the treatment of DPNP. Carbamazepine is recommended for DPNP treatment. The sodium channel antagonist, BLA, can also be used to treat DPNP; however, no large randomized controlled clinical studies have been conducted.
A double-blind randomized clinical trial conducted by Joharchi K (29) included 180 patients with DPNP to evaluate the efficacy and safety of duloxetine and pregabalin. The results showed that the intensity of pain was significantly improved by both drugs significantly (p<0.001), with no significant difference between the two groups (Table 1). However, in the duloxetine and pregabalin groups, 74% and 37% of patients, respectively, reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The discontinuation rates owing to ADRs were 19% and 7%, respectively. Accordingly, despite having the same efficacy, pregabalin was better tolerated than duloxetine. Another prospective randomized open-label study conducted by Devi P (30) included 152 patients with DPNP and compared the efficacy and safety of gabapentin, duloxetine, and pregabalin in patients with DPNP. The results showed a significant reduction in the VAS score, sleep interference score, Patient Global Impression of Change, and Clinical Global Impression of Change in all three treatment groups over time (P<0.05), with no statistically significant difference between the groups. Improvements in VAS scores and sleep interference scores were higher with pregabalin than with duloxetine and gabapentin (Table 1). A network meta-analysis comparing 5% lidocaine plaster with other related agents for DPNP pain relief showed that 5% lidocaine plaster provided comparable pain relief to amitriptyline, capsaicin, gabapentin, and pregabalin and that topical agents had fewer adverse effects than systemic agents. (45) A randomized controlled clinical study conducted by Deng (31) included 74 patients with DPNP and evaluated the clinical efficacy of carbamazepine in the treatment of DPNP. The results showed that the VAS scores significantly decreased after carbamazepine treatment (Table 1). Previous studies using BLA acupuncture point injection in the treatment of DPNP, showed that the physical pain of the total effective rate was 84%. (46)
Chronic Postsurgical or Posttraumatic Pain
The incidence of postoperative chronic pain ranges from 5-85% and varies greatly depending on the type of surgery. The incidence of phantom limb pain after amputation is 30-85%, after lumbar surgery is 10-40%, and after multiple traumas is 46-85%. (47) Central or peripheral pain sensitization is the main pathogenesis of postoperative chronic pain, and the high expression of a2-5 subunits on calcium ion channels is the main reason for central sensitization. (43) The therapeutic status of calcium ion channel drugs (gabapentin and pregabalin) in chronic postoperative or posttraumatic pain has been clarified in the multiple clinical practice guidelines and expert consensus. (48-50)
Recommendations: Gabapentin and pregabalin are recommended in combination with conventional analgesics for patients with chronic pain after surgery or trauma.
Eight studies were included in a meta-analysis, in which six gabapentin trials demonstrated a moderate-to-large reduction in the development of chronic postsurgical pain (pooled OR 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.98; P = 0.04), and two pregabalin trials found a significantly large reduction in the development of chronic postsurgical pain (pooled OR 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.79; P = 0.007). (51) After including 55 studies, a meta-regression was performed to assess the impact of individual doses and frequency of pregabalin administration on analgesic efficacy. When all doses and administration regimens were combined, pregabalin was associated with a significant reduction in pain scores at rest and during movement and opioid consumption at 24h compared with placebo {mean difference [95% confidence interval (CI)]=-0.38 (-0.57, -0.20), -0.47 (-0.76, -0.18), and -8.27 mg morphine equivalents (-10.08, -6.47), respectively}. (52)
Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain (CMP)
CMP refers to pain that occurs in the muscles, bones, joints, tendons, or soft tissues for > 3 months. The incidence of CMP increases annually, leading to pain and disability in older adults. (53) Lower back pain is the most common type of CMP, with an incidence of 30-40% in adults. (54) Central and peripheral sensitization are the main pathogens of CMP along with the abnormal opening of gated sodium and calcium channels and decreased regulatory ability of the spinal cord and central nervous system. The therapeutic status of calcium ion channel drugs (gabapentin, pregabalin) and sodium ion channel drugs (lidocaine) in chronic postoperative or posttraumatic pain has been clarified in the multiple expert consensus. (53,55)
Recommendations: Pharmacological treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be considered as the first-line therapy for patients with CMP. Ion-channel drugs can be added to or replaced to NSAIDs in patients who do not respond well or have contraindications (gastrointestinal and cardiovascular diseases). Moreover, they may be preferred in patients with marked central or peripheral sensitization. Gabapentin and pregabalin are recommended for chronic neuropathic limb pain; whereas, gabapentin is recommended for chronic lower back pain. Lidocaine plaster is recommended for treating chronic low back pain and neuropathic limb pain. BLA is recommended for the treatment of pain in the joints and soft tissues of the extremities, neck, shoulder, waist, and leg caused by intervertebral disc disease and for pain in patients with rheumatic immune diseases.
A systematic review of 15 trials (1468 participants) on pharmacotherapy for chronic pain found that gabapentin was more efficacious than the placebo (42% vs 19%) in decreasing chronic pain by 50% in patients with neuropathic pain, phantom limb pain, spinal cord injury, and other neuropathies. Lidocaine plasters block gated sodium channel transmission in nociceptors at the peripheral level. Plasters may have modest efficacy in the management of chronic pain secondary to LBP and various neuropathies. (56) An open, single-arm clinical study conducted by Liu (57) et al included 200 patients with chronic pain and evaluated the treatment of joint pain; soft tissue pain; and chronic pain of the neck, shoulder, waist, and leg caused by intervertebral disc lesions using BLA. The results showed that the total effective rate for joint and soft tissue pain was 80%. The total efficacy rate was 81%, and the VAS score was significantly lower after 1-4 weeks of treatment. BLA have dual pharmacological effects on central and peripheral analgesia, as well as immunoregulatory effects. Several clinical studies have shown that BLA have good clinical efficacy in treating osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and knee osteoarthritis and can significantly reduce the VAS score. (58-61)
Chronic Cancer-Related Pain
Cancer-related pain refers to pain caused by direct aggression or indirect action of the cancer itself and various anti-tumor treatments, as well as pain due to other complications and non-tumor factors such as psychosocial factors. (62) The treatment of cancer pain is often based on the principle of indirect action. (63) Ion channel drugs can increase the analgesic effect of opioids, reduce the dose of opioids, and can be used for cancer-related neuropathological pain treatment and complementary treatment. (64,65)
Recommendations: Gabapentin, pregabalin, lidocaine, and BLA can be used for the treatment and adjuvant therapy of cancer-related neuropathic pain and can increase the analgesic effect of opioids and reduce the dose of opioids.
This randomized double-blind study included 128 patients to test the efficacy and safety of pregabalin versus placebo for the treatment of radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain. 38 Patients (59.4%) in the pregabalin arm achieved at least 30% pain relief versus 21 patients (32.8%) in the placebo arm (P=0.006) (32) (Table 1). A systematic review of 10 studies identified articles on the use of prophylactic gabapentin in patients undergoing head and neck cancer therapy. Prophylactic gabapentin appears to be a promising treatment option for preventing pain, reducing opioid use, and reducing weight loss in patients undergoing head and neck cancer therapy. (66) In a prospective, open-label, single-arm study, 5% lidocaine transdermal patches reduced the numerical rating scale (NRS) pain intensity in patients with neuropathic cancer already receiving opioid treatment (33) (Table 1). Li (34) et al used BLA capsules combined with morphine sulfate sustained-release tablets to treat advanced cancer. The results showed that when satisfactory analgesia was achieved (VAS<3), the dose of morphine sulfate sustained-release tablets was significantly reduced in combination with BLA compared to morphine sulfate sustained-release tablets alone (P<0.05) (Table 1).
Chronic Visceral Pain (CVP)
CVP is one of the most common forms of pain reported clinically in chronic pain with an incidence of up to 20%. Visceral pain refers to pain in the body's internal organs and is often associated with various diseases such as acute and chronic pancreatitis and functional gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Adjunctive drugs should be introduced during the early stages of pain management in the presence of central sensitization (hyperalgesia and allodynia). Currently, the main clinical applications are ion channel drugs. (67,68)
Recommendations: Gabapentin, pregabalin, and BLA are recommended as adjuvant analgesics in CVP treatment.
Both gabapentin and pregabalin have been demonstrated to reduce pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis and IBS. (69-71) In a randomized controlled trial, adjuvant pregabalin resulted in more effective pain relief at 3 weeks and was associated with improved health status in patients with chronic pancreatitis compared to placebo (35) (Table 1). BLA has been demonstrated to reduce pain in patients with CVP and IBS. (72,73)
Caution Use and Contraindications of Ion Channel Drugs
Use with Caution
Coronary artery disease or other cardiac impairments (except heart block), hypovolemia, or shock. Patients with liver and kidney dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, blood system adverse reaction history, diabetes, endocrine disorders, psychiatric history, newborns, premature infants, the elderly, and infirmities.
Contraindications
Patients who are allergic to ion channel drugs along with acute cardiogenic cerebral ischemic syndrome (A-S syndrome), pre-excitation syndrome, heart block (including sinoatrial, atrioventricular, and intraventricular conduction blocks), lactating women, patients with a history of myelopathic depression, patients with severe abnormal serum iron, patients with a history of hepatic porphyria, patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, and patients with acute pancreatitis should not be prescribed ion channel drugs.
Adverse Reactions and Treatment Principles of Ion Channel Drugs
Carbamazepine
Common side effects include blurred vision, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting, which mostly occur 1-2 weeks after the treatment. Rashes, urticaria, liver dysfunction, and hypothyroidism are rare. Granulocytopenia, bone marrow suppression, arrhythmia, and liver and kidney failures are rare complications. Carbamazepine has a narrow therapeutic window and is associated with multiple adverse systemic reactions. Carbamazepine causes Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis, and other serious diseases that are highly correlated with the variant alleles HLA-B *15:02 and LA-A*31:01 carried by patients. (74) Special attention should also be paid to hyperalgesia caused by carbamazepine withdrawal. (4)
Oxcarbazepine
The most common adverse effects were rash, dizziness, headache, and drowsiness. The total incidence of adverse effects was 45.22%, most of which were mild and alleviated or disappeared after 3-4 weeks. Oxcarbazepine can also cause a severe rash, such as life-threatening SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis, with a lower incidence than carbamazepine (1 to 6/10,000 for carbamazepine vs 0.5 to 6/1,000,000 for oxcarbazepine). (75) During treatment, it is necessary to monitor for signs of depression, suicidal thoughts, or abnormal behavioral and mood changes. (76)
Lidocaine Plaster
The side effects of 5% lidocaine plaster include moderate skin reactions, such as erythema and rash. The use of lidocaine plasters should be avoided in patients taking oral class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as mexiletine, and in patients with severe liver impairment. Intravenous lidocaine should be administered in an environment that includes monitoring and rescue conditions. Additionally, the concentration, total amount, and infusion speed of the drug should be strictly controlled. Patients who are allergic to amide local anesthetics or other ingredients in the product are contraindicated.
BIA
No drug tolerance, addiction, or adverse gastrointestinal effects were observed. Very few patients experienced transient mild palpitations, nausea, lip numbness, or palpitations. The response is transient and can be relieved after treatment. (77) The interval between the two administrations of BLA should not be < 6h. BLA should also be used with caution in patients with heart diseases, such as arrhythmia.
Gabapentin
Common adverse effects include dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia, and peripheral edema. The symptoms of withdrawal include disturbances of consciousness, disorientation, non-specific gastrointestinal reactions, hyperhidrosis, and tremors. Gabapentin dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's renal function. During the medication period, the withdrawal of gabapentin or the addition of a new treatment plan should be gradually carried out, and the time should be at least 1 week. The plasma concentration of gabapentin may increase in patients treated with morphine at the same time. (78) Even if gabapentin was administered per the prescribed dosage, the reaction rate was reduced. Therefore, individuals engaged in driving and manipulating complex machinery should use them cautiously.
Pregabalin
The adverse effects include dizziness, somnolence, ataxia, headaches, language barriers, and tremors. Pregabalin can cause peripheral edema and a prolonged PR interval and should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure and heart function grade III or IV. Adverse endocrine effects include an increase in body weight, with an occurrence rate of 4% to 12%. Muscular skeletal adverse effects include elevated creatine kinase levels, myoclonus, and stripe muscle dissolution. Pregabalin treatment occasionally causes mild transient increases in liver enzymes, saliva deficiency, constipation, thrombocytopenia, blurred vision, diplopia, and amblyopia. (79) The pregabalin dosage needs to be adjusted according to the patient's renal function. During treatment, it is necessary to monitor for signs of depression, suicidal thoughts, or abnormal behavioral and mood changes. (76)
Gabapentin and pregabalin are addictive, and sudden withdrawal increases the frequency of seizures and produces withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, headache, and diarrhea. Therefore, when discontinuing the drug, the dosage should be gradually reduced for at least 1 week.
The Precautions of Ion Channel Drugs in Special Populations
Precautions for Children
Most ion-channel drugs can be used in children; however, pregabalin is not suitable for patients <17 years of age. BLA has not yet been tested as a medication in children, so it should be used with caution in children. Although hypothyroidism is a rare adverse reaction to oxcarbazepine, children <2 years of age should undergo a Meth test before initiation of oxcarbazepine treatment. (80)
Precautions for Pregnancy and Lactation
This drug is not suitable for pregnant women because it can be secreted through breast milk, and therefore, it is contraindicated in lactating women. Additionally, simultaneous use of oxcarbazepine and oral hormonal contraceptives is associated with contraceptive failure. (81)
Precautions for Elderly People
Elderly individuals can selectively use ion-channel drugs according to their liver and kidney function. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to carbamazepine because it frequently causes cognitive impairment, anxiety, confusion, atrioventricular block, and aplastic anemia. Accordingly, these drugs need to be carefully selected. (80,81) BLA has not been tested as a medication for the elderly; therefore, it should be used with caution.
Conclusion
Based on the existing medical evidence and experts' clinical experience, this consensus put forward suggestions regarding the use of ion channel drugs for the treatment of chronic pain, such as pregabalin, gabapentin, lidocaine patch, carbamazepine and BLA. At present, there is relatively abundant evidence for gabapentin, pregabalin, and lidocaine patch in the treatment of chronic pain. However, the evidence for carbamazepine and BLA is relatively limited. It is hoped that this consensus will support doctors in their clinical decision-making.

 ---------------------------------------------- 
Objectives: To study the risk factors associated with lower back pain such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, education level, smoking and alcohol consumption among patients who presented to the Algology Polyclinic.
Methods: The patients' age, gender, occupation, marital status, education, economic level, smoking and alcohol consumption were evaluated and recorded on a "Pain Assessment Form". The highest level of education level was asked and when economic level was questioned, the answers of patients were considered without restricrion between limits.
Results: Out of 772 patients, 200 had mechanical lower back pain. 23.5% had hernia nucleous pulposus, 20% had facet joint degeneration, 18.5% had a narrow spinal channel, 7.5% had sakroiliac joint degeneration, 20.1% had more than one pathology, and 10.5% had other pathologies. Lower back pain did not differ according to age and gender. Students had significantly lower pain, whereas workers had significantly higher lower back pain (p = 0.005). Of the patients with lower back pain, 170 of them were married and 30 were widowed or single (p = 0.059). With higher education, pain was significantly decreased (p=0.001). More pain was reported among individuals with low socioeconomic level (p = 0.042). There was a correlation between lower back pain and smoking (p = 0030), but there was no correlation between lower back pain and alcohol consumption (p = 0.638).
Conclusion: Lower education, lower economic level, labor intensive jobs and smoking were correlated with lower back pain. It was concluded that by taking precautions that lower risk factors, incidence of lower back pain can be decreased.
Key words: Algology polyclinic; low back pain; risk factors.
Amac: Algoloji poliklinigine bel agrisi sikayetiyle basvuran hastalarin yas, cinsiyet, medeni durum, meslek, egitim duzeyleri, sigara ve alkol kullanimi gibi ozellikleri incelendi ve bel agrisini tetikleyen risk faktorleri arastirildi. Gerec ve Yontemi Hastalarin yas, cinsiyet, meslek, medeni hal, ogrenim ve ekonomik durumu, sigara ve alkol kullanimi bilgileri soruldu ve "Agri Degerlendirme Formu"na kaydedildi. Hastalarin ogrenim durumlari sorgulanirken, en son okuduklari ogrenim duzeyleri, ekonomik durum herhangi bir gelir duzeyi ile sinirlanmaksizin, hastalarin kendi ifade ettikleri yanitlar goz onune alindi.
Bulgular: Poliklinigimize basvuran 772 hastanin 200'unde mekanik bel agrisi saptandi. Hastalarin %23.5'inde disk hernisi, %20 'inde faset eklem dejenerasyonu, %18.5'inde dar spinal kanal, %7.5'inde sakroiliyak eklem dejenerasyonu, %20.1'inde birden fazla patoloji, %10.5'inde diger patolojiler tespit edildi. Bel agrisi yasa ve cinsiyete gore farklilik gostermedi. Iscilerde bel agrisi belirgin olarak yuksek, ogrencilerde dusuk saptandi (p=0.005). Bel agrili hastalarin 170'i evli, 30'u dul veya bekardi (p=0.059). Yuksek egitim ile agrinin azaldigi tespit edildi (p=0.001). Dusuk ekonomik durumdakilerde daha fazla agri saptandi (p=0.042). Sigara icme bel agrisi ile iliskili bulunurken (p=0.030), alkol alimi ile bel agrisi arasindaki iliski saptanmadi (p=0.638). Sonuc: Dusuk egitim, dusuk ekonomik duzey, agir islerde calisma ve sigara kullanimi ile bel agrisi arasinda anlamli iliski bulundu. Risk faktorlerini azaltmaya yonelik onlemlerin alinmasi ile maddi kayba neden olan, gunluk yasam aktivitelerini engelleyen bel agrisi sikliginin bir olcude azaltilabilecegi kanisina varildi.
Anahtar sozcukler: Agri poliklinigi; bel agrisi; risk faktorleri. Summary
Giris
Bel agrisi tum dunya nufusunun %85'inin, hayatlarinda en az bir defa gecirdikleri ve tipta cok sik rastladigimiz bir sendromdur. [1] Sanayilesmis ulkelerde bel agrisi epidemi halindedir. Akut bel agrisi olgularinin %80'inde 6-8 hafta icinde tedaviye bagli olmaksizin iyilesme olmasina karsin, bunlarin %38'inde bir yil icinde yeni atak gelismektedir. [2] Akut bel agrisinda ilk atagi onlemek onemlidir. Bel agrisinda kroniklesme ve izleyen sakatliga engel olmak icin agriyi baslatan ve kroniklestiren faktorleri tanimak ve onlem almak onemlidir.
Faset eklem osteoartritinde bel agrisi yaninda, tek veya cift tarafli bacak agrisi gorulmektedir. Uzun sureli oturmak, ayakta durmak, bel ekstansiyonu agriyi arttirirken, istirahatla agri azalir. Muayenede faset eklemler basmakla agrilidir. Tani amacli yapilan fa-set eklem mediyan sinir bloklari ile agrinin azalmasi daha degerlidir. [3,4]
Disk hernisi, nukleus pulposus'un anulus fibrosus liflerinden fitiklasmasidir. Tani goruntuleme yontemlerinden cok, anamnez ve fizik baki ile konur. [5,6] Lomber spinal stenoz, spinal kanalin ve interver-tebral foramenin dogustan veya edinsel olarak daral-masidir. Dejeneratif eklem hastaligi en sik nedenidir. Aktiviteyle agri olusur, hastalar norojenik kladikasyo ile basvururlar. [7] Sakroiliyak eklem (SIE) disfonksi-yonu sonucu sakrum hareketleri azalir, lumbosakral diske binen yuk artar ve buna bagli bel agrisi olusur. Agri SIE cevresinde en fazla olmakla birlikte, kalcanin arka dis kismina, uyluk ve bacagin arka kismina yayilabilir. [8,9] Spondilolizis vertebranin noral arkusu-nun stres kirigidir. Spondiloliztezis ise, bir vertebra-nin altindaki vertebraya gore yer degistirmesidir. [10]
Amacimiz algoloji poliklinigine bel agrisi sikayetiyle basvuran hastalarin yas, cinsiyet, medeni durum, meslek ve egitim duzeyleri gibi sosyodemografik ozelliklerini inceleyerek bel agrisini tetikleyen risk faktorlerini arastirmaktir.
Gerec ve Yontem
Adnan Menderes Universitesi Tip Fakultesi Algoloji (Agri) Poliklinigi'ne basvuran hastalarin klinik tablolarini degerlendirebilmek amaciyla hastalarla yuz yuze yapilan ayrintili anamnezde; hastalarin yas, cinsiyet, meslek, medeni hal, ogrenim ve ekonomik durumu, sigara ve alkol kullanimi bilgileri, onceden hazirlanmis olan "Agri Degerlendirme Formuna gore soruldu ve alinan bilgiler mevcut form uzerine kaydedildi.
Agri degerlendirme formundaki bilgiler bilgisayara aktarilirken, hastalarin verdigi acik uclu cevaplardan, verilen en sik yanitlar goz onune alinarak grup-landirildi. Hastalarin ogrenim durumlari sorgulanirken, en son okuduklari (mezun olduklari veya terk ettikleri) ogrenim duzeyleri kaydedildi. Ekonomik durum icin, herhangi bir gelir duzeyi ile sinir-lanmaksizin, hastalarin kendi ifade ettikleri yanitlar goz onune alindi.
Agrinin yerlesimi siniflandirilirken, International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Agri Tak-sonomisi Alt Komitesi'nin yaptigi bes eksenli agri siniflamasi kullanildi. Agrinin ilk baslangic suresi, agrinin baslangicindan itibaren uc ay ve altindaki agrilar "akut agri", uc ayin uzerindeki agrilar "kronik agri" olarak degerlendirildi. Detayli anamnez ve fizik muayene ve radyolojik goruntuleme yontemleri sonucu tani konuldu. Bir kisim hasta ise konsultasyon istemi olarak tani konulmus sekilde poliklinigimize basvurdu.
Istatistiksel analiz "SPSS 14,0 for Windows" programi kullanilarak yapildi, tanimlayici istatistiklerde yuzde, ortalama [+ or -] standart sapma degerleri hesap-lanmmis gruplararasi karsilastirmalarda ki-kare ve Student-t testi kullanildi.
Bulgular
Hastanin sikayeti, yasi, cinsiyeti, meslegi, medeni durumu, ogrenim duzeyi, ekonomik duzeyi, sigara ve alkol kullanimi sirasiyla incelendi.
Hastalarin yaslari 13-97 arasindaydi (ort. 55.11 [+ or -] 14.98). Kadinlar 16-86 (ort. 54.39 [+ or -] 14.07), erkekler 13-97 (ort 56.31 [+ or -] 16.35) yas araligindaydi. Poliklinigimize basvuran ve dosya ve bilgilerine tam olarak ulasilabilen 772 hastanin agri sikayetinin dagilimi Tablo 1'de gosterilmektedir.
Yapilan detayli anamnez, fizik muayene ve radyolojik tetkikler neticesinde 200 hastada bel agrisina neden olan patolojiler saptandi. Bel agrisi tanisi konmus 200 hastanin dagilimi Tablo 2'de gosterilmektedir. Diger bel agrisi nedenleri spondilolizis, spon-dilolistezis, vertebra kirigi, basarisiz bel cerrahisi, miyofasyal agri ve lomber vertebra metastasidir. Kirk (%20) hastada ise mekanik bel agrisina neden olabilecek birden fazla patoloji birlikteydi.
Bel agrisini etkileyen risk faktorlerini inceledigimizde, 64 yas ve alti 145 hastada (%25.9) bel agrisi sikayeti varken, 65 yas ve ustu 55 hastada (%25.9) bel agrisi mevcuttu. Yas ilerlemesi ile bel agrisi arasinda anlamli bir iliski saptanmadi (p=0.948, X2=0.001). Yetmisbir erkek hastada (%24.7), 129 kadin hastada (%26.7) bel agrisinin oldugu, cinsiyet farkinin istatistik olarak anlamli olmadigi goruldu (p=0.540, [chi square]=0.376).

Bel agrisi tanisi konan 200 hastanin 170'i (%27.4) evli iken, 30 hasta (%19.9) dul veya bekardi. Medeni durum ile bel agrisi arasinda bir iliski saptanmadi (p=0.059, [chi square]=3.567).
Hastalarin egitim durumlari ile agri arasindaki iliskiyi inceledigimizde, egitim ile agrinin azaldigi tespit edildi (p=0.001, [chi square]=11.879) (Tablo 4).
Ekonomik durumla bel agrisi arasindaki iliskinin istatistik olarak anlamli oldugu, bu farkin dusuk ekonomik durumu olan gruptan kaynaklandigi saptandi (p=0.042, [chi square]=6.341) (Tablo 5).
Sigara risk faktoru ile bel agrisi arasindaki iliski Tablo 6'da gosterilmektedir. Sigara risk faktoru bel agrisi ile iliskili bulundu (p=0.030, [chi square]=4.694). Alkol alimi ile bel agrisi arasindaki iliski, anlamsiz olarak tespit edildi (p=0.638, [chi square]=0.222).
Tartisma
Kronik agri sendromlari yuzunden, pek cok insan aci cekmekte ama pek azi dogru ve yeterli tedavi gormektedir. Ueno ve ark. yasam boyu bel agrisi prevalansini %53.2 olarak bildirmistir. [11] Ferguson ve Marras ise %72 gibi buyuk bir oran saptamistir. [12] Yapilan pekcok agri epidemiyoloji calismasinda, en sik gorulen sikayetin bel agrisi oldugu saptanmis-tir. [13-17] Bizim calismamizda da poliklinige basvuran hastalarin en sik sikayetlerinin bel ve sirt agrisi oldugu (%32.0) goruldu.
Kronik bel agrilari, endustrilesmis toplumlarda onemli is gucu ve ekonomik kayiplara neden olmaktadir. Literaturde bildirilen calismalarda cinsiyet, yas, psikolojik stres, yetersiz fiziksel aktivite, sigara kullanimi, issizlik, isten memnun olmama gibi faktorlerin bel agrisi riskini 2-3 kat arttirdigi belirtil-mistir. [18-20]
Bejia ve ark. hastane calisanlarinda yaptiklari calismada, hayat boyu bel agrisi prevalansini %57.7, kronik bel agrisi prevalansini ise %12.8 olarak bulmuslardir. Bel agrisi ile iliskili risk faktorlerini irdeledikleri calismalarinda ileri yasin ve kadin cinsiyetin bel agrisi icin onemli oldugunu vurgulamislardir. [21] Levangie calismasinda, kadinlarin %60'inda, erkeklerin ise %40'inda bel agrisi oldugunu ortaya koy-mustur. [22]
Arslantas ve ark., [23] Eskisehir kirsalinda bel agrisi sikligini %50.7 olarak saptamislardir. Ileri yas kadin cinsiyet ve agir yuk kaldirmanin, bel agrisi ile iliskili oldugunu bildirmislerdir. Altinel ve ark. [24] Afyon'daki calismasinda hayat boyu bel agrisi prevalansi %47, kronik bel agrisi prevalansini %16 olarak bildirilmis ve kronik bel agrili hastalarin cogunlugunun kadin oldugunu, fakat cinsiyet ve kilo farkliliginin bel agrisi riskini arttirmadigini saptamislardir. Eryavuz ve ark. [25] calismasinda yasam boyu agri prevalansi %54 (kadinlarda %62.7, erkeklerde %51.8) olarak bulunurken, kadin olgularda yasam boyu bel agrisina yakalanma sikligi erkeklere gore anlamli derecede yuksek saptanmistir. Bizim calismamizda da bel agrili hastalarin yas ortalamasi 55.8 [+ or -] 13.7'dir. Ileri yastaki ([greater than or equal to] 65 yas) hastalarla kiyaslandiginda, genc hastalarda bel agrisi ayni siklikta gorulmustur. Poliklinigimize basvuran bel agrili hastalarin diger arastirmalara gore ileri yasta olmalari, hastalarimizda kronik bel agrili hastalarin coklugu yaninda girisim yapilacak ve spondiloz, faset eklem dejenerasyonu, intradiskal patoloji, dar spinal kanal gibi ileri yas patolojisine sahip hastalarin cokluguna baglanabilir. Bel agrili hastalarimizin cogunlugu kadindir, fakat cinsiyetle bel agrisi arasinda anlamli iliski bulunamamistir.
Sigaranin kemik mineral icerigini azaltarak osteopo-roza zemin hazirladigini, vertebral govdeye kan akimini azaltip disklerin metabolizmasini bozdugunu ve yaralanmalara daha hassas bir ortam hazirladigi bilinmektedir. [26] Boshuzien ve ark. [27] sigara nedeniyle oksurmenin bel agrisi icin risk faktoru olusturdugunu savunmuslardir. Feldman ve ark. [28] bel agrisinda risk faktorlerini arastirdiklari calismalarinda, sigara kullananlarda yaklasik 2.5 kat daha fazla bel agrisi goruldugunu bildirmislerdir.
Eryavuz ve ark.nin [25] Istanbul'da yaptiklari calismada, sigara ve alkol kullanimi ile bel agrisi arasinda iliski bulunamamistir. Wallersted ve ark.nin [29] calismasinda ise alkol bagimliligi ile kronik bel agrisi iliskili bulunmustur. Bizim calismamizda sigara icenlerde bel agrisinin arttigi saptanmis, fakat alkol kullanimi ile bel agrisi arasinda bir iliski bulunamamistir.
Aile ici gecimsizlik, cocuklardan kaynaklanan sorunlar, ailesi ile birlikte yasama, tek basina yasama veya aile desteginden yoksun olma bel agrisi riskini arttirabilir. Is stresi agri esigini dusurur, agrili kas gerginligi yapar, kisinin psikolojik ve emosyonel durumunu olumsuz yonde etkiler ve bel agrisi sikligini arttirir. Matsui ve ark.nin [30] yaptigi arastirmada 3042 iscide bel agrisi riski ile is ortami iliskisi arastirilmis, bel agrisinin yasam boyu prevalansinin calisma kosullariyla iliskili oldugu, en fazla riskin agir kaldiranlarda oldugu gosterilmistir. Stres kaynakli dikkat daginikligi is kazalarina bagli bel agrisina neden olabilir. Calisma suresinin fazlaligi, belli surede yetistirilmesi gereken isin fazlaligi, isi sevmeme, is arkadaslari ve yoneticilerle diyalog eksikligi ve destek alamama psikofiziksel risk faktorlerindendir.
Eryavuz ve ark. [25] calismasinda bel agrsinin iscilerde, ek hizmet calisanlarinda yoneticilere gore anlamli derecede yuksek bulunmustur. Yapilan cok yonlu analizde kronik bel agrisinin, evli veya bosanmis olanlarda 4.79 kat fazla oldugu saptanmistir. Bizim calismamizda evli hastalarin %27.4 'unde, bekar hastalarin ise %19.9 'unda bel agrisina rastlandi fakat istatistiki bir anlam bulunamadi.
Dusuk egitim duzeyindeki kisiler, genelde ergono-mik olarak uygun olmayan ortamlarda calisir. Agir fiziksel aktivite gerektiren meslek grubundadirlar. Bu nedenlerle egitim duzeyi yuksek olanlara gore, bel agrisi icin daha fazla risk tasirlar. Burdorf ve ark. [31] calismasinda egitim duzeyi dusuklugu, sigara bagimliligi ve yas, bel agrisiyla iliskili bulunmustur. Eryavuz ve ark.nin calismasinda bel agrili hastalarin %79'u ilkogrenim ve alti duzeyde egitim gormusken, %21'i lise ve uzeri egitime sahipti. Bel agrisi ile egitim duzeyi arasinda iliski bulunamazken, gecim sikintisi olanlarda maddi sikintisi olmayanlara gore bel agrisi anlamli derecede yuksek bulunmustur. Calismamizda bel agrili hastalarin %70.5'i ilkogrenim ve alti duzeyinde egitim gormusken, %29.5'i lise ve uzeri egitim gordugu ve bunun anlamli oldugu saptandi. Ekonomik durumla bel agrisi arasindaki iliskinin istatistik anlamli oldugu, bu farkin dusuk sosyoekonomik durumdaki kisilerin daha cok fiziksel guc gerektiren islerde calismasina baglanmistir.
Bulgularimiza gore dusuk ekonomik duzey, dusuk egitim duzeyi ve sigara kullanimi ile bel agrisi arasinda anlamli iliski bulunmustur. Belirlenen risk faktorlerini azaltmaya yonelik onlemlerin alinmasi ile maddi kayba neden olan ve gunluk yasam akti-vitelerini engelleyen bel agrisi sikliginin bir olcude azaltilabilecegini dusunmekteyiz.

 ---------------------------------------------- 
Henry Watts was a microscopist, botanist, marine biologist and a manufacturer of perfumes made from distilling flowers. Before this latter occupation, he was a bootmaker. The first record we have of Watts was his setting up a bootmaking shop in Warrnambool in 1858 and, in the same year, giving a lecture to the Warrnambool Mechanics Institute on 'The Microscope. In regard to Watts' lecture, O'Callaghan (2006: 43) wrote:
Watts was an avid collector of small specimens that he found in fresh and sea water along the coast of Warrnambool. He seemed especially interested in microscopic organisms such as diatoms, and in December 1859 wrote as follows to Professor Quekett of London (Fig. 1):
At the time, John Thomas Quekett (1815-1861) was regarded as one of the world's leading microscopists. The Quekett Microscopical Club was established in 1865 in his honour and continues today. A biography of Quekett (Anon 1972) notes his fondness for natural history when young but as well as in the construction and use of microscopes. He trained as a surgeon, qualifying in 1840 and then completed a three-year studentship in Human and Comparative Anatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons. It was during this stint that he made some 2500 microscopical slides. He published extensively on histology as well as microscopy and received many samples sent to him for microscopical examination--including those from Watts, who asked that they be passed on to members of the Microscopical Club.
We have no idea what then happened to Watts' letter to Quekett and its contents, but they (the letter and some five packets) appeared somewhat mysteriously at a London auction at an unknown date. The letter had been typed (misspelling Quekett's name as Quickett) and mounted on stiff card, along with the original letter and the packets of diatoms (Fig. 1). They were purchased for [pounds sterling]12 10s by a Miss Eddey who was a 'Melbourne book proprietress' according to the framed artefact; Miss Eddey then donated the objects to the Warrnambool Field Naturalists Club at a meeting in 1976 via Mr Beaton. In 2005, the material was donated to the Warrnambool and District Historical Society (Heathcote 2008). We plan to have the diatoms examined by experts and report on the findings in due course.
But what else do we know of Mr Henry Watts? O'Callaghan (2006) noted that Watts investigated the guano in Warrnambool's Starlight bat cave, expecting to find microscopic algae but instead, not surprisingly, found arthropod skeletal remains. We also know that in 1861 he sent a collection of more than 100 seaweeds for an exhibition in Melbourne. This was a momentous occasion and the catalogue was prefaced by Baron Sir Ferdinand von Mueller and Professor Frederick McCoy (among others) (Government of the Colony of Victoria 1861).
The Examiner, Warrnambool's local newspaper, was very excited by his work, noting it was 'really refreshing in these degenerate days to find someone with a soul elevated above mere worldly gain' (O'Callaghan 2006: 43). Watts made further contributions to the study of algae by reading a paper entitled 'Fresh water algae of Victoria' at a meeting of the Royal Society of Victoria (RSV) in Melbourne in 1862 and a year later exhibited fossil polyzoa (now called bryozoa or ectoprocta) at an RSV meeting. In 1863, the Examiner also noted that Watts had been made an honorary corresponding member of the Bristol Microscopical Society (O'Callaghan 2006).
Watts and his perfumes
Henry Watts was also very interested in flowers and in 1864 his exhibit at the Warrnambool Horticultural Society Show, of a water plant in flower, generated much interest. His love of flowers spurred him to change occupations from bootmaking to growing flowers for sale from his home in Warrnambool. He then moved into making perfumes, including his 'Warrnambool Posy, which he sold for two shillings: 'a delicious perfume for the handkerchief'. In 1865 Watts won prizes for his perfumes at the annual Spring Exhibition of the Horticultural Society of Victoria and again at the Ballarat Horticultural Society Show in 1866, where jurors commented that his perfumes were 'superior to the greater portion of the imported perfumers' (O'Callaghan 2006: 44). In the same year he showed 44 perfumes at Melbourne, displayed in a cabinet made by Stelling Bros, Warrnambool. But he had not forgotten his seaweeds and sent these and microscopical specimens to the 1866 Melbourne Exhibition.
The correspondent at The Leader newspaper was glowing in praise of Watts' perfumes (Anon 1866a: 7):
Watts certainly captured the interest of The Australasian's correspondent during the Exhibition. The paper subsequently noted (Anon 1866b: 7) that Watts was Victoria's only regular manufacturer and trader in perfumes and that at the Exhibition he gave samples freely to ladies who 'are thus carrying away with them from the Exhibition evidences of his success'. This was followed by a detailed description on how the perfumes were made, stressing the care Watts devoted to using flowers with delicate colours, like roses and wattles. Here he
The article also notes the many awards Watts had received for his perfumes, including a [pounds sterling]50 grant to help establish his business. O'Callaghan (2006: 44) indicates this was from the Victorian New Industry Commission that noted Watts was
Watts must have also exhibited his previously mentioned polyzoa and apparently agreed to a request by the Director of the National Museum to donate the collection to that institution. Watts' perfumes also generated a humorous article in the Melbourne Punch that noted (Anon 1865: 2):
Watt's contributions to science
Watts was an active member of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria from its inception. He was the Club's first librarian, from 1881-82, then its Vice-President for one year, and a member of the Club's Committee for a further year (Anon 1890). He also published in the first volume of The Victorian Naturalist (Maiden 1908), eventually writing a further three papers for the Club's journal over the next three years.
Whilst Watts' published works were somewhat modest, with only six papers published (see Appendix), his contributions to science were nevertheless important, especially in terms of some significant collections of algae. Watts collected marine and freshwater algae from around Warrnambool, and later collected freshwater algae from Ballarat and aquatic environments in the Yarra River basin. The marine algal specimens were sent to Dublin University's Professor William Henry Harvey, and the freshwater algae to Ferdinand von Mueller, who passed them on to Friedrich Kutzing and C F Otto for identification (Wikipedia 2019). Furthermore, von Mueller named a species of wattle after him (Acacia wattsiana) and Harvey named two algal species in his honour-Wrangelia wattsii and Crouania wattsii. Harvey included the marine algae sent to him by Watts in his Phycologia australica (1858-1863).
Harvey met von Mueller when he visited Melbourne in the spring of 1854 and in early summer of that year collected seaweeds along the Victorian coastline from Phillip Island to Port Fairy (Willis 1990). It is not known whether Watts actually met Harvey in 1854 as it is uncertain where Watts was living at the time. Nevertheless, the fact that Watts sent the specimens to Harvey directly (rather than via von Mueller) suggests that Watts possibly knew Harvey personally.
Despite Watts being described as the 'pioneer of freshwater phycology in Victoria', by Entwisle (1990), that same author has noted Watts' work had some severe limitations. These included the inability of workers in the field to determine or verify the species; and the loss of many of the materials Watts used. Indeed, most of his specimens were apparently lost while he was ill (Anon 1890) although the National Herbarium of Victoria does possess some dry voucher specimens (Entwisle 1990).
Overall, there was a lack of authorities provided for names of species Watts identified. It seems that while Watts had some freshwater species identified by authorities in the field (Kiitzing, Otto, Norstedt), he identified most himself using published accounts from Europe and North America--which Entwisle (1990) considers inappropriate in many cases.
Financial woes
Despite the popularity of his perfumes, Watts failed to generate sufficient income to stave off his creditors, and in 1867 lost his equipment to the Sheriff and was declared bankrupt in the Geelong court (Anon 1867). A year later Watts moved to Melbourne where he set up another perfume distillery (even advertising in Warrnambool for a supplier of Bursaria spinosa), but it seems that business also fell apart (O'Callaghan 2006). In 1868 Watts was again mentioned in court, but this time as the innocent buyer of stolen perfume bottles (Anon 1868). Two years later Watts appealed against a court order sending him to gaol as he failed to pay his wife maintenance of 15 shillings a week following their separation. The appeal was upheld on the grounds Watts genuinely could not pay the sum, although costs of [pounds sterling]3 3s were awarded against him (Anon 1870).
Watts was eventually discharged from insolvency in 1873 (Anon 1873).
Later life
Henry Watts spent the final year of his life (1889) in the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum, suffering from dementia and paralysis. Following his death in 1889, an obituary was published in The Victorian Naturalist (Anon 1890). It mentions that, in his later years, he spent much time microscopically examining botanical, zoological and geological materials and had accumulated a large quantity of specimens and slides. As mentioned above, when he became increasingly ill many of these materials were lost--a great pity as they may well have proved useful for examination by later scientists and naturalists.

 ---------------------------------------------- 
Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the patients who admitted to algology polyclinic with malign and non-malign pain, sociodemographic characteristics, type of pain and pain management retrospectively.
Methods: In this study we examined the medical assessement files of patients who admitted to our outpatient clinic of Algology Department for chronic pain between January 2000- December 2010. The sociodemographic characteristics of the patients, pain properties and treatments were reviewed retrospectively.
Results: Within the eleven years period, a total of 6647 patients have been admitted to our clinic. 66.9% of the patients were between the ages of 19 and 64. There was no significant difference between gender. The most common causes of pain were myofascial pain, neuropathic pain, low back pain and headache. Among malignancy related cases the most common sources were gastrointenstinal system, lung and breast regions. In 83.4% of patients, pharmacological and invasive treatments were utilized. The most common invasive treatment modalities were, trigger point injection, dry needle application and epidural catheter application.
Conclusion: In conclusion, pain treatments with multidisciplinary approach applied by the increasing number of pain clinics provide favorouble results and patients quality of life is also increased. We hope our retrospective study may provide helpful data for future studies on chronic pain with its comprehensive base of patient data which covers an eleven years period.
Key words: Treatment; chronic pain; prevalance; sociodemographic characteristics.
Amac: Bu calismanin amaci, malign ve non-malign agri sikayeti ile basvuran hastalarin agri tipleri, sosyodemografik ozellikleri ile agri tedavilerinin geriye donuk olarak degerlendirilmesidir.
Gerec ve Yontem: Calismamizda Ocak 2000-Aralik 2010 tarihleri arasinda algoloji bilim dali poliklinigine kronik agri yakinmasi ile basvuran hastalarin dosyalari incelendi. Hastalarin sosyodemografik ozellikleri, agri durumlari ve uygulanan tedaviler dosyalarindan geriye donuk olarak degerlendirildi.
Bulgular: On bir yillik sure icerisinde poliklinigimize toplam 6647 hasta basvurdugu goruldu. Hastalarin %66.9'u 19-64 yas araliginda idi. Hastalarin cinsiyetleri arasinda fark yoktu. En sik non-malign agri nedenleri; miyofasiyal agri, noropatik agri, bel agrisi ve bas agrisiydi. Malign agri nedeniyle basvuran hastalarda en sik gastrointestinal sistem kaynakli kanser, akciger kanseri ve meme kanseri goruldu. Farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi hastalarin %83.4'une uygulandigi tespit edildi. En cok yapilan invaziv tedavi; tetik nokta enjeksiyonu, kuru igneleme ve epidural kateter takilmasi oldugu saptandi.
Sonuc: Sonuc olarak, sayilari gittikce artan algoloji kliniklerinin agriya multidisipliner yaklasimla uyguladiklari tedavilerle elde edilen sonuclar yuz guldurmektedir ve hastanin yasam kalitesi de artmaktadir. On bir yillik genis bir zaman dilimini icermesi nedeniyle calismamizin bundan sonraki kronik agri calismalari icin iyi bir veri kaynagi olacagini dusunmekteyiz.
Anahtar sozcukler: Tedavi; kronik agri; prevelans; sosyodemografik ozellikler.
Giris
Insanlik tarihiyle yasit olan agri kavraminin gunumuzdeki en gecerli tanimini Uluslararasi Agri Arastirmalari Dernegi (International Association for the Study of Pain=IASP) tarafindan yapilmistir. IASP'nin tanimina gore agri; var olan veya olasi doku hasarina eslik eden veya bu hasar ile tanimlanabilen, hosa gitmeyen duysal ve emosyonel deneyim olarak tanimlanmistir. [1] Agri, objektif, subjektif, duyusal ve psikojenik kompenentler icermektedir ve bu nedenle agriya verilen yanit kisiden kisiye degismekte, hatta ayni kiside bile farkli olabilmektedir.
Agrinin tedavisi icin gerek medikal gerekse invaziv girisimler uygulanmakta ve agri tedavisine buyuk paralar harcanmaktadir. Agri nedeniyle bireyler gunluk aktivitelerini yapamadiklari gibi kronik agri ceken insanlar da psikososyal ve davranissal bir takim bozukluklar olusmakta ve hatta bu insanlar hayata kusmektedir. Bu acilardan bakildiginda toplumsal bir sorun olan agri, sosyal ve ekonomik bir sorun olarak da kabul edilmelidir.
Bu calismadaki amacimiz Ocak 2000-Aralik 2010 tarihleri arasinda algoloji bilim dali poliklinigine agri nedeni ile basvuran olgularin incelenerek verdigimiz hizmetlerin saptanmasi, uygulanan tedavilerin belirlenmesi, ayrica agri poliklinigimize basvuran hasta populasyonunun sosyodemografik ozelliklerinin ve agri durumlarinin, dunyada ve ulkemizde yapilmis diger agri calismalari ile benzerliklerini ve farkliliklarini ortaya koymaktir.
Gerec ve Yontem
Bu calismada, algoloji bilim dali poliklinigine Ocak 2000-Aralik 2010 tarihleri arasinda agri nedeni ile basvuran 3315'i erkek, 3332'si kadin toplam 6647 hastanin dosyasi incelendi. Etik kurul izni alindiktan sonra, algoloji bilim dalinda arsivlenen poliklinik dosyalari geriye donuk olarak taranarak, veriler kaydedildi.
Hastalarin yas gruplari, cinsiyeti (kadin/erkek), ilk basvuru tarihleri (yillara gore), basvuru sekilleri (kendiliginden/referansla gelme), agrinin nedeni (malign ve bening sebepler), malign agrida metastaz olup olmadigi, uygulanan tedavi sekli (farmakolojik, non-farmakolojik) ve uygulanan invaziv tedavileri (epidural steroid, epidural kateter, TENS vb) kaydettik.
Calismaya alinan verilerin istatistiksel analizi "Statistical Package for Social Scienies (SPSS) for Windows 16.0" paket programi kullanilarak yapildi. Veriler, sayi ve yuzde olarak ifade edildi. Gruplarin karsilastirilmasinda ki-kare testi kullanildi. P<0.05 olan degerler anlamli kabul edildi.
Bulgular
Calismamizda degerlendirmeye alinan algoloji poliklinigine basvuran 6647 hastanin 160'i 18 yas ve alti, 4447'si 19-64 yas arasi, 2040'i 65 yas ve ustu bulundu (Tablo 1). Hastalarin 3332'si kadin, 3315'i ise erkekti ve 2868'si kendiliginden, 3779'u ise referansla klinige geldigi belirlendi.
Uc bin yedi yuz kanser (CA) agrili hastanin malignite cinslerine gore dagilimi incelendiginde, en sik gastrointestinal sistem kaynakli (GIS) CA (%19.7) daha sonra akciger CA (%18.3) ve ucuncu siklikla meme CA (%8.0) oldugu goruldu (Tablo 2). Malign agrisi olan hastanin %57.0'da metastaz mevcuttu.
Non-malign agri nedenleri arasinda en sik miyofasyal agri (%22.6), ikinci siklikla noropatik agri (%21.2) ve ucuncu siklikla bel agrisi (%15.7) tespit edildi (Tablo 3). Malign ve nonmalign hastalara uygulanan tedaviler degerlendirildiginde; 5540 hastaya (%83.4) farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi, 933 hastaya (%14.0) ise sadece invaziv tedavi uygulandigi goruldu. Invaziv tedavi girisimleri Sekil 1'de gosterildi.
Calismamiza aldigimiz 3700 malign agrisi olan hastanin yas gruplarina gore tedavi oranlarina bakildiginda, 18 yas ve alti hastalarin %97.4'une, 19-64 yas arasi hastalarin %96.9'una, 65 yas ve ustu hastalarin %97.4'une farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi verildigi goruldu (Tablo 4). Malign agrisi olan 3700 hastadan, 2257 erkek hastanin %97.5'ine, 1443 kadin hastanin %96.5'ine farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi uygulandigi kaydedildi (Sekil 2).
Bas agrisi nedeni ile basvuran 433 hastanin yas gruplarina gore tedavi sekillerine bakildiginda 65 yas ve ustu olan gruptaki hastalarin %80'ine farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi uygulanirken, %16.2'sine sadece invaziv tedavi uygulandigi; bunun da iki grup arasinda istatistiksel olarak farkli oldugu bulundu (p<0.05) (Tablo 5). Bas agrisi sikayeti ile basvuran hastalarin cinsiyetlerine gore tedavi oranlari Sekil 3'de gorulmektedir.
Bel agrisi olan 463 hastanin yas gruplarina gore tedavi oranlari Tablo 6'da gosterildi. Bel agrisi sikayeti ile poliklinige basvuran 463 hastanin 306'si kadin, 157'si erkekti. Bel agrisi nedeni ile tedavi olan erkek hastalarin %63.1'ine farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi, %35'ine sadece invaziv tedavi uygulandigi; kadin hastalarin %62.7'sine farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi, %34.6'sina sadece invaziv tedavi uygulandigi tespit edildi (Sekil 4).
Noropatik agri nedeni ile basvuran hastalarin yas gruplarina gore tedavi oranlari incelendiginde; 1964 yas grubunda 326 hastaya farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi, 49 hastaya sadece invaziv tedavi uygulandigi, 11 hastanin ise sevk edildigi goruldu (Tablo 7). Noropatik agrisi olan 624 hastadan; erkek hastalarin %88.7'sine, kadin hastalarin ise %85.7'sine farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi uygulandigi saptandi (Sekil 5).
Miyofasyal agri tanisi alan hastalarin yas gruplarina gore tedavi sekillerine baktigimizda, grup ici farklilik yoktu (Tablo 8). Poliklinigimizde miyofasyal agri tanisi ile tedavi olan erkek hastalarin %50'sine, kadin hastalarin %50.8'ine sadece invaziv tedavi yapildigi tespit edildi (Sekil 6).
Tartisma
Akut ve kronik agri sikayeti olan hastalarin cogu tum dunyada yetersiz olarak tedavi edilmektedir. Kronik agri ve kanser agrisi ceken hastalarin sayisi gun gectikce artmakta, yasli populasyon daha uzun sure yasamaktadir. Hastalarin gunluk yasamlarinin agrisiz, rahat ve konforlu olmasi icin agri hastalarinin, ozellikli bakim ve tedavisi gerekmektedir. Bu bakim ve tedavi agri konusunda uzmanlasmis kisiler tarafindan saglanabilir. Bu amacla ulkemizde ve dunyada agri poliklinikleri acilmistir. Agri poliklinikleri, agri ceken hastalari multidisipliner yaklasimla tedavi eden merkezlerdir. Ulkemizde ilk agri unitesi 1986 yilinda acilmis, 1990 yilinda bilim dali olmustur.
Agri hosa gitmeyen bir duyumdur ve hastalari doktora getiren nedenlerin basinda gelir. Celiker ve ark. [2] hastalarin ust solunum yolu enfeksiyonu sonrasi en fazla doktora basvuru sikayetinin agri oldugunu bildirmislerdir. Agri prevalansi konusunda belirgin bir fikir birligi yoktur. Ancak agrinin tum insanlari etkiledigi aciktir. Vucutta agri bolgesini ve agriyi ifade etme ile hissedilen agri siddeti ve agriyla bas etme yontemleri, sosyokulturel ve bilissel ozelliklerden etkilenmekte farkli kulturlerde agri farkli ifade edilmekte ve farkli ozelliklerle ortaya cikmaktadir.
Kisilerin agri deneyimi bireye ve topluma gore degisir, farkli toplumlarda ve farkli orneklemelerle yapilan calismalarin sonuclari da degisiklikler gostermektedir. Goldberg ve McGee'ye[3] gore kronik agri ceken insan sikligi her yil %10 artmaktadir. Agrinin nedeninin bulunup tedavi edilmesi gunumuzde bireyin yasam kalitesinin artirilmasi acisindan onemlidir.
Calismamiza alinan 6647 hastanin %50.1'i kadin, %49.9'u erkekti. Ayvat ve ark.nin[4] algoloji bolumune basvuran hastalari degerlendirdikleri geriye donuk calismalarinda erkek hastalarin oranini %37.3, kadin hastalarin oranini ise %63.7 olarak bulmuslardir. Dicle Universitesi Algoloji Poliklinigine 2008 yilinda basvuran hastalari degerlendiren bir calismada, kronik benign agrili hastalarin %59'u, baska bir calismada ise hastalarin %61.8'i kadin olarak bildirilmistir. [5,6] Saglikli bireylerde yapilan bazi psikofiziksel calismalarda, kadinlarda erkeklere gore agri esiginin daha dusuk oldugu, agri siddetinin daha yuksek olarak degerlendirildigi ve agri toleransinin daha az oldugu gosterilmistir. [7,8] Hem bizim calismamizda hem de diger calismalarda gorulmustur ki istatistiksel olarak farklilik olmamasina ragmen agri unitelerine kadin hastalar daha cok basvurmaktadir. Bunu kadinlarin agri bildirimine ve sagliklari ile ilgili yardim istemeye daha yatkin olmalarina, agriyi daha kolay dile getirebilmelerine ve erkeklerin yasadiklari agriyi anlatma konusunda daha cekinik kalmalarina baglayabiliriz.
Gaziantep Universitesi Agri Unitesi'ne 2001-2007 yilinda basvuran hastalarin geriye donuk olarak degerlendirildigi bir calismada hastalarin direkt olarak agri unitesine basvuru orani %48.8 olarak rapor edilmistir. [9] Hastalarimizin %43.1'i kendiliginden, %56.9'u diger merkezlerlerden referansla gonderilmistir. Agri unitelerinin toplumda bilinirliligi ve sayisi arttikca hastalarin multidisipliner tedaviye daha kisa zamanda ulasacagini dusunmekteyiz.
Poliklinigimize kanser agrisi nedeniyle basvuran hasta orani %55 iken, kanser disi agri nedeniyle basvuran hasta orani %45'tir. Kronik agri tanimi ve tedavi secenekleri degistikce kronik agri ceken hastalarin agri unitesine basvurma orani da artmistir. Yegul'e gore agri unitelerine baslangicta kanser agrisi nedeniyle basvuran hasta orani %95 iken gunumuzde bu oran degiserek kanser disi agrilar lehine artmistir. [10]
Cocelli ve ark.nin[9] yaptiklari calismada, agri unitesine basvuran 4863 hasta degerlendirilmis ve bunlarin %42'sinin kanser hastasi oldugu rapor edilmistir. Bizim calismamizda ise kanser agrisi nedeniyle poliklinigimize basvuran hasta orani %55 olarak bulundu. Zamanla agri unitelerinin bilinirliginin artmasi ve kanser disi agri sikayeti olan hastalarinda direkt algolojiye basvuruda bulunmasi nedeniyle kanser hastalarinin oraninin azalmasi normal karsilanabilir. Bizim calismamizda ise kanser agrisi nedeniyle basvuran hastalarin oraninin yuksek bulunmasinin sebebi, hasta sayisinin fazla olmasi, hastane olarak genis bir alana hizmet vermemiz ve malign hasta populasyonumuzun cevre illerden sevklerle birlikte fazla olmasina bagli oldugunu dusunmekteyiz.
Dunyada en sik gorulen kanser turu sirasiyla akciger, meme ve kolorektal kanserlerdir. [11] Kanser hastalarinda kanser hucrelerinin mekanik basisi, sinirlere infiltrasyonu, organ metastazlari (kemik, lenf bezi, beyin gibi) tedaviyle iliskili (ameliyata, kemoterapiye, radyoterapiye bagli) nedenler agriya yol acabilir. Tum kanser hastalarinda agri orani %53 iken tedavi sonrasi agri orani %43 olarak rapor edilmistir. [12,13] Aslan ve ark.nin [14] calismalarinda agri unitesine basvuran kanserli hastalarda en sik kolon-rektum kanseri, ikinci sirada akciger kanseri oldugunu bildirmislerdir. Esener ve ark.nin fakultemizde 1993 yilinda yaptigi calismada, algoloji poliklinigine hastalarin en sik akciger kanseri, mide kanseri ve lenfoma nedeniyle basvurdugunu yayinlamislardir. [15] Bizim calismamizda ise literature benzer olarak en sik izlenen kanser turleri sirasiyla gastrointestinal sistem kanserleri, akciger kanseri, meme kanseri ve prostat kanseridir. Esener ve ark.nin calismasina gore siralamadaki degisikligi, hastalara daha erken tani konulmasi nedeni ile meme ve prostat kanserlerinin toplumdaki sikliginin artmasi ve son yillarda lenfoma hastalarinin agri palyasyonu gereksiniminin azalmasi olabilir.
Kanser agrisi nedeniyle poliklinigimize basvuran hastalarin %97.1'ine farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi verildigi saptandi. Klinigimizde Dunya Saglik Orgutu'nun 1986 yilinda onerdigi basamak tedavisi prensiplerine gore farmakolojik tedavi uygulanmaktadir. Hastanin sikayetleri ve klinigi goz onunde bulundurularak gereginde invaziv tedaviler medikal tedavinin devaminda veya ilk secenek olarak uygulanmaktadir.
Non-malign agri nedenleri Chung ve Wong [16] agri sikayeti olan hastalarda yaptiklari calismada en sik agri yakinmasinin bel agrisi (%22.2), bas agrisi (%19.9), ust ekstremite agrisi (%18.5), alt ekstremite agrisi (%16.4), karin agrisi (%11.3) oldugunu bildirmislerdir. Ulkemizde yapilan calismalarda ise Kuru ve ark. en cok agri yakinmasinin sirasiyla omuz, bel, boyun, sirt ve diz bolgesi oldugunu belirtmislerdir. [17] Erdine ve ark. [18] ise en cok agri tanimlanan bolgeleri sirasiyla bas, bel ve alt ekstremite olarak rapor etmislerdir. Bizim calismamizda ise en sik agri yakinmalari, miyofasyal agri (%22.6), noropatik agri (%21.2), bel agrisi (%15.7) ve bas agrisi (%14.7) olarak gozlendi.
Agri lokalizasyonu ve yas arasindaki iliskiyi inceleyen Elliott ve ark.nin [19] calismasinda en sik agri sikayetinin bel ve eklem agrisi oldugunu, bel agrisinin genc yas grupta ve erkeklerde sik izlenirken, eklem agrisinin ileri yas grubunda ve bayanlarda sik goruldugu bildirilmistir. Calismamizda 18 yas ve alti grupta en sik agri nedeni vaskuler kaynakli agri, 19-64 yas arasi grupta miyofasyal kaynakli agri, 65 yas ve ustu grupta ise noropatik kaynakli agri oldugunu gorduk. Inceledigimiz hastalarin %66.9'unun 1964 yas arasi olmasi, %50.1'inin bayan olmasi nedeni ile tum agri tiplerinin bayanlarda ve 19-64 yas grubunda daha fazla oldugunu saptadik.
Bas agrisi sikayeti ile basvuran 433 hastaya uygulanan tedavi sekilleri incelendiginde 65 yas ve ustu grupta farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi %80 iken, sadece invaziv tedavi %16.2 oraninda yapildigi kaydedildi. Cinsiyetlerine gore tedavi oranlari arasinda farklilik bulunmadi.
Bel agrisi sikayeti ile basvuran 463 hastanin, %62.9'u farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi alirken, %34.8'ine sadece invaziv tedavi uygulandigi, %2.4 sevk edildigi goruldu. Bel agrisi sikayeti ile tedavi verilen erkek hastalarin %63.1'ine, kadin hastalarin ise %62.7'sine farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi uygulandigi gozlendi.
Noropatik agri nedeni ile basvuran 624 hastanin 342'si kadin, 282'si erkekti. Butun yas gruplarinda farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavinin (%87) daha fazla uygulandigi goruldu. Tedavi oranlari incelendiginde kadinlarla erkekler arasinda fark yoktu.
Miyofasyal agri nedeni ile basvuran 666 hastanin 518'i kadin, 148'i erkekti. Kadin hastalarin %47.1'ine farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi, %50.8'ine sadece invaziv tedavi uygulandigi, erkek hastalarin %48.6'sina farmakolojik ve invaziv tedavi, %50'sine sadece invaziv tedavi uygulandigi saptandi.
Poliklinigimizde kanser ve kanser disi hastalara uygulanan invaziv tedavi yontemlerini inceledigimizde, %27.4 tetik nokta enjeksiyonu, %24.8 kuru igneleme, %12.3 epidural katater, %10.5 periferik sinir blogu, %8.2 epidural steroid uygulandigini gorduk. Daha nadir olarak radyofrekans (RF), sempatik blok, TENS, vaskuler port ve spinal kateter uygulandi.
Gul ve Onal, [20] miyofasyal agri sikayeti olan hastalarda invazif ve non-invazif teknikler kullanarak tedavi etkinligini degerlendirdiklerinde botilinum-a tetik nokta enjeksiyonunun, lidokain tetik nokta enjeksiyonuna ve non-invazif yontemlerden TENS ve lasere karsi daha etkili oldugunu belirtmislerdir. Bubnov, [21] miyofasiyal agrisi olan hastalarda kuru igneleme etkinligini %93.3 olarak bulmustur. Kuru igneleme etkinliginin uzun sureli agri, yuksek agri siddeti, stres ve uyku bozuklugu ile ters orantili oldugunu soyleyen calismalar da bulunmaktadir. [22]
Karaman ve ark. [23] kronik agrisi olan hastalara radyofrekans tedavisi uygulamislar ve hastalari 8.5 ay sureyle takip ettiklerinde radyofrekans yontemiyle hastalarin VAS degerlerinde %55.6 ile %75 arasinda dusus oldugunu bildirmislerdir. Kronik diz agrisi olan hastalarda radyofrekans tedavisi kullanildiginda, hastalarda islem sonrasi ucuncu ve altinci ayda agrilarin belirgin azaldigi ve hicbir yan etkinin olmadigi bildirilmistir. [24]
TENS tedavisi, agrida kullanildigi zaman baslangicta etkili olurken aradan zaman gecince agri yeniden baslayabilir. [25] Oosterhof ve ark., [26] kronik agri ceken hastalarda TENS'in bir yil sonraki etkisini arastirmis ve bir yil sonra plasebo ile TENS arasinda istatistiksel olarak bir fark olmadigini bildirmislerdir. Agri klinikleri son yillarda gelisme kaydederek kronik agri ceken insanlara tedavi imkani saglamis olmasina ragmen yine de en gelismis ulkelerde bile dogru tedavi imkanina ulasamayan %5-10 kadar bir hasta grubu bulunmaktadir. [27] Bircok degisik nedenlerle ortaya cikabilen agrinin, kisi tarafindan ifade edilisi yas, cinsiyet ve agri davranisi ile ilgili sosyal ve kulturel ozellikler gibi degisik faktorlerden etkilenmektedir. [28] Agrinin algilanmasi kisiye gore degisir. Kuru ve ark. [17] yapmis olduklari calismada hastalarin %38'inin agrisi oldugu halde agriyi dindirmek icin hicbir sey yapmadiklarini bildirmislerdir. Multidisipliner yaklasimla degerlendirilmeyen hastalar, eksik veya yetersiz tedavi alabilmekte ve multidisipliner bakis acisiyla yeterli tedavi edilmeyen agri kroniklesmektedir. Kroniklesmemis olan agrinin tedavisi daha kisa zaman alacak boylece hastalarin agri cektikleri sure kisalacak; gereksiz, fazla ve uzun sureli ilac kullanimi azaltilarak ulke ekonomisine dolayli yollardan katki saglanmis olacakti.
Sonuc olarak, gunumuzde sayilari gittikce artan agri klinikleri ve agriya multidisipliner yaklasimla uygulanan tedavilerle elde edilen sonuclar yuz guldurmekte, hastanin yasam kalitesi artmaktadir. Calismamizda, verdigimiz hizmetlerin saptanmasi, uygulanan tedavilerin ortaya konulmasi; ayrica agri poliklinigimize basvuran hasta populasyonunun sosyodemografik ozelliklerini ile agri durumlarini ortaya koymak amaclanmistir.

Abstract
Background
The Mediterranean Region holds significant ecological importance, characterised by its unique climate, biodiversity and the crucial role it plays in global ecosystems. Mediterranean streams are naturally highly-stressed environments mainly due to fluctuations in water quantity. River flow generally varies from perennial to ephemeral and temporary rivers constitute significant water resources. Streams that flow through Balearic Islands are subjected to these conditions. The majority of these streams sustain water flow for 4-5 months annually, with exceptions noted for streams associated with springs, which typically maintain water throughout most of the year.
Benthic diatoms are widely recognised as reliable bioindicators of water quality, used in many aquatic ecosystems. Analysing diatom communities and their biodiversity serves as a valuable tool to ensure the ecological and sustainable utilisation of water resources as well as the accurate development of guidelines for their conservation.The field of diatom taxonomy and distribution plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of aquatic ecosystems and their biodiversity. Species of the genus Nitzschia are extensively found throughout the Mediterranean Region, including the Balearic Islands. However, they have rarely been investigated in temporary streams.
New information
This study presents the first record of Nitzschia transtagensis Morales, Novais, Wetzel, Morais & Ector, outside the type locality and being the second record in Europe. In this study, the authors found this taxon in one temporary stream of Majorca Island, Torrent des Castellot in November 2005 (Balearic Islands). Nitzschia transtagensis occurred at 2.6% abundance in this stream with oligotrophic waters (0.052 mgl[sup.-1] of nitrate), slightly alkaline pH values (7.8) and water conductivity levels of 626.5 S cm[sup.-1]. This species was recorded in the biofilm of the stones together with other taxa such as Achnanthidium minutissimum (Ktzing) Czarnecki (39.2%), Gomphonema rosenstockianum Lange-Bertalot & Reichardt (28.9%) and Halamphora oligotraphenta (Lange-Bertalot) Levkov (20.4%). The Nitzschia transtagensis frustules found in the examined material have similar dimensions and a higher fibulae count (8-11 in 10 [MU]m vs. 6-10 in 10 [MU]m) compared to the type material of Nitzschia transtagensis. The habitat characteristics in which this species was found are described, together with LM micrographs of this taxon.

Introduction
Species belonging to the genus Nitzschia Hassal are widely distributed in the Mediterranean Region, including the Balearic Islands. Nitzschia consists of 895 taxonomically-accepted species (Guiry and Guiry 2023), which have been found in a diverse range of habitats, both in the benthos and the plankton of freshwater, brackish and marine environments (Mucko et al. 2021). Nitzschia genus was first described in 1845 by Hassall, unifying all single-celled and colonial pennate diatoms with a linear to lanceolate (also sigmoid) shape of frustules and with a predominantly eccentric (sometimes centric) raphe subtended by siliceous bridges (Giulietti et al. 2021). Smith (1853) divided this large genus into six sections for the first time. Later, Cleve and Grunow (1880) further subdivided the genus Nitzschia into 24 sections, based mainly on the shape of the valves, organisation and structure of the fibulae and raphe position (Krammer and Lange-Bertalot 1988). Grunow's system is still in use with some modifications, particularly following Mann (1986) and Round et al. (1990). Mann (1986) reviewed the classification of Nitzschia and set up the subgenus Nitzschia, which is characterised by a complex structure of the valve near the raphe, with the presence of siliceous flaps, an undulate valve face and changes in valve structure beneath the conopeal canals. This unique combination, known as the canal-raphe-conopeum system, is not found in other groups of Nitzschia species. The Lineares group was first described by Grunow (1862), whereas Cleve (1883) was the first to assign sectional status to this group. Morales et al. (2019) described a new Nitzschia species in the Lineares section sensu Krammer and Lange-Bertalot (1988). The first record of Nitzschia transtagensis Morales, Novais, Wetzel, Morais & Ector occurred in a spring feeding the small creek Barranco do Joo Dias in the Portuguese region of Alentejo (Morales et al. 2019). Therefore, this study aims to increase the knowledge about the N. transtagensis habitat by describing the ecological data of a new locality and to provide light microscopy documentation of this species.
Materials and methods
Study area
The Balearic Islands (Fig. 1) possess a hydrological system comprising of temporary streams which are strongly influenced by the Mediterranean climate. These streams result from predictable and seasonal flooding and drying events during the annual hydrologic cycle. They tend to sustain a stable community between September-October towards April-May, after which they experience a prolonged period of approximately 4 months of drying. Information on land-use cover in the areas near the stream was estimated from CORINE land-cover maps (Bossard et al. 2000). The vast majority was dedicated to forested regions (70%) and agricultural activities (15%) and, to a lesser extent, to natural vegetation (15%).
This study is part of a larger project conducted during 2005-2006 which involved sampling 60 temporary streams located in the Balearic Islands (Spain) during different seasons (winter, spring and autumn) (Delgado et al. 2012).
Diatom samples
Water temperature (C), pH, dissolved oxygen (mg l-1) and electric conductivity (EC, S cm-1) were measured in situ using portable meters. Water chemical analyses followed the American Public Health Association methods (APHA 1989). BOD5 was measured using the oxitop WTW; alkalinity by the potentiometric method. For nutrient analysis, an Auto-Analyzer 3 (Bran + Luebbe, Germany) was used. Ions were measured using a spectrophotometer of masses, whereas chlorides (Cl-) and sulphates (SO4 2-) were quantified using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrophotometry (ICP-MS) (further information in Delgado et al. (2012)).
Epilithic diatoms were collected from stones using a small toothbrush, following European protocols (Kelly et al. 1998, AFNOR 2003, CEN - Comit Europen de Normalisation 2004). After collection, diatom samples were preserved with a formaldehyde solution (37%). Subsequently, they were digested using the procedure of Renberg (1990) with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and, following oxidation, permanent slides were prepared with Naphrax. A minimum number of 400 valves were identified and counted from each slide under a Nikon Eclipse E800 light microscope (LM), equipped with an immersion objective 100x (NA 1.40) to assess the relative abundance of taxa. Light micrographs were captured using a DS-U2 digital camera and NIS-Elements D 2.30 SP1 software (Nikon, Japan). The diatoms were identified at the lowest taxonomical level according to reference floras: Krammer and Lange-Bertalot (1991), Lange-Bertalot (1993), Krammer (1997a), Krammer (1997b), Lange-Bertalot et al. (2003), Hofmann et al. (2011), Lange-Bertalot et al. (2017).
To assess the ecological status, the most common diatom indices were calculated using the Omnidia software v. 5.3 (Lecointe et al. 2003): the Specific Polluosensitivity Index (IPS, CEMAGREF and AERMC (1982)), the Biological Diatom Index (IBD, Prygiel and Coste (1999)), the Trophic Diatom Index (TDI, Kelly and Whitton (1995)) the Commission for Economical Community Metric (CEE, Descy and Coste 1991), the Indice Diatomique Artois Pircardie (IDAP, Prygiel et al. (1996), Lecointe et al. (2003)) and the Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (H', Shannon and Weaver (1949)).

Description
Frustules with apical asymmetry with an undulated pattern on the secondary side (Fig. 2). Valves 34.6-40.0 [MU]m long, 4.0-5.3 [MU]m wide and fibula density 8-11/10 [MU]m (n = 13). It is noteworthy that striae are visible with LM in some specimens. Directing attention to the images in Figure 2, we highlight the species distinctive characteristics, including a convex primary (raphe) side with a slight undulated abvalvar edge of the mantle and clearly undulated secondary valve side. We believe the debris surrounding the Nitzschia specimens may be attributed to the calcareous geology of Majorca. In the studied samples, Nitzschia transtagensis frustules were observed with length and width measurements consistent to those of the type material described by Morales et al. (2019), but with a higher fibulae density 8-11 in 10 m compared to 6-10 in 10 m reported by Morales et al. (2019).
Distribution
Nitzschia transtagensis was found in a single sample collected from the Torrent des Castellot Mountain stream located in the Art Municipality, northeast of the Majorca Island (Balearic Islands), coordinates 39 44' 16.24" N, 3 24' 30.07" W (Fig. 1). This stream was sampled during the autumn of 2005 and spring of 2006. The Torrent des Castellot Mountain stream is a tributary of the Torrent de sa Font des P, which flows into Cala Torta, NE of Majorca Island. Notably, Nitzschia transtagensis only occurred in one of the two samples collected from the Torrent des Castellot Mountain stream, accounting for an abundance of 2.6%. Nitzschia transtagensis Morales, Novais, Wetzel, Morais & Ector was exclusively found in the sample collected in autumn of 2005 from this specific locality. We visited the same location in May 2006 and in March and May 2008 to determine if the taxon was there, but it was impossible to take samples because the stream was dry.
Ecology
Nitzschia transtagensis was present in oligotrophic waters (0.052 mgl-1 of nitrate), with slightly alkaline pH values (7.8) and medium water conductivity (626.5 S cm-1). The values of these chemical parameters measured in May 2006 are provided in Table 1. The IPS index was 18.7 (over a maximum of 20) and the value of Shannon-Wiener (H') diversity index was 2.26 (Table 2). Within the diatom assemblage where N. transtagensis was found, a total of 20 different diatom species were identified. These species were: Achnanthidium minutissimum (Ktzing) Czarnecki (39.2%) (Fig. 3a-e), Gomphonema rosenstockianum Lange-Bertalot & Reichardt (28.9%) (Fig. 3f-l), Halamphora oligotraphenta (Lange-Bertalot) Levkov (20.4%) (Fig. 3m-r), Navicula cryptotenella Lange-Bertalot (2.3%), Navicula sp. 2 (1.6%), Navicula cincta (Ehrenberg) Ralfs (0.7%), Craticula halophila (Grunow) D.G.Mann (0.5%), Diploneis oblongella (Ngeli ex Ktzing) A. Cleve (0.5%), Halamphora montana (Krasske) Levkov (0.5%), Nitzschia frustulum (Ktzing) Grunow (0.5%), Navicula veneta Ktzing (0.5%), Encyonopsis microcephala (Grunow) Krammer (0.2%), Cymbella vulgata Krammer (0.2%) (Fig. 3s-w), Encyonopsis cesatii (Rabenhorst) Krammer (0.2%), Fragilaria rumpens (Ktzing) G.W.F.Carlson (0.2%), Gomphonema sp. Ehrenberg (0.2%), Luticola goeppertiana (Bleisch) D.G.Mann ex Rarick, S.Wu, S.S.Lee & Edlund (0.2%), Navicula sp. (0.2%) and Navicula genus Bory (0.2%). In the sample collected in the spring of 2006, where N. transtagensis was not present, water temperature and electrical conductivity were higher (14.3C and 938.9 S cm-1) and the assemblage was less diverse, being mainly dominated by A. minutissimum (92.3%) and H. oligotraphenta (3.8%).
Discussion
In this study, we reported a new record of Nitzschia transtagensis in a temporary stream on Majorca Island. Specifically, this species was found in the periphyton community attached to the submerged stones in the stream known as Tte des Castellot (Majorca). The habitat of Nitzschia transtagensis was characterised by waters with medium electrolyte content, compared with water of other temporary streams of Majorca Island (Delgado et al. 2012), although somewhat higher than in the type locality from Portugal (626.5 vs. 237 S cm-1) (Morales et al. 2019). The pH value at this temporary stream was slightly alkaline (7.8), whereas at the type locality, it was alkaline (8.4). Furthermore, the water temperature (7.8 vs. 21.3C) and the nutrient content (0.05 vs. 0.89 mg NO3 l-1; < 0.001 vs. 0.4 mg PO4 l-1) measured within this study were lower than those from the type locality spring. The study area demonstrated lower nutrient content compared to other calcareous geographical regions (Poikane et al. 2019). In regions characterised by higher nutrient content, nutrients emerged as the most influential variables in explaining the variation in diatom species composition (Gonzlez-Paz et al. 2020). The genus Nitzschia is considered tolerant to pollution (Hill et al. 2001). In fact, it has been shown that an improvement in diatomological indices and, consequently, water quality, leads to a reduced occurrence of Nitzschia species (Gonzlez-Paz et al. 2022). However, the occurrence of Nitzschia transtagensis is more than four times higher in our locality, which has a low concentration of nutrients.
The most abundant species where N. transtagensis was found were A. minutissimum, G. rosenstockianum and Halamphora oligotraphenta. These taxa are common in temporary streams across the Balearic Islands (Delgado et al. 2012, Delgado and Pardo 2015). All three species exhibit high IPS sensitivity values above 5.0. A. minutissimum has been reported from alkaline and acidic, oligotrophic and hypertrophic waters, being considered a ubiquitous species (Potapova and Hamilton 2007). Similarly, G. rosenstockianum has been found in oligo- to [BETA]-mesosaprobic waters, although it can be found in alpha-mesosaphrobic waters. It is considered an alcaliphilous species (Lange-Bertalot 1993, Novais et al. 2009). However, Halamphora oligotraphenta is considered a reliable indicator for oligotrophic to weakly mesotrophic waters with low to average electrolyte content (Lange-Bertalot and Metzeltin 1996). The Mediterranean Region is already known as a biodiversity hotspot; furthermore, intermittent rivers are also well recognised as highly diverse (Novais et al. 2020). The Shannon-Wiener diversity value was high, similar to values reported in other Mediterranean temporary streams (Morais et al. 2004, Novais et al. 2020). Moreover, other studies state that IPS values above 17 suggest a high ecological status (Noga et al. 2014).
Morphological characteristics of our specimen conform to Nitzschia transtagensis current description. Frustules found in the examined material have similar dimensions to those of the type material. The length and width of the frustules found in Majorca Island might be included within the dimensions proposed by Morales et al. (2019) in Portugal (34.6 - 40.0 [MU]m long, 4.0 - 5.3 [MU]m wide). However, in the study material, the fibulae range is higher (8-11 in 10 [MU]m vs. 6-10 in 10 [MU]m) compared to the type material (Morales et al. 2019). From a comparative examination of the description, our taxon corresponds to that described by Morales et al. (2019) and not to the Sardinian morphotype Nitzschia (aff.) ebroicensis reported by Lange-Bertalot et al. (2003) from Sardinian pools.
In literature, we did not find many other species of Nitzschia that could be confused with Nitzschia transtagensis, frustules with nitzschioid symmetry, lanceolate with one convex side of the raphe and the opposite side distinctly undulated nor are common in the genus Nitzschia. For this reason, there is still a lack of information about the ecology of this species. Due to the presence only in one sample of Tte de Castellot (Majorca), the ecological preferences of N. transtagensis are still open.
